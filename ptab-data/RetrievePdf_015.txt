Patent 5,500,819
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
Toshiba Corporation, Toshiba America, Inc., Toshiba America Electronic
Components, Inc., and Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. (collectively,
“Petitioner”) filed a Petition (Paper 1, “Pet.”) to institute an inter partes review of
claims 1–11 and 17–19 of U.S. Patent No. 5,500,819 (Ex. 1001, “the ’819 patent”).
See 35 U.S.C. § 311. Intellectual Ventures II LLC (“Patent Owner”) filed a
Preliminary Response (Paper 6, “Prelim. Resp.”). Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 314, in
our Decision to Institute (Paper 7, “Dec.”), we instituted this proceeding as to
claims 1–11 and 17–19 of the ’819 patent. Dec. 19.
Patent Owner filed a Patent Owner Response (Paper 15, “PO Resp.”) and
Petitioner filed a Corrected Petitioner’s Reply to Patent Owner’s Response
(Paper 23, “Reply”). An oral hearing in this matter was held on May 6, 2015
(Paper 27, “Tr.”).
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c). This Final Written Decision is
issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73. For the reasons that
follow, Petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that claims
1–11 and 17–19 of the ’819 patent are unpatentable.
B. Related Matters
Patent Owner has sued Petitioner for infringement of the ’819 patent in
Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Toshiba Corp., No. 1:13-cv-00453 (D. Del.). Pet. 1;
Paper 5 (Patent Owner’s Mandatory Notices).
C. The ’819 Patent
The ’819 patent, titled “Circuits, Systems and Methods for Improving Page
Accesses and Block Transfers In A Memory System,” issued on March 19, 1996,

2

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
and addresses control circuitry that controls the exchange of data between
read/write circuitry and first and second slave circuitry. Ex. 1001, Abstract. The
’819 patent discloses circuits for improving page accesses and block transfers in
memory. Id. at 1:7–10. The “invention provide[s] for the construction of a
memory which includes an array of volatile memory cells, address decode circuitry
for selecting rows and/or columns of cells in the memory array, and master sense
amplifier circuitry for reading and writing data into those selected cells.” Id. at
2:52–57. The invention also includes “[a]t least two sets of latching circuitry . . .
coupled to the master sense amplifiers for temporarily storing data being
exchanged with the master sense amplifiers during read and write operations to the
array of memory cells.” Id. at 2:57–61.
Figure 2 of the ’819 patent, shown below, provides an exemplary block
diagram of the memory system disclosed.

Figure 2 depicts a block diagram of memory system 200 with an M x N array of
flash memory cells 201, with wordlines (rows) 203 and bitlines (columns) 204.
Id. at 5:52–57, 3:25–26. Representative memory cell 202 is located at the

3

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
intersection of wordline 203 and bitline 204. Id. at 5:58–60. “[Bitlines] 204 of
memory array 201 are coupled to a bank 208 of master sense amplifiers,” which
are coupled via “bus 209 to a first bank 210 (bank 1) of slave sense amplifiers and
a second bank 211 (bank 2) of slave sense amplifiers.” Id. at 6:8–12. “Slave sense
amplifier banks 210 and 211 are further coupled by a local data I/O bus 212 to
column decoder circuitry 213.” Id. at 6:12–14. The challenged claims are directed
to a memory that includes control circuitry that controls the sensing of data from
cells via the master sense amplifiers, the temporary storage of those data in the first
and second bank of slave sense amplifiers, and the rewriting of those data back in
the memory array at the same or different locations.
D. Illustrative Claims

II. ANALYSIS
A. Claim Construction
The ’819 patent, which was filed September 30, 1994 and issued March
1996, expired. See PO Resp. 13 n.1; Reply 4. “[T]he Board’s review of the claims
of an expired patent is similar to that of a district court’s review.” In re Rambus,
Inc., 694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Because the expired claims of the patent are
not subject to amendment, we apply the principle set forth in Phillips v. AWH
Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (quoting Vitronics Corp. v.
Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996)), that “words of a claim
‘are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning,’” as understood by a
person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention. “In
determining the meaning of the disputed claim limitation, we look principally to
the intrinsic evidence of record, examining the claim language itself, the written
description, and the prosecution history, if in evidence.” DePuy Spine, Inc. v.
Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 469 F.3d 1005, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing
Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312–17).
Petitioner asserts that claim terms should be given their ordinary and
customary meanings, as the patentee did not act as a lexicographer or provide
special meaning for any claim terms. Pet. 8. Patent Owner has not disputed
Petitioner’s conclusion and provides no alternate construction for any claim terms
on this record.
Based on the present record, we determine that no express claim
construction is necessary for any claim term for purposes of this Decision.

Patent 5,500,819
B. Asserted Prior Art
1. Ogawa ’577 (Ex. 1003)
Ogawa ’577 describes “[a] semiconductor memory device with shift
registers used for a video RAM.” Ex. 1003, Abstract. Specifically, Ogawa ’577
discloses “a memory cell array, bit lines, and word lines, a pair of shift registers,
and transfer gate circuits arranged between the bit lines and the shift registers.” Id.
Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577, reproduced below, shows a semiconductor memory
device with shift registers. Id. at 2:10–12.

Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577 shows “a dynamic RAM 1 of an open bit-line type, groups
of transfer gates 21 and 22, and shift registers 3 and 4.” Id. at 3:19–21. Data are
provided via input lines 32 and 42 of shift registers 3 and 4. Data also are
delivered through output lines 33 and 43 from shift registers 3 and 4. Id. at 3:22–
25. Figure 2 shows that “RAM 1 includes sense amplifiers 101, 102, . . . 10n”; “bit
lines (BL) 111, 112, . . . 11n”; “word lines (WL) 131, 132, . . . 13n”; and “bit lines
̅̅̅̅) 121, 122, . . . 12n.” Id. at 3:29–36. Ogawa ’577 discloses that shift registers
(BL

8

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
3 and 4 can be used for reading and writing in various combinations for the parallel
transfer of data between registers and for a scroll display operation.
2. JP ’832 (Ex. 1006)
JP ’832 is a Japanese counterpart application to Ogawa ’577. Pet. 8;
Ex. 1003, at [30] Foreign Application Priority Data; Ex. 1006, 1 (21) [Application
Number]. JP ’832 discloses the use of shift registers to transfer data from cells in a
selected row of a memory array to different cells in the selected row in the array.
Ex. 1006, 10–11.
JP ’832 relates to random access memory (RAM) equipped with a shift
register for high-speed reading and writing. Ex. 1006, 8. Figure 1 of JP ’832 is
shown below.

Figure 1 of JP ’832 shows a block diagram of open-bit-line RAM 10 with two shift
registers, SRA and SRB. Ex. 1006, 8–9. JP ’832 discloses a video RAM
comprising two shift registers SRA, SRB used to write a row of data into memory
cells at the intersection of wordlines (WL) and bitlines (BL and ̅̅̅̅
BL) of RAM
memory array 10. Ex. 1006, 9–10. JP ’832 further discloses reading data from one
portion of the array, storing that data in the shift registers SRA and SRB, and
writing that data in parallel to a different portion of the array or wordline (WL).

9

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
Ex. 1006, 10–11. Specifically, JP ’832 discloses writing via the shift registers,
SRA and SRB, from one wordline to a new wordline in array 10. Ex. 1006, Fig. 6.
Figure 6 of JP ’832 is shown below.

Figure 6 depicts shift registers SRA and SRB being used to transfer data from cells
in a selected row WLi in memory array 10, to different cells in the selected row
WLj in memory array 10 along with New Data inserted in a portion of shift
register A. Ex. 1006, 10–11. Figure 6(a) discloses that data of WLi is transferred
first to shift register SRB from DRAM 10. Figure 6(b) shows that WLi is then
transferred from SRB to shift register SRA, where new data may be serially added
from INA to SRA. Id. Figure 6(c) shows that the data of shift register SRA is
transferred in parallel back to different wordline WLj, although “the transfer
destination may be WLi rather than WLj.” Ex. 1006, 9–10.
3. Ogawa ’045 (Ex. 1005)
Ogawa ’045 shares an inventor with Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 and discloses a
“semiconductor memory device including a RAM and shift register for enabling
parallel transfer of a one-word line amount of data of the RAM portion between
the RAM portion and the shift register.” Ex. 1005, Abstract. Specifically,

10

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
Ogawa ’045 discloses a VRAM memory circuit, that has a bit line/sense amplifier
configuration like that of Ogawa ’577, and that writes data stored in a shift register
1 to memory cells formed at the intersection of wordlines (“WL”) and bitlines
̅̅̅̅”) through “sense amplifiers No. 1 to No. 8” for “making either of
(“BL” and “BL
̅̅̅̅̅, BL2 and BL2
̅̅̅̅̅, . . . an H (high) level and the other an L
the bit lines BL1 and BL1
(low) level.” Ex. 1005, 3:56–58, 3:40–65. Figures 1A and 1B of Ogawa ’045 are
provided below.

Figures 1A and1B (collectively, Figure 1) illustrate a schematic of prior art video
RAM that uses shift register (SR) to write to BL-2 or ̅̅̅̅
BL-2 via sense amplifiers
(Sense Amp No. 2). Ex. 1005, 3:40–65, 2:40–41. Shift registers 101 to 108 are
serial input shift registers. Id. at 2:67–3:1. The RAM of Figure 1 has eight pairs of
̅̅̅̅-1 to BL
̅̅̅̅-8. Id. at 3:2–4. The RAM also has eight
bit lines BL-1 to BL-8 and BL
sense amplifiers No. 1 to No. 8 arranged at the center of Figure 1. Id. at 3:5–7.
The pairs of BL and ̅̅̅̅
BL bitlines are connected through the sense amplifiers. Id. at
3:9–11.

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
C. Asserted Grounds of Unpatentability
1. Obviousness of Claims 1–11 and 17–19 over Ogawa ’577
(Ex. 1003), Ogawa ’045 (Ex. 1005), and JP ’832 (Ex. 1006)
With respect to claims 1–6, Petitioner provides claim charts, as well as the
Declaration of Robert Murphy (Ex. 1004), in support of its contention that the
disclosure in Ogawa ’045 (Ex. 1005) teaches the common technique of using a
sense amplifier on a bit line to write data stored in a shift register to either BL or
̅̅̅̅. Pet. 24–25 (citing Ex. 1004 ¶¶ 32, 33); Ex. 1005, 3:40–65. Petitioner also
BL
contends that the combination of the disclosure in Ogawa ’577 with the techniques
known to one of ordinary skill in the art as disclosed in Ogawa ’045 and JP ’832
render claims 1–6 and 17–19 obvious. Pet. 24–25, 32–33, 34–36. With respect to
claim 7–11, Petitioner provides claim charts showing the claim limitations and the
corresponding disclosure in JP ’832. Pet. 38–59. Petitioner also provides
argument and discussion regarding the disclosures of Ogawa ’045 and Ogawa
’577, and citations to the Murphy Declaration (Ex. 1004 ¶¶ 40–84) supporting the
argument that the cited references together render claims 7–11 obvious. Pet. 38–
60.
a. Scope of the Challenged Claims
Patent Owner contends that the challenged independent claims are limited to
a “move/copy operation …, which moves data to slave circuitry and then writes the
data to memory using the same slave circuitry.” PO Resp. 12. Patent Owner
further avers that the ’819 patent confers significant advantages over the
Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 data transfer methods, which insert an additional write
operation from one bank of alleged slave circuitry to a different alleged bank of
slave circuitry prior to writing data to the memory array. PO Resp. 2 (citing
Ex. 2001, Declaration of William R. Huber, D.Sc., P.E., ¶¶ 33–34), 4. Relying on
12

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
the Declaration of Dr. Huber, Patent Owner argues that independent claims 1, 7,
and 17 and the ’819 patent specification require that data is read from the memory
array to a bank of slave sense amplifiers and then data is written from the same
bank of slave sense amplifiers to the memory array. PO Resp. 7 (citing Ex. 2001
¶ 32).
Patent Owner’s arguments are not commensurate in scope with language in
the claims themselves. Claim 1 recites sensing data by master read/write circuitry
and transferring “said data” to one of two slave circuits and “writing of said data
through said master read/write circuitry.” Ex. 1001, 8:35–43. Thus, claim 1
requires writing “said data” back to memory through the master read/write
circuitry, but does not require writing such data by use of the same slave circuit.
Independent claim 7 has similar limitations. Id. at 9:15–20.
Claim 17 requires writing “the data stored in the slave sense amplifiers”
back to memory through the master sense amplifiers. Id. at 12:1–3. Specifically,
claim 17 latches the data read from a selected row into “a bank of slave sense
amplifiers” and “writ[es] the data stored in the slave sense amplifiers through the
master sense amplifiers to different cells in the array.” Id. at 11:17–12:3. Here,
claim 17 recites writing of the data “through the master sense amplifiers” and does
not limit the writing only to the same bank of slave sense amplifiers. It is
informative that claim 18, which depends from the broader independent claim 17,
explicitly recites a step of writing data from one set of slave sense amplifiers to a
second set of slave sense amplifiers and then writing that data into different cells in
the array. In sum, data can be moved to a different slave sense amplifier before
being written back to the array to comply with independent claim 17 and
dependent claim 18.

13

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that claim
17 is limited to the same data using the same slave sense amplifiers. We note that
Patent Owner’s Response fails to discuss the scope of claim 18, which depends
from independent claim 17. See generally PO Resp. 43 (referencing challenged
dependent claims). Patent Owner’s argument at the hearing that both claim 17 and
claim 18 are limited to transfers of data within the same bank of slave sense
amplifiers (Tr. 30:9–22) is not supported by the plain reading of the limitations
(Ex. 1001, 11:17–12:3).
In addition, Patent Owner’s arguments that independent claims 1, 7, and 17,
are limited to the same data using the same sense amplifiers improperly read
limitations from the specification into the claims. See Thorner v. Sony Comput.
Entm’t Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Patent Owner’s
arguments rely heavily on the ’819 patent’s description of the so-called
“move/copy” operation using the same slave circuitry. See PO Resp. 1–7
(discussing advantages of move/copy operation). Limitations should not be
imported from preferred embodiments into the claims absent a clear disclaimer of
claim scope in the specification. See In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech Ctr., 367 F.3d
1359, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Patent Owner has not identified such a clear
disclaimer of claim scope in the specification of the ’819 patent.
Patent Owner argues that the specification as a whole excludes or disavows
the interbank transfer among the slave circuitry in the copying of data back into the
array. Tr. 41:24–42:17. Patent Owner has not shown, however, that the intrinsic
evidence limits the independent claims to copying data using the same slave
circuitry (or slave sense amplifiers). Indeed, for example, the file history shows
that the Applicant amended the independent claims by adding the copying and
slave sense amplifier limitations at issue, and described the amendment as being
14

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
directed to writing the same data back through associated slave circuitry, but not
expressly requiring the same slave circuitry. Ex. 1002, 49–52, 55–56, 59–60. As
stated above, claims 1, 7, and 17 recite that the data is written to the array
“through” the sense amplifier. We are not persuaded that claims 1, 7, and 17 are
limited to copying of data using only the same sense amplifiers.
Finally, we also are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that
Petitioner’s expert, Dr. Murphy, agrees that the scope of claim 1 is limited to use
of the same slave circuitry. PO Resp. 14 n.8 (citing Ex. 1002, 32:14–33:14);
Tr. 35:18–36:22. We find that Dr. Murphy’s testimony merely addresses the
description of the ’819 patent specification (Ex. 1002, 32:14–33:14) and not the
scope or interpretation of claim 1. We do not agree with Patent Owner’s argument
that the embodiments and general description of the ’819 patent limit the claims to
use of the “same” sense amplifier for the copy functions. Accordingly, we
conclude that independent claims 1, 7, and 17 do not require copying of the data
using the same slave circuitry.
b. The Prior Art
Petitioner contends that the combination of the disclosure in Ogawa ’577
with the techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, as disclosed in
Ogawa ’045 and JP ’832, renders claims 1–6 and 17–19 obvious. Pet. 24–25, 32–
33, 34–36. Petitioner cites the Murphy Declaration in support of the understanding
of one of ordinary skill in the art with respect to the cited references. Pet. 28–38
(citing Ex. 1004 ¶¶ 20, 26, 27, 32–36, 38, 39). Petitioner further contends that the
combination of Ogawa ’577 and Ogawa ’045, from the same inventor and field of
technology, “would have made it obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that
data written from the slave circuitry (shift registers 3 and 4) to the cells of the
memory array (RAM 1) is written through the master read/write circuitry (sense
15

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
amplifiers 101, 102, 103, . . . , 10n).” Pet. 25 (citing Ex. 1004 ¶ 33). Specifically,
Petitioner asserts that the block data transfer in JP ’832, in combination with the
scroll display operation in Ogawa ’577, teaches the limitations of dependent claims
18 and 19, which require writing the data via the master sense amplifiers to
different memory cells in the selected row. Pet. 33–38. Petitioner also provides
claim charts and citations to the Murphy Declaration (Ex. 1004 ¶¶ 38–39) in
support of its argument that JP ’832, Ogawa ’577, and Ogawa ’045 teach the
limitations of claims 18 and 19.
We agree with Petitioner’s expert, Dr. Murphy, that one of ordinary skill in
the art would have understood that, during the scroll display operation of
Ogawa ’577, the data is sensed, written, and transferred back to the memory array
through the sense amplifiers. Ex. 1004 ¶ 32. Similarly, we find Dr. Murphy’s
testimony credible that the block data transfer process in JP ’832 and scroll display
operation in Ogawa ’577 teach writing data via master sense amplifiers to the same
or different locations in the memory array. Ex. 1004 ¶¶ 37–39. Based on such
evidence and the record overall, we determine that Petitioner has established that
the combination of Ogawa ’577 and Ogawa ’045 teaches the writing of data stored
in shift registers to memory cells at the intersection of wordlines and bitlines
through sense amplifiers. Ex. 1004 ¶ 33. We find that Petitioner has shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that Ogawa ’577, Ogawa ’045, and JP ’832 teach
the limitations of claims 1–11 and 17–19.
We address Patent Owner’s arguments that the prior art does not teach or
suggest the limitations of the challenged claims below.
Because Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 both use multiple different alleged slave
circuitry, Patent Owner alleges that these references do not teach or suggest the use

16

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
of the same slave circuitry as required in claims 1, 7, and 17. PO Resp. 9–11.
Patent Owner further argues that Ogawa ’577, JP ’832, and Ogawa ’045 each
disclose using different slave circuits for writing data. PO Resp. 15–25. We
disagree with Patent Owner. As discussed above, claims 1, 7, and 17 of the ’819
patent do not exclude the use of an intervening slave sense amplifier when writing
data “through” a sense amplifier. Indeed, claim 18, which depends from
independent claim 17, indicates that such an intermediate transfer among slave
sense amplifiers is within the scope of the broader independent claim 17.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument regarding the use
of different slave circuitry in the writing process by Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832.
Patent Owner also contends that Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 disclose writing
data to memory without sense amplifiers. PO Resp. 32–35; Ex. 2001 ¶¶ 70–72,
Figs. 9, 10. Thus, Patent Owner contends that Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 do not
teach or suggest writing data through the sense amplifiers into the memory array.
PO Resp. 32–35. We are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument or cited
expert testimony that rely on alternate arrangements to construct an embodiment
that does not use sense amplifiers to write data to the memory. Id. Patent Owner
relies on a single embodiment in Ogawa ’577 that purports to write data to the left
and right portions of an array using only shift registers. PO Resp. 34. Patent
Owner’s arguments for JP ’832 also rely on a similar circuit arrangement found in
alternate embodiments. PO Resp. 34 (citing Ex. 1006, 4). These alternate circuit
arrangements, however, do not negate the express teaching of Ogawa ’577 that
“[a] pair of data busses (not shown [in Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577]) are provided
along the sense amplifiers 101, 102, 103, . . . , 10n for writing or reading the data.”
Ex. 1003, 3:34–36. In addition, we credit the testimony of Petitioner’s expert,
Dr. Murphy, who states that it was common to use sense amplifiers in write
17

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
operations and that Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577 teaches the use sense amplifiers and
bitlines to write to data on the left and right sides of the memory array. Ex. 1004
¶ 28; see also Ex. 2002, 64:10–65:1, 69:1–71:6. We determine that Petitioner has
established that Ogawa ’577 teaches writing data through the sense amplifiers.
c. Control Circuitry of Claims 1 and 7
Claim 1 recites: “A memory comprising: . . . control circuitry for controlling
exchange of data . . . .” Claim 7 recites: “A memory system comprising: . . .
control circuitry . . . including mode control circuitry . . . and multiplexer control
circuitry . . . .” Petitioner contends that one of ordinary skill in the art would have
recognized that control circuitry, not explicitly illustrated in Figure 2 of
Ogawa ’577, is inherent to generating the signals used to control the exchange of
data between the master read/write circuitry (sense amplifiers) and the first and
second slave circuitry (shift registers 3 and 4), as expressly disclosed in
Ogawa ’577. Pet. 16 (citing Ex. 1004 ¶ 23). Thus, Petitioner asserts that the
control circuitry is disclosed inherently in Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577. Id.
Petitioner has shown sufficiently that such control is inherent in the memory
system to execute the read/write circuitry and slave circuitry as disclosed in
Ogawa ’577. Pet. 16. We agree with Petitioner that “[o]ne of ordinary skill in the
art would have recognized that although control circuitry is not explicitly
illustrated in Figure 2 [of Ogawa ’577], control circuitry is required to operate
every element shown in the figure, including generating the first and second
control signals that control transfer gates 21 and 22, respectively.” Pet. 16 (citing
Ex. 1004 ¶ 23). Patent Owner does not dispute that control circuitry is present
inherently, but disagrees with where a person of ordinary skill in the art would
understand it is located with respect to Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577. PO Resp. 36, 38–
40. Accordingly, Patent Owner’s argument and expert testimony arbitrarily places
18

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
the inherent control circuitry outside of Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577. PO Resp. 37–38
(citing Ex. 20021 ¶ 76, Fig. 11, which shows control circuitry external to Figure 2
of Ogawa ’577).
We agree with Petitioner that control circuitry as recited in claim 1 would
“necessarily be provided to control the transfer gates . . . used to transfer data from
the master read/write circuitry . . . to the selected one of the first and or second
slave circuitry.” Pet 17 (citing Ex. 1004 ¶ 25), 19 (citing Ex. 1004 ¶ 26). We find
credible the testimony of Petitioner’s expert that control circuitry not shown
explicitly in Ogawa ’577 Figure 2 (but inherent) is required to operate the move
operation, such as the scroll operation. Ex. 1004 ¶ 23. Patent Owner does not
dispute that a control circuit is necessarily present in Ogawa’s Figure 2. In
addition, Patent Owner does not provide evidence sufficient to outweigh
Petitioner’s evidence that the control circuit as inherently disclosed teaches or
suggests the claimed control circuitry of claims 1 and 7.See Par Pharm., Inc. v.
TWI Pharms., Inc., 773 F.3d 1186 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (stating that in order to rely on
inherency in an obviousness analysis, “the limitation at issue necessarily must be
present, or the natural result of the combination of elements explicitly disclosed by
the prior art”). Thus, after consideration of Patent Owner’s argument, we
nevertheless are persuaded, by Petitioner’s evidence, that the claimed control
circuitry of claims 1 and 7 are disclosed in Figure 2 of Ogawa ’577.
d. Column Decoder of Claim 7
Claim 7 recites “a column decoder coupled to each of the plurality of banks
of slave sense amplifiers.” Petitioner contends “that a column decode function
must be implemented to achieve the data shifting (shift-in or shift-out) function
performed by the scroll display operation.” Pet. 41 (citing Ex.1004 ¶ 44).
Specifically, Figure 6 of JP ’832 shows that data is shifted out of shift registers
19

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
SRA and SRB. Ex. 1006, 10–11. Petitioner has provided sufficient expert
testimony that this operation requires column addresses to identify the data shifted
in and out of the appropriate registers and that such a decoder would have been
obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Ex. 1004 ¶¶ 44, 45.
We are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that, because there are
alternate ways to implement the column decode function, the column decoder
limitation of claim 7 is not disclosed inherently in JP ’832. PO Resp. 41–42 (citing
Ex. 2001 ¶ 81). Petitioner has argued that the function was inherent or that it
would have been obvious to use a column decoder in the system of JP ’832.
Pet. 41–42 (citing Ex. 1004 ¶¶ 44–45 (stating that a column decoder was inherently
disclosed “or it would have been obvious to use a column decoder” to implement
the shifting performed in JP ’832)). Thus, Petitioner’s contention on the column
decoder of claim 7 does not rely on inherency alone. We credit the testimony of
Petitioner’s expert and conclude that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art to use a column decoder to implement the shift required in the scroll
display operation of JP ’832.
e. Teaching Away
Patent Owner contends that Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 teach away from being
combined with Ogawa ’045 (PO Resp. 26–37) because (1) the implementation of
Ogawa ’045’s techniques would be counter to the goals of Ogawa ’577 and
JP ’832 to quickly read data from and write data to memory (PO Resp. 26–28) and
(2) one of skill in the art would not combine the references because Ogawa ’577
and JP ’832 improve upon Ogawa ’045 and render the proposed combinations
improper (PO Resp. 28–32). The case law concerning teaching away makes clear
that “a reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary skill, upon
reading the reference, would be discouraged from following the path set out in the
20

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
reference, or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by
the applicant.” In re Gurley, 27 F.3d 551, 553 (Fed. Cir. 1994). As discussed
below, we are not persuaded that Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 teach away from being
combined with Ogawa ’045.
Patent Owner’s teaching away arguments rely on the stated goals and
improvements of Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 over Ogawa ’045. We agree with our
colleagues that “[t]here is no requirement that anything disclosed in a prior art
reference, such as its stated purpose, goal, or objectives, must be preserved or
further developed by every reliance on its teachings as prior art. All of the
disclosures of a prior art reference, including non-preferred embodiments, must be
considered.” Garmin Int’l v. Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC, Case IPR2012-00001,
slip op. at 36 (PTAB Nov. 13, 2013) (Paper 59) (citing In re Lamberti, 545 F.2d
747, 750 (CCPA 1976); In re Susi, 440 F.2d 442, 446 n.3 (CCPA 1971) (one is not
“taught away” from a “particularly preferred embodiment” by the suggestion that
something else may be even better)). We also note that it is not enough to
demonstrate that there are differences among the prior art references to show that
they teach away from Petitioner’s proposed combination. See In re Beattie, 974
F.2d 1309, 1312–13 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
In the present case, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s narrow reading
of the prior art references based on the goals and improvements of the Ogawa ’577
and JP ’832 references. A prior art reference must be considered for everything it
teaches by way of technology and is not limited to the particular invention it is
describing and attempting to protect. See EWP Corp. v. Reliance Universal Inc.,
755 F.2d 898, 907 (Fed. Cir. 1985). We are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s cited
evidence or argument that a person of ordinary skill, upon reading the Ogawa ’577
and JP ’832 references, would have been discouraged from combining these
21

IPR2014-00418
Patent 5,500,819
references with the teachings of Ogawa ’045. Accordingly, we disagree with
Patent Owner’s argument that Ogawa ’577 and JP ’832 teach away from being
combined with Ogawa ’045.
f. Conclusion of Obviousness
We have considered the arguments and evidence presented by the Petitioner
and Patent Owner. We conclude that Petitioner has shown that each element of
claims 1–11 and 17–19 is taught by the combination of Ogawa ’577, JP ’832, and
Ogawa ’045. We have considered Petitioner’s rationale to combine the prior art—
that it is from the same inventor and field of technology—and find it persuasive.
We have considered Patent Owner’s arguments and find them
unpersuasive. Finally, after considering the full record, we conclude that Petitioner
has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 1–11 and 17–19 would
have been obvious over Ogawa ’577, JP ’832, and Ogawa ’045.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance

of the evidence that claims 1–11 and 17–19 of the ’819 patent are unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as obvious over Ogawa ’577, JP ’832, and Ogawa ’045.
IV.

ORDER
For the reasons given, it is
ORDERED that, based on a preponderance of the evidence, claims 1–11 and

17–19 of U.S. Patent No. 5,500,819 are held unpatentable as obvious over
Ogawa 577, JP ’832, and Ogawa ’045;
FURTHER ORDERED, because this is a final written decision, the parties
to this proceeding seeking judicial review of our Decision must comply with the
notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
