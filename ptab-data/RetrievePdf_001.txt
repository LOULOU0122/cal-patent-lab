FINAL WRITTEN DECISION
35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73
I. INTRODUCTION
We have jurisdiction to hear this inter partes review under 35 U.S.C.
§ 6(c). This Final Written Decision is issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a)
and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73. For the reasons discussed herein, Petitioner has

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
shown by a preponderance of the evidence that claim 13 of U.S. Patent
No. 5,228,077 is unpatentable.
A. Procedural History
Petitioner, Universal Remote Control, Inc., filed a Petition for inter
partes review of claim 13 of U.S. Patent No. 5,228,077 (Ex. 1001, “the ’077
patent”). Paper 1 (“Pet.”). Patent Owner, Universal Electronics, Inc., filed a
Preliminary Response. Paper 7 (“Prelim. Resp.”). On January 6, 2015, we
instituted an inter partes review of claim 13 of the ’077 patent on one
ground of unpatentability, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 314. Paper 9 (“Dec.”).
Subsequent to institution, Patent Owner filed a Patent Owner
Response in both unredacted (confidential) form (Paper 14) and revised
redacted form (Paper 46, “PO Resp.”), along with a Motion to Seal
(Paper 16). Petitioner filed a Reply in both unredacted (confidential) form
(Paper 20) and revised redacted form (Paper 47, “Pet. Reply”), along with a
Corrected Motion to Seal (Paper 23).
Petitioner filed a Motion to Exclude (Paper 30, “Pet. Mot. to
Exclude”) certain portions of Exhibits 1053 and 1054. Patent Owner filed
an Opposition to the Motion to Exclude (Paper 37), and Petitioner filed a
Reply (Paper 39).
Patent Owner filed a Motion to Exclude (Paper 31, “PO Mot. to
Exclude”) Exhibit 1043, and portions of Petitioner’s Reply that rely on
Exhibit 1043. Petitioner filed an Opposition to the Motion to Exclude
(Paper 35), and Patent Owner filed a Reply (Paper 38). Patent Owner filed a
Motion for Observations (Paper 32), and Petitioner filed a Response to the
Observations (Paper 36).

A consolidated oral hearing for IPR2014-01102, IPR2014-01103,
IPR2014-01104, and IPR2014-01106 was held on August 19, 2015, and a
transcript of the hearing is included in the record (Paper 49, “Tr.”).
B. Related Matters
According to the parties, the ’077 patent is involved in the following
lawsuit: Universal Electronics, Inc. v. Universal Remote Control, Inc.,
No. SACV 13-00984-AG-JPR (C.D. Cal.). Pet. 1; Paper 4, 2.
C. The’077 Patent
The ’077 patent relates to a remote control that includes an input with
a set of keys or push buttons for inputting commands into the remote
control, infrared (IR) signal output circuitry for supplying an infrared signal
to a controlled device, and a central processing unit (CPU) coupled to the
input and to the signal output circuitry. Ex. 1001, Abstract, Fig. 8 (operating
circuitry), Fig. 9B (keyboard circuit). Memory is coupled to the CPU and
stores code data for creating IR lamp driver instructions for causing the
infrared signal output circuitry to emit infrared signals to control a variety of
devices. Id. Code data may be supplied from outside the remote control
through data coupling circuitry, which includes terminal structure, coupled
to the CPU. Id. Code data is supplied via a data transmission system that
includes coupling circuitry for coupling the terminal structure directly to a
computer, through a modem and telephone line to a computer, or to a
television set. Id.

Figure 20 of the ’077 patent is reproduced below:

Figure 20 is a fragmentary perspective view of a connector having
conversion circuitry and a battery case cover by which data can be input into
the random access memory of the operating circuitry of a remote control
device. Ex. 1001, 3:36–41. Signal coupling and converting assembly 206
includes connector assembly 207, cable 208, and cover plate 210 for battery
compartment 45 (Fig. 7). Id. at 18:41–44. Cover plate 210 has three pins
212, 214, and 216 on its underside, which are positioned to connect with
three serial ports 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 7) of the remote control device. Id. at
18:44–47. Pins 212, 214, and 216 are connected by three wire conductors
224, 226, and 228 in cable 208 to connector assembly 207, which contains
conversion circuitry 230. Id. at 18:47–51. Conversion circuitry 230
(Figs. 21, 22) enables using some of the nine sockets 250 of connector
assembly 207 for communication with serial ports 1, 2, and 3 via pins 212,
214, and 216. Id. at 18:51–57.

E. Ground of Unpatentability
We instituted an inter partes review on the sole ground that claim 13
is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over the combination of Ciarcia1
and Hastreiter.2
II. ANALYSIS
A. Real Party-in-Interest
Petitioner certifies that Universal Remote Control, Inc. (“URC”) is the
real party-in-interest. Pet. 1. Patent Owner, however, contends that
Petitioner failed to also name Ohsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Ohsung
Electronics U.S.A., Inc. (collectively, “Ohsung”), a supplier of products to
URC, as real parties-in-interest. PO Resp. 26–30.
Section 312(a) of Title 35 of the United States Code provides that a
petition for inter partes review under 35 U.S.C. § 311 may be considered
only if, among other things, the petition identifies all real parties-in-interest.
35 U.S.C. § 312(a)(2). Whether a non-identified party is a real party-ininterest to a proceeding is a highly fact-dependent question. Office Patent
Trial Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg. 48,756, 48,759 (Aug. 14, 2012) (“Trial
Practice Guide”) (citing Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880 (2008)). “A
common consideration is whether the non-party exercised or could have
exercised control over a party’s participation in a proceeding.” Trial
Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg. at 48,759 (citing Taylor, 553 U.S. at 895). The
concept of control generally means that “it should be enough that the
nonparty has the actual measure of control or opportunity to control that

U.S. Patent No. 4,667,181, issued May 19, 1987 (Ex. 1004).

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
might reasonably be expected between two formal coparties.” Id. (quoting
18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal
Practice & Procedure § 4451 (2d ed. 2011)).
Patent Owner argues that Ohsung exercised or could have exercised
control over Petitioner’s participation in this proceeding based on the close
relationship between Petitioner and Ohsung. PO Resp. 27. In support of
that argument, Patent Owner first directs us to evidence to support the notion
that URC and Ohsung share at least one employee. According to Patent
Owner, Mr. Jak You is a “key remote control executive [who] identifies
himself as both an Ohsung and URC employee.” Id. The evidence cited by
Patent Owner dates back to August 8, 2001 (Ex. 2019), July 16, 2012
(Ex. 2018), and July 2013 (Ex. 2021), and shows at most that Mr. You first
worked for Petitioner (URC) and then worked for Ohsung. Such evidence,
however, does not tend to show that Mr. You, around the time the Petition
was filed, held himself out as working for both Ohsung and Petitioner, or
that Ohsung and Petitioner share employees.
In any event, and even assuming that URC and Ohsung share an
employee, we do not agree with Patent Owner that such sharing of one
employee (Mr. You) suggests that Ohsung exercised or could have exercised
control over Petitioner’s participation in this proceeding. For instance,
Mr. You is said to have been a director of engineering for URC. Id. at 28.
Patent Owner has not shown that Mr. You was in a position within Ohsung
to persuade Ohsung or Petitioner to make a litigation decision to pursue an
inter partes review.
Moreover, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that
URC having previously paid for office space used by an Ohsung employee
7

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
suggests that Ohsung has reciprocated by paying for anything associated
with this proceeding or controlled the proceeding in any other way. See id.
at 28–29. If anything, the evidence tends to show that URC, not Ohsung,
pays for expenses such as the costs associated with this proceeding.
We also have considered Patent Owner’s argument that the closeness
of the relationship between Ohsung and URC is exemplified by a settlement
and license agreement (Ex. 2050) between Patent Owner and Petitioner, a
provision of which obligates Ohsung to pay royalties to Patent Owner. See
PO Resp. 29–30. Patent Owner argues that the agreement strongly suggests
that Ohsung may have had the opportunity to control, direct, or influence the
present proceeding. Id. at 30. The agreement was executed in 2004, and
provides for the payment of royalties in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Ex. 2050, 5,
9. Patent Owner has not shown that the agreement exemplifies a close
relationship in 2014 when the Petition in this proceeding was filed.
Moreover, the agreement and royalties are directed to a set of patents, none
of which is the patent involved in this proceeding. Id. at 1. Accordingly, we
are not persuaded by this argument.
Lastly, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that
because URC and Ohsung share litigation counsel in a related case, Ohsung
has controlled, or had the opportunity to control, this proceeding. See PO
Resp. 27. In summary, based on the totality of arguments and evidence
presented, we are not persuaded that Ohsung is a real party-in-interest in this
proceeding.
B. Claim Interpretation
The ’077 patent has expired and, thus, cannot be amended. For claims
of an expired patent, the Board’s claim interpretation is similar to that of a
8

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
district court. See In re Rambus, Inc., 694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 2012). “In
determining the meaning of the disputed claim limitation, we look
principally to the intrinsic evidence of record, examining the claim language
itself, the written description, and the prosecution history, if in evidence.”
DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 469 F.3d 1005, 1014
(Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312–17
(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc)). However, there is a “heavy presumption” that a
claim term carries its ordinary and customary meaning. CCS Fitness, Inc. v.
Brunswick Corp., 288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Construction of a
“means-plus-function” limitation under 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth paragraph,
involves two steps: first identifying the function explicitly recited in the
claim, and then identifying the corresponding structure set forth in the
written description that performs the particular function set forth in the
claim. Asyst Techs, Inc. v. Empak, Inc., 268 F.3d 1364, 1369–70 (Fed. Cir.
2001).
Petitioner proffers constructions for several means-plus-function
terms (Pet. 15–17), and Patent Owner weighs in on those constructions
(PO Resp. 4–13). For purposes of this Final Written Decision, we determine
that those terms do not require express construction. Patent Owner also
contends that Petitioner’s failure to propose a construction for “terminal
means” in accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth paragraph, is fatal to the
Petition. PO Resp. 2–3. We agree with Petitioner, however, that “terminal
means” as used in claim 13 is not a means-plus-function limitation requiring
an analysis under § 112, sixth paragraph, because the claim does not recite a
function performed by the “terminal means.” See Pet. Reply 11 (citing
Rodime PLC v. Seagate Tech., Inc., 174 F.3d 1294, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).
9

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
For this Final Written Decision, we determine that only the term
“code data” requires express construction, as the key dispute between the
parties focuses on that claim term. That term appears in the following
limitation of claim 13: “data coupling means including terminal means
coupled to said CPU for enabling code data for creating appropriate IR
lamp instructions for causing said infrared signal output means to emit
infrared signals . . . to be supplied from outside said remote control.”
Ex. 1001, 23:16–24 (emphasis added).
Patent Owner argues that “code data” means “instructions and timing
information for generating an infrared signal.” PO Resp. 14. Both parties
agree that the term “code data” includes timing information or data, but they
do not agree that the term “code data” also includes instructions.3 Id.;
Pet. Reply 4; Tr. 13, 40, 59. It is necessary for us to construe the phrase
because the parties dispute whether the prior art (Ciarcia) describes
supplying code data to the remote control from outside the remote control
(e.g., a computer connected through a cable to the remote control). In
particular, Patent Owner agrees that Ciarcia describes supplying timing data
to the remote control, but contends that Ciarcia does not describe supplying
instructions to the remote control. PO Resp. 17–19. For the reasons that
follow, we determine that “code data” includes timing information or data,
but need not include instructions.

3

Patent Owner refers to instructions as programming (computer
instructions) or computer executable instructions. PO Resp. 19; Ex. 2029
¶ 61; Tr. 66. Patent Owner contrasts instructions with timing information,
which, it submits, constitutes data. PO Resp. 16; Tr. 64.
10

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
We begin with the plain language of the claim. Claim 13 recites
“enabling4 code data for creating appropriate IR lamp instructions for
causing said infrared signal output means to emit infrared signals.” Based
on the words of the claim, “instructions” are created using “code data.”
Thus, the claim language differentiates “code data” from “instructions” and
expressly refers to “instructions” when the claimed subject matter is directed
to instructions. Moreover, claim 13 does not define or further explain what
“code data” means. For example, there is nothing in claim 13 that would
lead us to believe that data, albeit code data, should be construed to mean
data plus programming or executable computer instructions. The phrase is
“code data,” not “code data and instructions.”
We next turn to the Specification of the ’077 patent. Patent Owner
focuses on the following passage from the Specification of the ’077 patent in
support of its argument that code data includes instructions:
In the method for learning or acquiring code data for
infrared codes disclosed herein, no counting of pulses is carried
out. Instead the method involves the following steps:
(a) receiving a transmission of a train of pulses from a remote
control transmitter;
(b) recording the point-in-time of an edge of each pulse in a
train of the pulses;
(c) transforming the recorded point-in-time data into a list of
instructions for generating a replica of the train of pulses;
(d) timing the duration of a train of the pulses;
(e) timing the period between trains of pulses;

4

During oral hearing, counsel for Petitioner argued that due to the word
“enabling,” claim 13 does not require that anything actually be supplied
from outside the remote control. Tr. 87–88. This argument was not raised
prior to oral hearing, and therefore we do not consider it.
11

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
(f) associating a function key of the universal remote control
device 10 with the time duration of the train of pulses and
the list of instructions for generating a replica of the train
of pulses;
(g) determining whether or not repetitions of the transmission
of train of pulses is present;
(h) ignoring repetitions of the train of pulses;
(i) noting that repetitions are present; and
(j) storing for use in a universal remote control device, the
information acquired in steps (c), (d), (e), (f), and (i).
Ex. 1001, 9:52–10:7.
Patent Owner argues that step (c) identifies instructions, and steps (d),
(e), (f), and (i) identify timing information. PO Resp. 15. Patent Owner
further argues that Figure 14 and the corresponding text of the Specification
of the ’077 patent confirm that the phrase “code data” is different from an IR
code or signal, and is used to generate the IR code based on instructions and
timing data. Id. at 15–16 (citing Ex. 2029 ¶¶ 52–56). We have reviewed the
testimony of Patent Owner’s declarant, Mr. Alex Cook, in support of the
proposed construction. Neither he nor Patent Owner discusses any other
passages in the Specification of the ’077 patent. Rather, his explanation for
why we should narrowly construe “code data” focuses solely on one
embodiment of the Specification. See Ex. 2029 ¶¶ 51–56.
In contrast to the example cited by Patent Owner, there are several
passages in the ’077 patent that describe code data as separate and distinct
from instructions or instruction codes:
Incoming data is received serially at serial port 3 and conveyed
to input port 112, when it is desired to update the code data
and/or instructions in the RAM 54.
Ex. 1001, 8:28–31 (emphasis added).

12

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
After the infrared code is deciphered, the code data
therefor and instructions for generating such code (see the flow
chart in FIG. 14) are stored in a programming computer 200
(FIG. 10) and the device is programmed as explained below.
It is to be noted that the circuitry has no ROM and all
instruction codes and code data are loaded directly into the
RAM 54. This allows for infinite upgradability in the field via
the serial ports 1, 2, 3.
Id. at 8:45–53 (emphases added).
(6) The multiplexing of the address and data lines
between the RAM 54 and the CPU 56 enables scrambling of the
instruction codes and the code data so that the memory image
in the RAM 54 is encrypted.
Id. at 21:19–22 (emphasis added). In addition, the parent of the ’077 patent
teaches that only the timing information is part of “code data”: “In learning
the infrared code and transforming same to code data . . . , only the time
duration of the pulses . . . as well as the time duration of the pause between
bursts are sensed and used to learn and later to generate the infrared codes.”
Ex. 1007, 1:57–66 (emphasis added).
From the above passages, a person of ordinary skill in the art would
have understood that code data need not include instructions. In other
words, the above passages indicate that “instructions” or instruction codes
are separate from “code data.” If code data necessarily included instructions
or instruction codes, there would be no occasion for the Specification to
refer to instructions or instruction codes separately from code data. Yet, the
Patent Owner Response and the supporting testimony of Mr. Cook
(Ex. 2029) are silent with respect to these passages.
Lastly, the Specification of the ’077 patent describes that code data for
the infrared codes “may be obtained from vendor information sheets and
13

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
specifications, can be determined using the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,623,887 and 4,626,848, or by the method disclosed herein.”
Ex. 1001, 9:47–51. Again, the Patent Owner Response and the supporting
testimony of Mr. Cook (Ex. 2029) are silent with respect to this passage and
the other ways that code data may be obtained or determined. In summary,
there are many passages in the Specification of the ’077 patent that tend to
support not construing “code data” as Patent Owner would like, yet neither
the Patent Owner Response nor the supporting testimony of Mr. Cook
(Ex. 2029) discusses any of those other passages. Rather, Patent Owner’s
arguments and Mr. Cook’s testimony are confined to discussing only the one
embodiment that Patent Owner argues supports the contention that code data
always includes instructions. For the reasons discussed above, we are not
persuaded by Patent Owner’s arguments that “code data” necessarily
includes instructions. Based on the record before us, the term “code data”
includes timing information or data, but need not include instructions.
C. Obviousness over Ciarcia and Hastreiter
Petitioner contends that claim 13 is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as obvious over the combination of Ciarcia and Hastreiter. Pet. 41–
51. In its Petition, Petitioner explains how the combination of Ciarcia and
Hastreiter collectively meets each claim limitation and articulates a rationale
for combining the references. Id. Petitioner also relies on a Declaration of
Stephen D. Bristow to support the assertions made in connection with the
Petition. Ex. 1009.
Patent Owner argues that neither Ciarcia nor Hastreiter meets the
“code data” limitation of claim 13. PO Resp. 17–19. Patent Owner also
argues there is insufficient reason to combine Ciarcia and Hastreiter. Id. at
14

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
19–22. Lastly, Patent Owner argues that secondary considerations weigh in
favor of the nonobviousness of claim 13. Id. at 22–25. To support its
contentions, Patent Owner relies on a Declaration of Mr. Alex Cook
(Ex. 2029) and a Declaration of Mr. Ramzi Ammari (Ex. 2030).5
Ciarcia
Ciarcia describes a trainable remote control (Master Controller) with a
keypad for inputting commands into the remote control. Ex. 1005, 114.6
The remote control includes a central processing unit (CPU) (Intel 8031
microprocessor, IC1), memory (RAM IC11) coupled to the CPU, and
infrared LEDs and driver circuitry that produce an IR signal to a controlled
device. Id. at 114–115. The remote control may be connected to a personal
computer using three wires from an RS-232 interface. Id. at 119 (“The serial
connector is an RJ-11 telephone jack instead of the usual 25-pin DB-25
connector. Only three wires are required: data from the PC, data to the PC,
and signal ground.”). The personal computer is connected to the remote
control via the RS-232 interface and is “used to set up menus of devices
(receivers, CD players, tape decks) and functions for each device (turn on,
play forward, etc.).” Id. at 114. Once a menu is downloaded to the remote
control, each function is taught and tested, after which a completed menu
and synthesis data are uploaded to the personal computer and “stored on disk
(in case you want to load it into another Master Controller or add another
device later without retraining all of them).” Id.

5

Patent Owner also has filed a revised redacted version of Mr. Ammari’s
Declaration. Ex. 2064.

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
Hastreiter
Hastreiter describes keyboard data input assemblies, including
circuitry for minimizing the number of interconnections with a
microprocessor or other apparatus with which a keyboard is used. Ex. 1004,
1:5–10. In particular, Hastreiter describes a keyboard circuit that uses
diodes between row and column lines of the keyboard, similar to the
keyboard circuit described in the ’077 patent. See, e.g., Ex. 1001, Fig. 9B;
Ex. 1004, Figs. 1, 2.
Petitioner’s Assertions
Petitioner relies on Ciarcia to meet all of the limitations of claim 13,
with the exception of the “input means.” Pet. 41–51. Based on its
construction of “input means” to include at least the corresponding structure
of a keyboard circuit as shown in Fig. 9B of the ’077 patent, Petitioner relies
on the keyboard circuit of Hastreiter in combination with Ciarcia to meet the
“input means.” Id. at 15, 27–28, and 42–44. Petitioner points to teachings
in Hastreiter that the keyboard design can be used to minimize the required
number of interconnections with a microprocessor or other apparatus with
which a keyboard is used. Id. at 44; Ex. 1004, 1:5–11. Mr. Bristow opines
that skilled artisans at the time of the invention would have understood that
Hastreiter’s keyboard circuit could have been used in Ciarcia’s remote
control to minimize connections to the microprocessor. Ex. 1009 ¶ 60.
Code Data
Patent Owner does not contest that any feature is missing from the
combination of Ciarcia and Hastreiter other than supplying from outside the
remote control (e.g., a computer connected through a cable to the remote
control) “code data” to the remote control. PO Resp. 17–19. Petitioner
16

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
accounts for this limitation by relying on the description in Ciarcia of
downloading completed menu and synthesis data to the same or different
Master Controller. Pet. 20, 48; Ex. 1005, 114; Ex. 1009 ¶¶ 58–59; Tr. 31–
32.
According to Patent Owner, the code data limitation is missing
because Ciarcia does not describe supplying “code data” comprising
instructions from a computer to the remote control. PO Resp. 18–19. As
explained above in the claim construction section, Patent Owner has not
shown that “code data” necessarily includes instructions. Rather, as stated
above, “code data” includes timing information or data, but need not include
instructions, e.g., programmable software code. Patent Owner concedes that
Ciarcia describes downloading timing information to the remote control.
Id. at 18; Ex. 1053, 357; Tr. 41.
Based on the record before us, Petitioner has shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that all of the limitations in claim 13 are met
by the combination of Ciarcia and Hastreiter.
Combining Ciarcia and Hastreiter
Patent Owner argues that it would not have been obvious to combine
Ciarcia and Hastreiter. PO Resp. 19–22. As explained above, Petitioner
articulates a rationale with supporting evidence for combining Ciarcia and
Hastreiter. In particular, Petitioner points to teachings in Hastreiter that the
keyboard design can be used to minimize the required number of
interconnections with a microprocessor or other apparatus with which a
keyboard is used. Pet. 44; Ex. 1004, 1:5–11. Mr. Bristow opines that skilled
artisans at the time of the invention would have understood that Hastreiter’s
keyboard circuit could have been used in Ciarcia’s remote control to
17

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
minimize connections to the microprocessor. Ex. 1009 ¶ 60. Accordingly,
we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s conclusory assertion that “[t]he
Petition fails to articulate any reason why one having ordinary skill in the art
would have been motivated to combine Ciarcia with Hastreiter.” PO
Resp. 19.
Patent Owner also argues that because Hastreiter says nothing about
remote controls, it is not in the same field as Ciarcia, directing attention to
Mr. Cook’s testimony, who testifies to the same. Id. at 20; Ex. 2029 ¶ 74.
The test for determining whether a prior art reference constitutes analogous
art to the claimed invention is: (1) whether the prior art is from the same
field of endeavor, regardless of the problem addressed, and (2) if the
reference is not within the field of the inventor’s endeavor, whether the
reference still is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which
the inventor is involved. See In re Bigio, 381 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir.
2004).
Here, Patent Owner has not explained sufficiently why Hastreiter is
from a field of endeavor different from that of the claimed invention. Patent
Owner’s comparison between the fields of endeavor of Ciarcia and
Hastreiter misses the mark. In any event, Patent Owner’s argument that
Hastreiter is not in the same field as Ciarcia is conclusory, as is Mr. Cook’s
testimony. Neither explains why that is so. In addition, Patent Owner has
not addressed the second prong of the above test. And, importantly, during
cross-examination, Mr. Cook testified that the field of “keypad design is
inherently a field that people in remote controls are aware of.” Ex. 1053,
427:21–25. Such a statement would tend to support a finding that Hastreiter
is analogous art. Hastreiter is concerned with circuitry interconnections
18

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
between a microprocessor and a keyboard data input assembly and even
goes as far as to state that it is applicable for apparatuses that use keyboards.
Ex. 1004, 1:5–10. The claimed invention recites a remote control (an
apparatus) with an input means including a set of keys or pushbuttons for
inputting commands (e.g., a keyboard), where the input means is coupled to
a microprocessor, which processes the commands. Based on the record
before us, we find that Hastreiter is analogous art.
Patent Owner also argues that Ciarcia teaches away from any
combination with Hastreiter. PO Resp. 21. Patent Owner argues that the
keypad arrangement disclosed in Hastreiter is unnecessarily complex to be
used in Ciarcia’s remote, and that a person of ordinary skill in the art would
not have looked to Hastreiter for a keyboard data input assembly that
minimized the number of diode switches used (interconnections) because the
Ciarcia remote control only has six keys, such that minimizing
interconnections would not be a concern. Id.; Ex. 2029 ¶¶ 67–73, 81, 83.
We are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s arguments.
Hastreiter is not limited to only keyboards “having a large number of
hard keys,” as Mr. Cook asserts. Ex. 2029 ¶ 78. Rather, Hastreiter explains
that although a five by five array of keyboard conductors is shown, a person
having ordinary skill in the art would have understood that “the present
invention may be easily adapted to a square matrix of any size.” Ex. 1004,
3:31–34. For this reason, we do not give substantial weight to Mr. Cook’s
testimony that Hastreiter is limited to only keyboards having a large number
of keys, and thus is unnecessarily complex to be used in Ciarcia’s remote,
because that testimony is not supported by what Hastreiter actually conveys
to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For similar reasons, we do not give
19

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
substantial weight to Mr. Cook’s testimony that “Ciarcia’s remote control
would not benefit from Hastreiter’s keypad arrangement because Ciarcia’s
remote has very few keys” and that the “benefit of Hastreiter’s keypad
arrangement increases as the number of keys required grows larger.”
Ex. 2029 ¶ 83. Again, Hastreiter is not limited to only keypads with a large
number of keys, and even Mr. Cook recognizes that, although the benefit
may increase with more keys on a keypad, there is still a benefit from the
Hastreiter arrangement of reducing the number of electrical interconnections
between the keypad and the microprocessor. Id. “[I]f a technique has been
used to improve one device, and a person of ordinary skill in the art would
recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way, using the
technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill.”
KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 417 (2007).
Objective Evidence of Nonobviousness
Factual inquiries for an obviousness determination include secondary
considerations based on evaluation and crediting of objective evidence of
nonobviousness. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966).
Notwithstanding what the teachings of the prior art would have suggested to
a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the claimed invention, the
totality of evidence submitted, including objective evidence of
nonobviousness, may lead to a conclusion that the claimed invention would
not have been obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art. In re Piasecki,
745 F.2d 1468, 1471–72 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
There must be a demonstrated “nexus” between the merits of the
claimed invention and the evidence of secondary considerations before that
evidence is accorded substantial weight in an obviousness determination.

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
Simmons Fastener Corp. v. Ill. Tool Works, Inc., 739 F.2d 1573, 1575 (Fed.
Cir. 1984); Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., 713 F.2d 1530, 1539 (Fed.
Cir. 1983); see also In re Huang, 100 F.3d 135, 140 (Fed. Cir. 1996); In re
Fielder, 471 F.2d 640, 642 (CCPA 1973). “Nexus” is a legally and factually
sufficient connection between the objective evidence and the claimed
invention, such that the objective evidence should be considered in
determining nonobviousness. Demaco Corp. v. F. Von Langsdorff Licensing
Ltd., 851 F.2d 1387, 1392 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In the absence of an established
nexus with the claimed invention, secondary consideration factors such as
commercial success, satisfaction of a long-felt but unresolved need,
licensing, and copying by others are not entitled to much, if any, weight and
generally have no bearing on the legal issue of obviousness. See In re
Vamco Machine & Tool, Inc., 752 F.2d 1564, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
The burden of showing that there is a nexus lies with the Patent Owner. Id.;
see In re Paulsen, 30 F.3d 1475, 1482 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
Patent Owner argues that several of the patents owned by Patent
Owner, including the ’077 patent, were licensed by a substantial portion of
the industry, showing commercial acquiescence and competitor acceptance
of Patent Owner’s licensed patents. PO Resp. 23–24. The mere existence of
several licensees, without more specific information about the circumstances
surrounding the licensing, is not a good indicator of nonobviousness. In
EWP Corp. v Reliance Universal Inc., 755 F.2d 898, 907–08 (Fed. Cir.
1985), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated:
Such [licensing] programs are not infallible guides to
patentability. They sometimes succeed because they are
mutually beneficial to the licensed group or because of business
judgments that it is cheaper to take licenses than to defend
21

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
infringement suits, or for other reasons unrelated to the
unobviousness of the licensed subject matter.
Here, we are not told the circumstances surrounding the licenses.
Patent Owner directs us to no testimony from any licensee with regard to
why the licensee took a license from Patent Owner. It is unknown how
much of the decision to take a license stems from a business cost-benefit
analysis with regard to defending an infringement suit or from another
business reason, rather than from acknowledged merits of the claimed
invention. Patent Owner also does not disclose how many entities refused to
take a license or why some entities, if any, refused to take a license. Four
licensees may not represent a very successful licensing program if the field
of potential application of Patent Owner’s technology includes a large
number of potential licensees.
Patent Owner also argues that its upgradeable remotes and those of
one of its licensees (Logitech’s Harmony Remotes) have enjoyed
tremendous commercial worldwide success. PO Resp. 24. In particular,
Patent Owner argues that it is a market leader in original equipment
manufacturing of universal remote controls and made approximately $1.6
billion in worldwide gross sales from 2000 to 2013. Id. at 24–25. Patent
Owner argues that Logitech is the established market leader in consumer
universal remote controls since 2007 and that from 2007 through 2014,
Logitech averaged $100 million in worldwide net sales of remote controls, a
substantial number of sales containing the technology of the claimed
invention. Id. at 25.
Patent Owner does not describe for us the components or manner of
operation of the products sold by it or Logitech. Rather, Patent Owner
22

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
directs us to several paragraphs from the Ammari Declaration. Ex. 2064.7
Mr. Ammari directs us to claim charts that were created during litigation
between Patent Owner and Logitech, along with user manuals of several of
Logitech’s remote control products. Id. ¶¶ 20–24. Mr. Ammari testifies that
the manuals depict remotes that are upgradeable via a connection to a
computer and that when using a Harmony Remote, a user uses software or
an online service to configure downloaded code data to the remote control.
Id. ¶¶ 23, 24. Such a showing does not establish a nexus between the
alleged commercially successful products and the claimed invention.
First, we do not know the context of the litigation between Logitech
and Patent Owner, such as whether Logitech agreed to the charge of
infringement. Based on the record before us, Patent Owner has not
established that the infringement charts are meritorious insofar as showing a
nexus is concerned. Moreover, Patent Owner has not shown sufficiently that
any of the Logitech manuals would have conveyed to a user to use
“Logitech’s desktop software or an online service to configure downloaded
code data to the remote control” as Mr. Ammari contends. Ex. 2064 ¶ 24.
We do not give much weight to Mr. Ammari’s testimony in this regard
because it is conclusory. He does not direct us to where in any of the
manuals there is a description of configuring a remote control to download
code data to the remote control.
In any event, we do not know why $100 million of Logitech’s or
$1 billion of Patent Owner’s sales constitutes commercial success. It is well
established that absolute sales numbers without market share data does not
7

At the time of his declaration, Mr. Ammari was employed by Patent Owner
and has been employed by Patent Owner since 1997. Ex. 2064 ¶¶ 1, 4.
23

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
establish commercial success. See, e.g., In re Huang, 100 F.3d at 140.
Patent Owner’s Response does not discuss and present market share
information.
In addition, Patent Owner must prove that the sales were a direct
result of the unique characteristics of the invention, and not a result of
economic and commercial factors unrelated to the quality of the patent
subject matter. In re Applied Materials, Inc., 692 F.3d 1289, 1299–1300
(Fed. Cir. 2012). In addition, “if the commercial success is due to an
unclaimed feature of the device,” or “if the feature that creates the
commercial success was known in the prior art, the success is not pertinent.”
Ormco Corp., v. Align Tech., Inc., 463 F.3d 1299, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see
also In re Kao, 639 F.3d 1057, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (requiring a
determination of “whether the commercial success of the
embodying product resulted from the merits of the claimed invention as
opposed to the prior art or other extrinsic factors”). Here, Patent Owner has
not directed us to evidence to explain the reasons for the alleged commercial
success of Logitech’s and Patent Owner’s remote controls.
For all of the foregoing reasons, Patent Owner has failed to establish
the necessary “nexus” between the evidence of alleged commercial success
and the invention claimed.
Conclusion
We have considered the entirety of the evidence before us, including
the evidence of obviousness and the evidence of licensing and commercial
success submitted by Patent Owner as indicia of nonobviousness. On
balance, the evidence of obviousness outweighs the evidence of
nonobviousness with respect to claim 13. The evidence of obviousness is
24

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
strong and the evidence of nonobviousness is weak, for the reasons
discussed above. All of Patent Owner’s arguments have been considered.
Petitioner has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that
claim 13 is unpatentable over the combination of Ciarcia and Hastreiter.
D. Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude
Patent Owner moves to exclude Exhibit 1043 and portions of
Petitioner’s Reply that rely on Exhibit 1043 as not relevant to the
proceeding. PO Mot. to Exclude 1. The parties refer to Exhibit 1043 as a
data sheet for an Intel 8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). Ciarcia
describes an 8254 PIT that is programmed to generate IR signals. Ex. 1005,
118–119. In its Reply, Petitioner relies on the 8254 PIT data sheet to show
the details of the 8254 PIT used in the Ciarcia described device. Pet.
Reply 14. We did not and need not consider such arguments or evidence in
connection with the Reply. We have determined that Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 13 is
unpatentable, without considering Petitioner’s arguments regarding the
details of the Intel 8254 PIT used in the device described in Ciarcia.
Accordingly, we dismiss Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude.
E. Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude
Petitioner moves to exclude portions of Exhibits 1053 and 1054,
which are deposition transcripts of Patent Owner’s witness, Mr. Alex Cook.
With respect to both exhibits, Petitioner moves to exclude portions of
Mr. Cook’s testimony for, among other reasons, being unreliable. Pet. Mot.
to Exclude 1. In particular, Petitioner moves to exclude Exhibit 1053 at
419:1–2, 419:14–15, 420:5–21, 421:8–422:2, and 422:9–13, and

25

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
Exhibit 1054 at 745:4–8, 745:15–746:1, 746:13–747:4, 747:11–16, 747:22,
748:2, 749:10–11, 749:17–21, and 750:23–751:3. Id.
Petitioner has not shown that Patent Owner relied on either
Exhibit 1053 or 1054 in support of its papers filed in this proceeding, nor do
we find that Patent Owner relied on either exhibit in support of its papers
filed in this proceeding. Moreover, Petitioner has not shown that it relied on
the objected to portions of either exhibit in support of its papers filed in this
proceeding, nor do we find that Petitioner relied on the objected to portions
of either exhibit in support of its papers filed in this proceeding. Because we
were not directed to the objected to portions of the evidence in any papers
before us, we did not and need not consider the objected to portions of
Exhibits 1053 and 1054 in rendering this decision. Accordingly, we dismiss
Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude.
F. Motions to Seal
Patent Owner and Petitioner each filed several papers (e.g., Paper 14)
and exhibits (e.g., Exhibits 1050 and 1051) under seal, along with motions to
seal (Papers 16 and 23) and a protective order (Ex. 2065). The motions are
unopposed and are granted.
There is an expectation that information will be made public where
the information is identified in a Final Written Decision, and that
confidential information that is subject to a protective order ordinarily would
become public 45 days after final judgment in a trial, unless a motion to
expunge is granted. 37 C.F.R. § 42.56; Office Patent Trial Practice Guide,
77 Fed. Reg. at 48,761. In rendering this Final Written Decision, it was not
necessary to identify, or discuss in detail, any confidential information. A
party who is dissatisfied with this Final Written Decision may appeal the
26

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
Decision pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 141(c), and has 63 days after the date of
this Decision to file a notice of appeal. 37 C.F.R. § 90.3(a).
In view of the foregoing, the confidential documents filed in the
instant proceeding will remain under seal, at least until the time period for
filing a notice of appeal has expired or, if an appeal is taken, the appeal
process has concluded. The record for the instant proceeding will be
preserved in its entirety, and the confidential documents will not be
expunged or made public, pending appeal. Notwithstanding 37 C.F.R.
§ 42.56 and the Office Patent Trial Practice Guide, neither a motion to
expunge confidential documents nor a motion to maintain these documents
under seal is necessary or authorized at this time. See 37 C.F.R. § 42.5(b).
III. CONCLUSION
Based on the evidence and arguments, Petitioner has demonstrated by
a preponderance of the evidence that claim 13 of the ’077 patent is
unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as obvious over the combination of
Ciarcia and Hastreiter.
IV. ORDER
Accordingly, it is:
ORDERED that claim 13 of U.S. Patent No. 5,228,077 has been
shown to be unpatentable;
FURTHER ORDERED that the parties’ respective motions to seal are
granted;
FURTHER ORDERED that the parties’ respective motions to exclude
evidence are dismissed; and

27

IPR2014-01102
Patent 5,228,077
FURTHER ORDERED that, because this is a final written decision,
parties to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must
comply with the notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
