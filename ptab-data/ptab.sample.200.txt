ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on appe||ant’s request for rehearing (Paper No. 35) of our
decision mailed September 29, 2004 (Paper No. 34) sustaining the examiner's rejection
of claim 1 as being unpatentable over Rius and entering a new rejection of claims 2 and
3 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph. In other words, this is a decision both on
appellant's request for rehearing under 37 CFR § 41 .52(a)(1) with regard to the affirmed
rejection ot claim 1 and on appellant's request for rehearing under 37 CFR § 41 .50(b)(2)

with regard to the new ground of rejection of claims 2 and 3.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2004-2036 2

Application No. 09/885,264

We turn first to appe||ant’s request for rehearing of our decision sustaining the
rejection of claim 1 as being unpatentable over Rius. The basis of appellant's request
for rehearing appears to be that this panel overlooked or misapprehended the argument
on page 10 of appellant's brief, which alluded to distinctions between Rius and
appellant's invention, the “Water-Wipe" (W-W) system, pointed out by appellant in an
earlier communication, a copy of which was appended as page 33 of appellant's brief.
This, however, is not the case. As pointed out on pages 3-4 of our decision, these
alleged distinctions are not directed to limitations recited in appe||ant’s claim 1 and thus
are not relevant to the issue of the patentability of claim 1 over Rius.

With particular regard to appellant's reference to the “novelty of W-W's design”
and the "[s]imp|ified new and useful structure," of appellant's invention, it is the subject
matter of appellant's claims which is relevant in determinations of anticipation and
obviousness. As stated by our reviewing court in In re Hiniker Co., 150 F.3d 1362,
1369, 47 USPQ2d 1523, 1529 (Fed. Cir. 1998), “the name of the game is the claim."
Thus, while there may in fact be unobvious differences between the invention disclosed
by appellant and the disclosure of Rius, those differences have not been set forth in
claim 1. It is well established that only those features recited in appellant's claims can
be relied upon for patentability. E In re Self, 671 F.2d 1344, 1348, 213 USPQ 1, 5

(CCPA 1982).




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2004-2036 3

Application No. 09/885,264

For the foregoing reasons, appellant's request for rehearing does not persuade
us of any error in our decision to sustain the rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. § 103
as being unpatentable over Rius.

We turn next to appellant's request for rehearing of our decision entering a new
ground of rejection of claims 2 and 3 under the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112.
Appellant's explanation of the process of designing appellant's invention does nothing to
remedy the fact that appellant's claims 2 and 3 are drafted in language which renders
the scope of these claims unclear, for the reasons discussed on pages 5 and 6 of our
decision. It follows that appellant's request for rehearing fails to persuade us of any
error in our decision to enter a new ground of rejection of claims 2 and 3 under the
second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112.

CONCLUSION

Appellants’ request for rehearing has been granted to the extent of our
reconsidering our earlier decision but has been denied to the extent of our making any
modification to that earlier decision. The rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
being unpatentable over Rius remains affirmed and claims 2 and 3 remain rejected
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph. This decision on appe||ant’s overall appeal

is now final for purposes of judicial review.

ON BRIEF

Before MCQUADE, NASE, and BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.
BAHR, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on appellant's request for rehearing of our decision mailed
November 17, 2004, wherein we affirmed the examiner's decision to reject claims 9-11
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over Recchione in view of any of Lacey,
Dollman and Coultaus and unpatentable over Finch in view of any of Lacey, Dollman

and Coultaus. Notwithstanding appellant's reference to 37 CFR § 1.197, we have

treated this request under 37 CFR § 41 .52(a)(1) (effective September 13, 2004, 69 Fed.

Reg. 49960 (August 12, 2004), 1286 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 21 (September 7, 2004)).




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2004-2282 2

Application No. 09/989,555

Appellant's request for rehearing alleges that this panel committed two errors in
affirming the examiner’s decision. First, the request (page 9) urges that this panel
applied the incorrect legal standard for obviousness when we pointed out on pages 5-6
of our decision that

the differences between a springless and a spring-loaded

latch mechanism are not of such a nature that one of

ordinary skill in the art would have been dissuaded from

providing on the springless latch mechanism of either

Recchione or Finch an enlarged loop disposed through a

hole in the spring bolt, as taught by any of Lacey, Dollman

and Coultaus, to obtain the self-evident advantage of a

vehicle for applying a pulling force to the latch.
The above-quoted statement from our decision is not a statement of motivation for the
modification proposed by the examiner but, rather, a response to appe||ant’s argument
in the appeal brief (page 8) that the teaching by Lacey, Dollman and Coultaus of using a
loop in a spring-loaded bolt or latch to pull the bolt or latch to the open or unlocked
position against the bias of a spring, with closing movement of the latch being a result
only of a compressed spring returning to a relaxed position, in fact teaches away from
using a loop to close the latch. As to the specific question of "teaching away," our
reviewing court in In re Gurley, 27 F.3d 551, 553, 31 USPQ2d 1130, 1131 (Fed. Cir.
1994) stated:

A reference may be said to teach away when a person of

ordinary skill, upon [examining] the reference, would be

discouraged from following the path set out in the reference,

or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that
was taken by the applicant.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2004-2282 3

Application No. 09/989,555

Simply that there are differences between two references is insufficient to establish that
such references "teach away" from any combination thereof. E In re Beattie, 974
F.2d 1309, 1312-13, 24 USPQ2d 1040, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1992). As we pointed out in our
earlier decision, we do not consider the differences between the primary references
Recchione and Finch and the secondary references Lacey, Dollman and Coultaus,
namely, that the primary references are directed to springless latch mechanisms which
are manually moved in both directions while the secondary references are directed to
spring-loaded latch mechanisms which are manually pulled to the open or unlocked
position against the bias of the spring and are moved to the locked position by a return
of the spring to its relaxed state, to be of such a nature as to discourage a person of
ordinary skill in the art from using a loop in a springless latch to provide a convenient
vehicle for applying a pulling force to the latch, as appellant has done.

As for appellant's second argument (request, pages 9-10), that this panel has
substituted its hindsight opinion as to the obviousness of the invention, while
“obviousness cannot be established by combining the teachings of the prior art to
produce the claimed invention, absent some teaching or suggestion or incentive to do
so" (ACS Hosp. Sys., Inc. v. Montefiore Hosp., 732 F.2d 1572, 1577, 221 USPQ 929,
933 (Fed. Cir. 1984)), the motivation to modify the prior art “need not be expressly
stated in one or all of the references used to show obviousness" (Cable Electric
Products, Inc. v. Genmark, Inc., 770 F.2d 1015, 1025, 226 USPW 881, 886 (Fed. Cir.

1985); In re Bozek, 416 F.2d 1385, 1390, 163 USPQ 545, 549-50 (CCPA 1969)).




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2004-2282 4

Application No. 09/989,555

Rather, the test for obviousness is what the combined teachings of the references
would have suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art. Cable Electric, 770 F.2d at
1025, 226 USPQ at 886-87. Further, in an obviousness assessment, skill is presumed
on the part of the artisan, rather than the lack thereof. In re Sovish, 769 F.2d 738, 743,
226 USPQ 771, 774 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Insofar as the references themselves are
concerned, we are bound to consider the disclosure of each for what it fairly teaches
one of ordinary skill in the art, including the inferences which one of ordinary skill in the
art would reasonably have been expected to draw therefrom. E In re Boe, 355 F.2d
961, 965, 148 USPQ 507, 510 (CCPA 1966) and In re Preda, 401 F.2d 825, 826, 159
USPQ 342, 344 (CCPA 1968).

Having reviewed the entirety of the applied references, it is inconceivable to us
that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have failed to appreciate the role of the
ring or loop of Lacey, Dollman and Coultaus of providing a convenient vehicle for
applying a pulling force to the latch (see, for example, column 3, lines 42-45, of
Dollman). Further, to conclude that such a person would not have recognized that the
benefits of providing such a ring or loop as a convenient vehicle for applying a pulling
force apply equally to a springless latch wherein the latch is manually pulled in either
direction would be to improperly assume that the artisan possesses less than ordinary
skill. E/Q, 769 F.2d at 743, 226 USPQ at 774.

For the foregoing reasons, the arguments in appellant's request for rehearing fail

to persuade us that we committed any error in affirming the examiner's decision. Thus,




*** PAGE 5 ***

appellant's request for rehearing is granted to the extent of our reconsidering our earlier
decision but denied with respect to our making any modifications thereto.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal
may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

Application No. 10/106,951

ON BRIEF

Before HAIRSTON, KRASS, and NAPPI, Administrative Patent Judges.

HAIRSTON, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

In a decision dated January 14, 2005, the decision of the
examiner rejecting claims 1 through 4, 6, 7, l2, 15 through
18 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § l02(b) was affirmed, and the decision
of the examiner rejecting claims 20 through 22 under 35 U.S.C.
§ l03(a) was affirmed.

Appellants now argue (request, page 3) that:

The Decision dated 14 January 2005 fails to cite

anything in Moore which discloses that the
pipe/substrate (and not merely a side thereof) is




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2005-0243
Application No. 10/106,951

“position[ed] . . . within a substantially hermetically
sealed environment." Indeed, the Decision fails to
even mention this feature, instead treating claim 2 as
if it were one and the same as claim 1 . . . .

If the pipe is the substrate, at most according to
the reasoning of the Decision a side of the
pipe/substrate may be “position[ed] . . . within a
substantially hermetically sealed environment." But of
course, that is not what claim 2 recites. Applicants
respectfully submit that is [sic] it is very clear from

Moore that the substrate/pipe itself is never
“position[ed] . . . within a substantially hermetically

sealed environment." And so, the arrangement of Moore

cannot possibly anticipate the method of claim 2.

We agree with appellants’ arguments. The anticipation
rejection of claim 2 is reversed because Moore is incapable of
“positioning a substrate within a hermetically sealed
environment."

Turning to claim 15, appellants argue (request, pages 3 and
4) that Moore does not disclose the apparatus features recited in
this claim. The claimed “first chamber” makes this claim more
specific than claim 1. Thus, the anticipation rejection of claim
15 is reversed because Moore does not have such a chamber in
which “a substantially inert atmosphere can be generated." The
anticipation rejection of claims 16 through 18 is reversed
because they depend from claim 15.

Turning next to claims 1 and 23, appellants argue (request,

page 5) that Moore does not disclose measuring any permeation

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2005-0243
Application No. 10/106,951

rate of any substrate/encapsulation. We disagree. As stated in
our decision (pages 4 and 5), the permeation rate is measured by
observing the change in color of the reactive material. In other
words, the change in the color of the reactive material reflects
the amount of fugitive gas that the reactive material has been
exposed to after the fugitive gas has passed through or permeated
the wall of the substrate. Thus, we decline the appellants’
request to change the affirmance of claims 1 and 23, and claims
3, 4, 6, 7 and 12 which depend from claim 1.

The obviousness rejection of claims 20 through 22 is
reversed because Jung does not cure the noted shortcoming in the
teachings of Moore.

In summary, appellants’ request has been granted to the
extent that we have reversed the anticipation rejection of claims
2 and 15 through 18, and reversed the obviousness rejection of

claims 20 through 22.

MACDONALD, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is a decision on Appellants’ Request for Rehearing.

REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION DENIED.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2005-0686
Application 10/298,968

With full consideration being given to Appellants’ remarksl, we ﬁnd no basis upon which
to grant Appellants’ request.

Appellants present two arguments in the remarks. Firstly, Appellants argue at pages 1-2
that the “speciﬁcation clearly recites that the threshold based on the ‘perceived content’ is
different than the threshold based on a ‘category.’” Appellants’ support for this position is that
Appellants’ “speciﬁcation discloses at least two mechanisms for setting or adjusting a threshold"
and Appellants’ speciﬁcation uses the word “altematively” to show that the disclosed
mechanisms differ. These two points we accept as correct. However, Appellants’ argument fails
when arguing that the disclosed mechanisms differ because one “bases the threshold on the
category of video” while the other “bases the threshold on the perceived content of the video.”
Rather, the disclosed mechanisms differ because each in its totality is functionally and
structurally different. For reasons that escape this panel, Appellants have not included any of
these structural differences in the apparatus claims. Instead, Appellants recite the “threshold
memory which receives a threshol ” which is a common structure to all the differing
mechanisms.

Appellants’ second argument fails on its face. The argument that the decision2 of this
panel ignores elements of Claim 1 1 fails given Appellants own discussion of this panel’s
“intended use” analysis in the decision. Clearly the decision does not ignore the limitation if
that limitation is speciﬁcally discussed. Perhaps Appellants are attempting to argue that the
decision errs in that it should have given more weight to the intended use limitation. While such

an argument would make more sense, we do not see this speciﬁc language in the request before

us. Nor do we see any argument from Appellants of how such an intended use lin1itation
structurally (or flmctionally) changes the apparatus of claim 11.

As was stated in the decision at page 5, “we find the ‘perceived content’ and ‘category’
are the same.” Nothing in Appellants’ request points out a structural limitation in the claims that

distinguishes among the disclosed mechanisms or over the prior art.

Conclusion
In view of the foregoing discussion, we grant Appellants’ request for rehearing to the
extent of reconsidering our decision, but we deny Appellants’ request with respect to making any

change thereto.

ON BRIEF

Before KIMLIN, OWENS and WALTZ, Administrative Patent Judges.

KIMLIN, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests rehearing of our decision of
April 25, 2005, wherein we affirmed the examiner's rejections of

appealed claims 1-18 under 35 U.S.C. § 103. Having reviewed

appellant's request, we are satisfied that our decision is free

of factual and legal error.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2005-0886
Application No. 09/805,313

At the outset, we remain of the opinion that the claim 1
language "for cleaning a surface selected from a group consisting
essentially of dishes . . ." is merely a statement of intended
use that does not serve to structurally distinguish the cleaning
articles of the claimed system from the cleaning articles of
Carter. While appellant maintains that Carter "fails to teach,
or suggest, the claimed use of bath towels for the claimed
cleaning applications" (page 2 of Request, first paragraph), the
claims on appeal are not directed to the use of the cleaning
articles but, rather, the articles themselves with identifying
indicia thereon. Furthermore, although appellant contends that
"[a] towel bearing the 'HIS' indicia that is later used to wash a
wall or a car plainly does not bear indicia specifying 'WALL' or
'CAR'" (page 2 of Request, second paragraph), appellant does not
seem to appreciate that a label can mean different things to
different people. For instance, the "he" and "she" of a
household may well understand that a towel labeled "HIS" is meant
to be used on a car. Manifestly, the mental Choices of a person
regarding the use of a towel cannot patentably distinguish the

structure of one towel from another.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2005-0886
Application No. 09/805,313

Appellant also submits that "[t]he use of a bath towel for
such purposes [cleaning dishes] will ruin the bath towel and
convert it to a rag, which is not the purpose of the towel in
Carter et al." (page 2 of Request, penultimate paragraph).
However, while Carter may be directed to designer towels, we are
convinced that one of ordinary skill in the art would have found
in Carter the suggestion of labeling towels or other cleaning
articles in accordance with an intended use. We simply find
nothing nonobvious in categorizing and organizing articles with
the aid of labels which identify an intended use.

As for the rejection over Scotch—Britem, appellant makes the
argument that "[t]he specification teaches only permanent marking
or actually forming the cleaning article to the indicia
specifying use" (sentence bridging pages 3 and 4 of Request). It
is well settled, however, that limitations in the specification
are not to be read into the claims. As stated at page 6 of our
Decision, "we agree with the examiner that appealed claim 1 is
sufficiently broad to embrace identifying indicia that is removed

from the cleaning article before its use."




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2005-0886
Application No. 09/805,313

In conclusion, based on the foregoing, we have reconsidered
our decision as requested by appellant, but we decline to make
any change therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR
§ l.l36(a)(l)(iv) (effective Sep. 13, 2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 49960

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

The appellants request clarification of our decision (mailed
August 12, 2005). We treat the appellants’ request as a request
for rehearing under 37 CFR § 41.79(2004).

The appellants argue that we were inconsistent in reversing
rejections of claim 12 but not claims 13-15 and 17 that depend
directly or indirectly therefrom, and claims 32-34 but not
claims 36, 38 and 40 that depend indirectly therefrom (request,

pages 1—2).1

claims 35, 37 and 39 which depend directly from, respectively,




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1046
Application No. 09/821,027

We affirmed the rejections of claims 13-15, 17, 36, 38 and 40
because the appellants’ arguments regarding those claims were not
persuasive (decision, pages 10-11 and 13-14). However, as pointed
out by the appellants (request, page 1), those claims depend from
rejected claims. The examiner does not rely upon the additional
references (Chen or van Gogh) applied to those dependent claims for
any disclosure that remedies the deficiency in Chu, Sato and
Tomioka as to the claims from which they depend (answer, pages 10-
16).

Consequently, we modify our decision as follows: The
rejections of claims 11 and 31 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) over Chu,
and claims 11 and 31 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over Sato in view of
Tomioka or Chu, are affirmed. The rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 103
of claims 12, 32-35, 37 and 39 over 1) Chu, and 2) Sato in view of
Tomioka or Chu, claims 13-16, 19-25, 28-30, 36, 38 and 40 over
1) Chu in view of Chen, and 2) Sato in view of Tomioka or Chu,
further in view of Chen, and claims 17 and 18 over 1) Chu in view
of van Gogh and 2) Sato in view of Tomioka or Chu, further in view
of van Gogh, are reversed. Thus, our decision remains affirmed-in-

part.

claims 34, 32 and 33. Claims 35, 37 and 39 stand or fall with
the claims from which they depend (brief, page 7).

Appeal No. 2005-1063
Application No. l0/l26,9l0

ON BRIEF

Before FRANKFORT, NASE, and BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.

FRANKFORT, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to appellant's request for rehearing
of our decision mailed June 24, 2005, wherein we affirmed the
examiner's rejection of claim l under 35 U.S.C. § l03(a) as
being unpatentable over the combined teachings of Jelling (U.S.
3,l8l,773) and Paulsen (U.S. 5,950,818). Claim l is the only
claim pending in the application.

We have carefully considered each of the points of argument
raised by appellant in the request for rehearing, however, those
arguments do not persuade us that we overlooked or misapprehended

any points raised in the appeal, or that our merits based




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1063
Application No. l0/l26,9l0

determination on the patentability of claim l of the present
application is in error.

Appellant's main point of argument appears to be that there is
inadequate teaching, suggestion, or motivation for the combination
of Jelling and Paulsen, because what is disclosed in Paulsen
allegedly leads away from a combination with Jelling. We do not
agree. The issue to be resolved is whether it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
appellant's invention to add serial numbering to the disposable
bags in each of the rolls (50, 52, 54) of Jelling so as to provide
the user of Jelling’s device with a means for ascertaining the
number of bags used and/or remaining on each roll. As noted on
pages 6 and 7 of our earlier decision, from the broad teachings
in Paulsen of providing serial numbering on the bags of the roll
therein “to designate the number of bags used and/or remaining
in said dispenser" (col. l, lines l3—l5), we find adequate
suggestion/motivation to utilize serial numbering on the bags in
Jelling for the purpose of keeping track of the bags used and/or
remaining on each roll. The fact that the number of bags on the
roll in Paulsen is most likely smaller than that in Jelling and
probably does not involve hundreds of bags is, in our opinion,

irrelevant. The advantage to be gained in Jelling from utilizing

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1063
Application No. 10/126,910

a serial numbering scheme as broadly suggested in Paulsen would
have been readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art
and does not appear to depend on the particular number of bags
contained on a roll.

As for appellant's belief that a combination of primary and
secondary references requires not only a suggestion in the latter
for the combination with the former, but also “that the suggestion
requirement be reciprocal" (request, page 1). We know of no such
requirement. In evaluating the propriety of an obviousness
determination it is only necessary to ascertain whether or not
the reference teachings would appear to be sufficient for one of
ordinary skill in the relevant art having the references before him
to make the proposed substitution, combination, or modification.
It is a long—standing premise of patent law that the test for
obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference
may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the primary
reference, nor is it that the claimed invention must be expressly
suggested in any one or all of the references. Rather, the test is
what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested
to those of ordinary skill in the art at the time of appellant's
invention. See, e.g., In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425, 208 USPQ

871, 881 (CCPA 1981).




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1063
Application No. l0/l26,9l0

In this case, we have concluded that the combined teachings of
the applied references would have suggested the subject matter of
claim l on appeal to those of ordinary skill in the art at the
time of appellant's invention.

In light of the foregoing, appellant's request is granted to
the extent of reconsidering our decision mailed June 24, 2005,
but is denied with respect to making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection
with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § l.l36(a).

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to a request, received August 30, 2005
for rehearing of our decision, mailed July l8, 2005, wherein we
sustained each of the section l02 and section l03 rejections
advanced by the examiner.

Our reasons for sustaining these rejections included

rebuttals to the appellants’ several arguments thereagainst

l




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1195

Application No. 09/906,984

including the argument that, “[s]ince the examiner has held that
the claims of the instant application are not patentably distinct
from the claims of the 6,274,291 patent, and these claims have
been held allowable, the claims in the instant application are
allowable" (reply brief, page 1). In rebutting the aforequoted
argument, we stated that “[w]hether similar claims have been
allowed in U.S. Patent No. 6,274,291 is immaterial to the
patentability issue before us," (decision, pages 5-6) citing I_
re Giolito, 530 F.2d 397, 400, 188 USPQ 645, 648 (CCPA 1976). In
these respects, see the paragraph bridging pages 5 and 6 of our
decision. The subject request relates only to the above quoted
argument and our rebuttal thereof. In essence, it is the
appellants’ position in this request that we erred in determining
this argument to be unpersuasive and in relying on Giolito, id;
as support for this determination.

In this latter regard, the appellants attempt to distinguish
their factual circumstance from that of Giolito. For example,
the appellants stress that the claims of Giolito were merely
similar to those in a patent to another. However, even when the
involved claims are the same, it is simply immaterial in ex parte

prosecution that such claims have been previously allowed. See

In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 264, 191 USPQ 90, 97 (CCPA 1976).




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1195

Application No. 09/906,984

Moreover, it is irrelevant that the involved claims are related
to the same or different inventive entities. The statutory tests
for determining patentability simply do not include whether the
same or similar claims have been previously allowed by the Patent
and Trademark Office.

Concerning this point, it is appropriate to here emphasize
that the claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,274,291 were allowed based
on prior art which did not include the NA ‘433 reference or the
1964 IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin applied by the examiner in
the present appeal. Thus, the prior art evidence which
forestalls patentability of the appellants’ claims differs from
the prior art evidence cited in the aforementioned patent. For
this reason, a denial of patentability in the former is not
inconsistent with a grant of patentability in the latter as the
appellants seem to presume.

Finally, it is significant that the appellants have cited no
authority in support of the argument under consideration in their
brief or their reply brief or the instant request for rehearing.
This is not surprising since the argument is based on an
illogical premise, namely, that claims are patentable merely
because they are not patentably distinct from previously allowed

claims. For example, this premise would lead to the illogical




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1195
Application No. 09/906,984
allowance of claims which are so broad as to be not patentably
distinct from narrow patent claims even when the broad claims
encompass prior art subject matter avoided by the narrow patent
claims.

For the above stated reasons, we continue to regard the
argument in question as unpersuasive.

The request for rehearing is denied.

Appeal No. 2005-1384
Application 09/886,200

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, SAADAT, and NAPPI, Administrative Patent Judges.

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

In a paper received by facsimile communication on September
2l, 2005, Appellant requests that we rehear our decision dated
August 23, 2005, wherein we affirmed all rejections of the claims

on appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 103.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1384
Application 09/886,200

We have carefully reviewed our original opinion in light of
appellant's request, but we find no point of law or fact which we
overlooked or misapprehended in arriving at our original
decision. Even in light of appellant's current arguments set
forth in the Request for Rehearing, we find no error in the
analysis or logic set forth in our original opinion.

With respect to appellant's first position under topic A at
page 2 of the request, we reemphasize again our remarks at page 5
of our original opinion which affirmed the examiner's remarks at
page 11 of the answer that appellant effectively was inviting us
to limit the scope of meaning of the term “character set" by
essentially urging us to read disclosed limitations thereof into
the claims on appeal which are not specifically claimed.

Contrary to the belief apparently set forth at the bottom of page
2 of the request, we did not misunderstand the disclosed meaning
of the term “character set”. Nor do we deny appellant's right to
be his own lexicographer. Claims are to be given their broadest
reasonable interpretation during prosecution, and the scope of a
claim cannot be narrowed by reading disclosed limitations into
the claim. ﬁgg In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ 1023,
1027 (Fed. Cir. 1997); In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d
1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989); In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-

05, 162 USPQ 541, 550 (CCPA 1969). “[D]uring patent prosecution




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1384
Application 09/886,200

when claims can be amended, ambiguities should be recognized,
scope and breadth of language explored, and clarification
imposed." In re Zletz, 893 F.2d at 321, 13 USPQ2d at 1322.

Next we treat appellant's urging that Kikuchi and Kobayashi
do not teach or suggest the limitations of claims 8 and 9. We
treated this third stated rejection of claims 7 through 9
rejected under 35 U.S.C. § lO3 over these references at pages ll
through 14 of our prior opinion. In doing so, we expanded upon
the examiner's rationale of combinablitiy and, contrary to the
urging at page 3 of the Request for Rehearing, we did address the
mode change capability in accordance with a number of dots that
are arranged across the width of the lines forming an object
image. A careful reading of the paragraph bridging pages 12 and
13 of our original opinion at least emphasizes this language from
the claims.

Under topic C at page 4 of the Request for Rehearing
appellant urges again that the combination of Kikuchi with Ohsawa
would change the principle of operation of Kikuchi. This first
stated rejection is discussed in detail in our prior opinion at
pages 3 through 9. We simply did not agree with appellant's

initial urging in the brief as to this argument in accordance




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1384
Application 09/886,200

with the discussion in the paragraph of page 7 of our prior
decision. There we considered the argument misplaced to the
extent that appellant urged that the combination of these two
references would have changed the operation of Kikuchi such that
it would be unable to form its intended purpose. We viewed
appellant's argument as arguing the structural combinablitiy of
the references would have lead to the inoperablity of the Kikuchi
reference. We did not and continue not to agree with a basic
urging in appellant's views upon the noted court case at page 4
of the Request for Rehearing that substantial reconstruction and
redesign would be necessary as well as changing the basic
principle of operation. We stated at the bottom of page 6 in a
summary manner that “Plainly, Ohsawa adds a capability to
Kikuchi’s teachings that is not readily recognized within its own
content.” We repeatedly emphasized this in a lengthy discussion
since we considered the teachings of Ohsawa to add to the
teachings of Kikuchi in an advantageously enhancing manner.
The test for obviousness is not whether the features of a

secondary reference may be bodily incorporated into the structure
of a primary reference. It is also not that the claimed

invention must be expressly suggested in any one or all of the




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1384
Application 09/886,200

references. Rather, the test is what the combined teachings of
the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in
the art. In re Keller, 642 F.2d 414, 425, 208 USPQ 871, 881
(CCPA 1981); In re Young, 927 F.2d 588, 591, 18 USPQ2d 1089, 1091
(Fed. Cir. 1991).

Turning to topic D at page 5 of the Request for Rehearing,
the focus of the reasoning here is the examiner's alleged failure
to present a reasonable expectation of success of combining
Kikuchi with the IBM disclosure bulletin. This is not the
rejection the examiner set forth under the second stated
rejection which we discussed at pages 9 through 11 of our prior
decision. We affirmed the rejection alternatively in view of
Kikuchi and Ohsawa or Kikuchi in view of Ohsawa, further in view
of IBM. We considered IBM to be cumulative to what was already
taught in the other two references. Appellant's arguments here
did not question our own analysis on Request for Rehearing but
only that of the examiner. Appellant's urging at page 15 of the
principal brief on appeal makes no mention of Ohsawa as a
reference which is a part of the rejection. Our extensive
analysis from pages 3 through 11 in our prior decision relating

to the combination of Kikuchi and Ohsawa plainly sets forth a




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1384
Application 09/886,200

reasonable expectation of success when combining these two
references. We explained in greater detail at pages 9 through 11
of our prior decision a pertinent feature of both references to
the extent that they related to the argued features of claims l2
and 13 in the second stated rejection.

Lastly, under topic E at pages 5 and 6 of the Request for
Rehearing, appellant wrongly urges again that examiner has not
identified any source of motivation for combining the respective
references. Again, the focus of the arguments is upon the
examiner's alleged deficiencies rather than any argued deficiency
with respect to our reasoning set forth in our prior opinion.
Moreover, when viewed from a motivational perspective, our
analysis in the prior decision greatly emphasizes the
combinablitiy of Kikuchi with Ohsawa and optionally with the IBM
Technical Disclosure Bulletin as well as Kikuchi with Kobayashi
in the respective rejections.

At this point, it also deserves mention as stated at the top
of page 3 of our earlier opinion, that we sustained the three
separately stated rejections of the examiner “for the reasons set
forth by the examiner as embellished upon here.” Contrary to the

view expressed at the bottom of page 6 of the Request for




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 2005-1384
Application 09/886,200

Rehearing, appellant had the opportunity in the form of filing
the brief and a reply brief to respond and assess the strength of
the examiner's rejections. Moreover, a Request for Rehearing
permits appellant to ask for rehearing of our prior decision.
The evidence of unpatentablity of appellant's claims presented on
appeal is based primarily upon the applied prior art and to a
much lesser extent the examiner's arguments.

In view of the forgoing, appellant's Request for Rehearing
is granted the extent that we have in fact reviewed our findings

but is denied as to making any change therein.

RECONSIDERATION

Gilligan et al. (Gilligan) has filed a request for
reconsideration (Paper No. 147) of our Final Decision of
September 22, 1999 (Paper No. 146). Ohsuye et al. (Ohsuye)
has filed an opposition (Paper No. l48) to Gilligan's request
for reconsideration.

Pursuant to 37 CFR § l.658(b), a decision on
reconsideration is limited to a determination of whether any
points were misapprehended or overlooked by a Board panel in
rendering a final decision. We have carefully considered the

arguments advanced in Gilligan's request for reconsideration,

Suntory Limited, Osaka, Japan, a corporation of Japan.

*** PAGE 3 ***


Interference No. 102,700

but we are not convinced that we misapprehended or overlooked
any points in rendering our Final Decision.

According to Gilligan, our decision was based on a
misapprehension that Gilligan "admitted" that its generic
product claims 7l—74 were not enabled by the relevant
specification. This is not correct. A careful perusal of our
decision reveals that we never implied that junior party
Gilligan "admitted" that its generic "PAM" product claims were
nonenabled. What we did say was that the party Gilligan does
not dispute the holding in the Decision on Motions (Paper No.
79) that its generic product claims 71-74 (relating to
purified PAM protein) go beyond the scope of enablement
provided in its specification. In this regard, see pages 3-4
and 7 of our Final Decision. In fact, this was made
abundantly clear by Gilligan on several occasions. For
instance, see Gilligan's Statement of Issues (Paper No. 130-
1/2), and pages 1 and 33 of Gilligan's Brief (Paper No. 138).

In the Decision on Motions (page 5), it was specifically
held that the generic product claims 71-74 are beyond the
scope of enablement provided by Gilligan's involved and parent

application. The holding of nonenablement was premised upon a




*** PAGE 4 ***


Interference No. 102,700

consideration of appropriate factors relevant in determining
whether undue experimentation would be involved in practicing
the full scope of the claimed invention. These factors
include, inter alia, the scope of the working examples, the
breadth of the claims, the nature of the invention, the state
of the prior art, and predictability or unpredictability of
the art, as enumerated in In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737, 8
USPQ2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988) and Ex parte Forman, 230
USPQ 546, 547 (BPAI 1986). Thus, the finding in the Decision
on Motions that Gilligan's generic product claims are not
enabled stands undisputed in this case. This undisputed
finding, and not any admission on the part of Gilligan, was
deemed to be a significant factor in our conclusions regarding
the patentability of Gilligan's generic method claims 76-79,
81-84 and 86-92.

Gilligan also charges us with misapprehending the
significance of statements made by party Gilligan during
prosecution of its parent application 06/655,366 in an
amendment filed on June 6, 1986 (OR 220-235). In relevant
part, Gilligan made the following statements in that

amendment:




*** PAGE 5 ***


Interference No. 102,700

The Office Action also draws the conclusion that
the presence of amidated peptides in a particular
tissue is synonymous with high levels of alpha-
amidating enzyme. This is not true. For example,
rat anterior pituitary tissue contains high alpha-
amidating activity but no known substrates [Eipper
et al., PNAS 80, 5144-5148 (l983)]. Rat posterior
pituitary tissue contains amidated peptides
(oxytocin and vasopressin) but has very little
alpha—amidating activity [Eipper et al., Endo ll6,
2497-2504 (l985)]. Therefore, until individual
tissues are tested for alpha—amidating activity, the
presence or potential levels of the enzyme can not
be anticipated. In fact, Applicants had to screen
large numbers of tumors prior to identifying a tumor
series with high levels of amidating enzyme
activity; many of them were found to be unreliable
or useless as enzyme sources. [OR—23l]

According to Gilligan, the foregoing statement relates to
difficulties encountered in developing the invention prior to
the filing date; and Gilligan insists that those difficulties
dissipated once the purification technique described in
Gilligan's specification was developed. However, as we see
it, Gilligan's statements are tantamount to an admission that
identifying sources of PAM enzyme was unpredictable at the
time the Gilligan application was filed. Gilligan has adduced
no evidence that the identification of particular sources for
the enzyme became more predictable as a result of Gilligan's
development of a purification technique for extracting the

enzyme from an identified source. Rather, by Gilligan's own

5




*** PAGE 6 ***


Interference No. 102,700

admission, there is a need to screen a large number of
potential sources, by species and tissue type, in order to
identify a suitable source of PAM enzyme. Moreover, according
to Gilligan, identification is further complicated by the fact
that detection of the presence of amidated peptides is not a
reliable indicator of the presence of the enzyme being sought.
It is not seen how the development of a particular
purification technique by Gilligan reduces the uncertainties

involved in identifying a suitable source for purification.




*** PAGE 7 ***


Interference No. 102,700

Finally, we note that Gilligan's request for
reconsideration (p. 5) includes a list of potential sources of
PAM enzyme which were mentioned in Gilligan's involved
application or in prior art publications. Gilligan's
application does list a number of publications which
purportedly report the presence of "alpha—amidating enzyme
activity" or "amidated peptides" in a variety of sources.
However, in view of the admitted lack of predictability in the
art, the presence of amidated peptides or some other sign of
alpha—amidating activity is not dispositive with regard to
identification of a useful enzyme source.

For the foregoing reasons, we decline to modify our Final
Decision in any respect.

Decision on Reconsideration

Dance has requested reconsideration and modification
of various aspects of our FINAL DECISION AND JUDGMENT UNDER 37
CFR § 1.658(a), mailed June 20, 2000 (hereinafter, Decision).
Seifert opposes the request in all respects. For the
following reasons, Dance's request for modification of the
Decision is denied in all respects.

A. Dance's alleged diligence and actual reduction to practice

In the Decision at 11-15, we held that Dance's and
Dennis’ declarations and exhibits establish conception of the
subject matter of the count as of October 9, 1989, prior to
Seifert's February 2, 1990, filing date, but fail to prove
diligence during the critical period running from just before
Seifert's filing date (considered to be the date of Seifert's
entry in the field for the purpose of evaluating Dance's
priority case) up to Dance's September 18, 1990, filing date
(Decision at 15-16). As evidence of diligence, Dance relied
on the description in Dance's declaration of the preparation
of a number of documents prepared during the critical period

(Dance Decl. at JR3 17-18, l 10). We held this testimony

3 Junior party Dance's record.

_2_




*** PAGE 3 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

insufficient to prove diligence because "[n]one of these
documents have been introduced into evidence, let alone with
authenticating testimony by someone other than Dance.
Furthermore, the preparation of these documents is not

corroborated by Dennis or anyone else.

(Decision at 17.) Dance argues that

the sequence of acts listed in the Dance
Declaration, since they are nowhere rebutted, must
be taken as established for purposes of this
proceeding. Clearly, to the extent corroboration is
needed, the filing date of the Dance application is
corroborated. Since Seifert in no way challenged
the sufficiency of the assertions of the Dance
Declaration on any basis[,] the Board is asked to
recognize that diligence, to the extent it is
needed, has been established as not having been
objected to or otherwise disproved by Seifert.
[Request at 3.]

This argument places the burden of proof on the wrong party.
It is Dance, as the party seeking to establish a date of
invention prior to Seifert's filing date, who bears the burden
of proving diligence, 37 CFR § l.657(a) and § l.657(b), which
like conception must be corroborated. Brigg v. Symsek, 988
F.2d 1187, 1196, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
Seifert was not required prior to filing his brief to identify

the perceived weaknesses in Dance's priority evidence, with

_3_




*** PAGE 4 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

the exception of objecting under § l.672(c) to its
admissibility‘ if he intended to later move under § l.656(h)
to suppress it on that ground. As Seifert filed no such
motion, he was not required to file a S 1.672(c) objection.
Seifert's contention that Dance's testimony about the

documents cited as proof of diligence lacks

corroboration does not raise an admissibility issue and thus
need not have been noticed by way of an objection under

§ l.672(c). Also, the admissibility of the documents
themselves was never at issue, because they were not included
in Dance's record.

Dance alternatively argues that a showing of
diligence is unnecessary because the drawings which we held
are sufficient to prove conception as of October 9, 1989, are
also sufficient to establish an actual reduction to practice
as of that date in accordance with Dance's preliminary
statement, which asserts that the invention was actually

reduced to practice on or before March 15, 1990 (Request at 2-

4

Admissibility is governed by the Federal Rules of

Evidence, which are made applicable to interference proceedings by
§ l.67l(b).




*** PAGE 5 ***

Decision on Reconsideration

3). Dance's reliance on the preliminary statement is improper
because it is not evidence. 37 CFR § l.629(e). Furthermore,
the contention that the evidence establishes an actual
reduction to practice fails because this evidence does not
establish that (1) prior to Seifert's filing date, Dance
constructed an embodiment that met every element of the
interference count and (2) this embodiment operated for its
intended purpose. Eaton v. Evans, 204 F.3d 1094, 1097,

53 USPQ2d 1696, 1698 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

B. The timeliness of Dance‘: motion to strike the initial
reissue declarations of Seifert, Downey, and shank

At pages 31-33 of the Decision, we held that Dance
has not shown good cause under § 1.645(b) for waiting five and
one—half months after the oral hearing to file the motion to
strike the initial reissue declarations of Seifert, Downey,
and Shank on the ground that they contain inadmissible hearsay
due to absence of a supporting declaration by Seifert's
counsel, Mr. Bookstein. We treated this motion as a motion to
suppress evidence under § 1.656(h), which specifies that such
a motion is due with the moving party's opening brief.

Dance's argument that the motion should be considered timely

because "it was only from and after that October 14, l999[,]

_5_




*** PAGE 6 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

hearing date that it was absolutely clear that no further
declaration from Attorney Bookstein would ever be submitted"
(Motion at 4) was rejected on the ground that "Dance knew as
of the due date for his opening brief, which was subsequent to
the close of Seifert's testimony period, that no Bookstein
declaration had been filed" (Decision at 33). Dance now
argues (Request at 3-4) that
[t]he rules must not be that unambiguous on
the point of when it is absolutely clear
that such a declaration would not be
forthcoming because, as is noted by the
Board on the top of page 31 from Seifert's
brief, apparently with approval[:]
[]No supporting declaration was filed
by Bookstein, although Seifert's brief
for final hearing states that "should
it become necessary or desirable to do
so, such a declaration can and will be
furnished[."]
Our observation that Seifert's brief included an offer to file
a Bookstein declaration was not intended to imply prospective
approval of that offer. This should be apparent from the fact
that the offer was mentioned in the summary of the background
facts of Dance's § 1.633(a) motion for judgment under

35 U.S.C. § 251 (Decision at 28-31) rather than in the

discussion of Dance's motion to strike (id. at 31-36). All of




*** PAGE 7 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

the evidence on which Seifert intends to rely to demonstrate
compliance with 35 U.S.C. § 251 was due with the opposition to
Dance's 37 CFR § 1.633(a) motion. gee Irikura v. Petersen,

18 USPQ2d 1362, 1368 (Ed. Pat. App. & Int. 1990) ("A good
faith effort must be made to submit evidence to support a
preliminary motion or opposition when the evidence is
available. Orikasa v. Oonishi, [10 USPQ2d 1996, 2000 n.12
(Comm'r Pats. & Trademarks 1989)].") Further— more, in Paper
No. 545 (at 12) the Administrative Patent Judge advised the
parties that any new evidence submitted in connection with

previously filed motions "may be submitted with respect to

such motions only upon a showing (§ 1.635) that the evidence
was unavailable when the corresponding motion, opposition or
reply was filed. Such a motion must be filed at least 10 days
prior to the end of that party's relevant testimony period."
As no Bookstein declaration was filed by the end of Seifert's
testimony period (with or without an accompanying § 1.635

motion), Dance's motion to strike was due with his opening

5 "ADDITION OF SEIFERT CLAIM 1; SCHEDULE FOR § l.640(b)
STATEMENTS, TESTIMONY, RECORDS AND BRIEFS," mailed November 15,
1996.




*** PAGE 8 ***


Interference No. l03,379
Decision on Reconsideration

brief, as specified in § l.656(h). This is not altered by the
fact that Seifert's brief, which was filed after Dance's
opening brief, contains the offer to submit a Bookstein
declaration.

C. Dance's jurisdictional argument

At pages 33-35 of the Decision, we rejected Dance's

alternative argument that his belated motion to strike the
initial Seifert, Downey, and Shank reissue declarations should
be considered because "it goes fundamentally to the Patent and
Trademark Office jurisdiction with respect to this
interference. But for the existence of the reissue proceeding
which party Dance has now demonstrated was defectively
granted, the Patent and Trademark Office had no subject matter

jurisdiction to adjudicate this interference." (Motion at 5.)5

Dance does not take issue with our holding that we
have jurisdiction over the interference if it was "properly

declared" under 35 U.S.C. § l35(a), in support of which

5 Although not noted in the Decision, we should point out

that Dance's reasons for making this jurisdictional argument are
unclear; if we lack jurisdiction over this interference, we also

lack the authority to enter judgment against Seifert's reissue
claims for unpatentability under 35 U.S.C. § 251.

Decision on Reconsideration

proposition we cited In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 53 USPQ2d
1769 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and Guinn v. Ko f, 96 F.3d 1419, 40
USPQ2d 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1210
(1997) (Decision at 33). Gartside held that junior party
Forgac's amendment canceling all of his claims involved in the
interference styled as "Forgac v. Gartside" did not divest the
Board of jurisdiction over that interference and thus over
Gartside's involved claims. 203 F.3d at 1316—18, 53 USPQ2d at
1776-78. Likewise, guinn held that Guinn's statutory
disclaimer of his single claim involved in the interference
did not divest the Board of jurisdiction over the interference
and that claim. 96 F.3d at 1421-22, 40 USPQ2d at 1159-60.
Furthermore, as we explained in the Decision at pages 33-
35, the interference was "properly declared" under

§ 135(a) in accordance with Perkins v. Kwon, 886 F.2d 325,

327 & n.2, 12 USPQ2d 1308, 1309-10 & n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1989),
because (1) Seifert's reissue application was a "pending
application" under 37 CFR § l.601(i) at the time the
declaration notice was mailed and (2) the examiner, prior to
declaration of the interference, had determined that Seifert's

now involved




*** PAGE 10 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

reissue application claims 31-35 are allowable. Dance has not
explained why the interference was not "properly declared" in
accordance with Perkins and why Seifert's alleged failure to
comply with 35 U.S.C. § 251, if proved (it has not been),
should lead to a different result on the jurisdiction issue
than was reached in Gartside and Guinn.7

For the foregoing reasons, we remain of the view
that Seifert's failure to comply with the requirements of 35
U.S.C. § 251, if proved, would result in the entry of judgment
against Seifert's reissue claims for unpatentability on that
ground rather than a holding that we lack subject matter
jurisdiction over the interference.
D. Dance's "new matter" argument

At pages 40-47 of the Decision, we rejected Dance's
argument that the omission from Seifert's reissue claims of
the extension wire limitations recited in the original patent
claims constitutes "new matter" in contravention of the 35

U.S.C. § 251 (Dance's opening brief at 15). We treated this

7 See also Gustavsson v. Valentini, 25 USPQ2d 1401, 1406-07
(Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991), wherein the Board rejected
Gustavsson's argument that Valentini's admitted failure to comply
with 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) rendered the interference void ab initio.

_lO_

"new matter" argument as based on the requirement of § 251

that the reissue

claims be directed to "the invention disclosed in the original
patent" and, citing Hester Indus. Inc. v. Stein Inc., 142 F.3d
1472, 1484, 46 USPQ2d 1641, 1651 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied,
525 U.S. 947 (1998), noted that this inquiry is analogous to
the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, first
paragraph (Decision at 40). After analyzing the facts in the
present case in accordance with the principles set forth in
Gentry Gallery, Inc. v. Berkline Corp., 134 F.3d 1473,

45 USPQ2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 1998), which held that the
disclosure of Gentry's patent (i.e., Sproule patent No.
5,062,244) did not provide § 112, first paragraph, written
description support for the broadened amended claim, we
concluded that Seifert's original disclosure provides written
description support for Seifert's broadened reissue claims.
Dance argues that our decision is incorrect because it ignores
U.S. Indus. Chems. Co. v. Carbide & Carbon Chems. Corp., 315
U.S. 668, 678 (1941); Russell v. Dodge, 93 U.S. 460, 463

(1876); Pattee Plow Co. v. Kingman, 129 U.S. 294, 299 (1888);

Decision on Reconsideration

and Ballew v. Watson, 129 USPQ 48, 49-50 (D.C. Cir 1961),
cited in Dance's opening brief at 16, which are characterized
in Dance's request for reconsideration (at 5) as "stand[ing]
for the principle that removal of language from the

specification [sic, claims] introduces ‘new matter’ and is

contrary to the reissue statute." This is not a fair
characterization of the holdings in these cases, which we
understand to mean that reissue claims may not be broadened to
omit features described as essential in the original patent.
For example, while Dance's opening brief (at 16) correctly
quotes U.S. Indus., the most recent of the cited Supreme Court
cases, as stating that

[t]his court has uniformly held that the

omission from a reissue patent of one of

the steps or elements prescribed in the

original, thus broadening the claims to

cover a new and different combination,

renders the reissue void, even though the

result attained is the same as that brought

about by following the process claimed in

the original patent.
(emphasis added) 315 U.S. at 678, the phrase "prescribed in

the original" must be read in conjunction with the Court's

holding that "[w]e think it plain that the reissue omitted a




*** PAGE 13 ***


Interference No. lO3,379
Decision on Reconsideration

step in the process which was described and claimed as
essential in the original patent." 315 U.S. at 677.“
Likewise, in Ballew the District of Columbia Court of Appeals

held that "we have no basis

for characterizing as clearly erroneous the finding of the
District Court that the claims in the reissue application
omitted essential elements of the original patent and were
drawn to an invention different from that intended to be
secured by the original patent." 129 USPQ at 50. For the
reasons given in the Decision at pages 40-47, we remain of the
view that the artisan would not have understood the extension
wire feature to be an essential part of Seifert's invention.
E. Dance's "recapture rule" argument

Dance contends our conclusion (Decision at 49) that
Seifert made no argument during prosecution which amounts to a

surrender of the invention recited in the reissue claims,

3 We should also point out that in contrast to current
35 U.S.C. § 251, which requires that the reissue claims be "for
the invention disclosed in the original patent," the reissue

statute involved in U,S. Indua., i.e., 35 U.S.C. § 46, required
that the reissue claims be for the "same invention." Hester,

142 F.2d at 1485, 46 USPQ2d at 1651; Ig zg Amos, 953 F.2d 613, 619
n.2, 21 USPQ2d 1271, 1275 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

_ 13 _




*** PAGE 14 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

Hester at 1481, 46 USPQ2d at 1648, is erroneous because
"Seifert made three very strident arguments in its Amendment
dated February 4, 1991 which distinguish [the claims from] the
prior art based upon the required presence of the Extension
Wire Structure" (Request at 6). We do not agree that the
arguments made in that amendment, which were discussed at
pages 49-50 of the Decision (wherein it was identified as the

amendment received February 19,




*** PAGE 15 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

1991), can fairly be characterized as strident arguments based
on the extension wire limitations.
For the foregoing reasons, Dance's request for

modification of our Decision is DENIED.

Before HAIRSTON, KRASS and LEE, Administrative Patent Judges.
LEE, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION

On April 15, 1998, we rendered a decision sustaining the
rejection of claims 6-8 and reversing the rejection of claim

9. The appellants have filed a request for reconsideration

1 Application for patent filed June 24, l993. According to appellants,

this application is a continuation of Application No. 07/554,603, filed July

07/369,567, filed June 21, l989, now abandoned.

l




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 95-0665
Application 08/082,326

(Paper No. 28), contending that claims 6-8 are patentable over
art.

In the request for reconsideration, the appellants point
out
that in column 26, lines 36-40 of Frieder, the reference to
granting access to the main store on a "fixed priority basis"
does not contemplate interrupting an already commenced but yet
unfinished memory access to accommodate a higher priority
memory access. The appellants refer to column 27, lines 31-49
of Frieder and state that once access to memory is granted
based on the fixed priority scheme, the access is completely
performed before the arbitration circuit is released for
granting the next access to memory.

The appellants have, evidently, misinterpreted our
opinion. We did not express the view that Frieder itself
discloses having a high priority memory access interrupt a low
priority memory access in mid—stream. Apparently, as pointed
out by the appellants, it does not. The rejection is one for
obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103, not for anticipation under
35 U.S.C.

§ 102.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 95-0665
Application 08/082,326

Frieder discloses that access to memory by the various
processors including execution and auxiliary processors are
granted on a "fixed priority basis". That would have
reasonably informed one with ordinary skill in the art that
some processors are higher ranked in priority as far as a
memory access is concerned. In our initial decision, we noted
that the concept of
an interrupt is not foreign in Frieder and pointed out that
Frieder specifically discloses interrupting an auxiliary
processor's activities when an execution processor needs the
services of the auxiliary processor. We then concluded that
it would have been prima facie obvious to one with ordinary
skill in the art that the memory access of a less privileged
processor can get interrupted by the memory access request of
a higher privileged processor and thus not get completed until
later. With an appreciation for interrupts, one with ordinary
skill in the art would have readily recognized that it is not
necessary that something not yet finished be allowed to
continue to the end if a higher priority activity is pending.
Nothing in the request for reconsideration persuades us that

our conclusion is incorrect.




*** PAGE 4 ***

It should be noted that teachings from a reference are
not limited to the preferred embodiments or the specific
working examples in the reference. In re Burckel, 592 F.2d
1175, 1179, 201 USPQ 67, 70 (CCPA 1979); In re Bode, 550 F.2d
656, 661, 193 USPQ 12, 17 (CCPA 1977); In re Snow, 471 F.2d
1400, 1403, 176 USPQ 328, 329 (CCPA 1973). A reference is
good not just for
what it expressly teaches but also for what it would have
reasonably suggested to one with ordinary skill in the art.

In re Lamberti, 545 F.2d 747, 750, 192 USPQ 278, 280 (CCPA
1976).

The appellants make other arguments specifically
addressing how the various registers means identified by the
examiner in the examiner's answer on page 5 do not satisfy the
claimed register means for each processor. However, because
the examiner's position is explained in the examiner's answer,
the place for presenting arguments against it is in the reply
brief. The appellants may not raise these arguments for the
first time in a request for reconsideration. Accordingly,
these arguments are not considered.

QN REQUEST FQR REHEARING
Appellant requests reconsideration of our decision dated
August 24, 1999, in the above—identified appeal. According to
appellant, the request for reconsideration is a request for
clarification of that decision. The request for

reconsideration is QRANTED.

*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 95-2687
Application No. 08/105,984

Specifically, appellant "believes that the Board's
decision leaves claims 9-12 of the application in a non-
rejected status.” Appellant requests confirmation of the

status of claims 9-12.

The decision on appeal mailed August 24, 1999, states

(Paper No. 13, page 9) :

The rejection of claims 1, 3-8 and 13-15 under
35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph, as lacking

descriptive support in the application, as
originally filed, is AFFIRMED. The rejection of
claims 1 and 3-15 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second
paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to
particularly point out and distinctly claim the
subject matter which applicants regard as the

invention is REVERSED.

Therefore, based on the record before us, claims 9-12 do
not currently stand rejected under any section of Title 35 of

the United States Code.

Appeal No. 95-4452
Application 08/094,925

This is a decision on rehearing of our original decision
of November 17, 1998, wherein we reversed rejections of the
claims on appeal under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103 and instituted
a rejection of all claims on appeal under the second paragraph
of 35 U.S.C. § 112. Appellants‘ request for reconsideration
of January 19, 1999 is therefore considered a request for
rehearing of that rejection.

Appellants only specifically request reconsideration of
our rejection of claims 14 through 16. In light of the
positions set forth in this request for rehearing, including
appellants‘ correlation of the subject matter of claims 14
through 16 to the disclosed invention, the rejection is hereby
withdrawn only as to these claims. As such, we hereby remand
this application for the examiner's consideration of whether
or not to institute new art rejections of claims 14 through 16
on the same, additional or different prior art in accordance
with our discussion set forth in the middle of page 6 of our
original opinion.

Inasmuch as appellants’ request for rehearing does not
ask for a rehearing or reconsideration of our rejection of
claims 2 through 9 and 11, appellants have therefore impliedly

Appeal No. 95-4513
Application O8/261,667

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request that we reconsider our decision mailed

OI]

September 25, 1998 wherein we affirmed the rejection of claims
1-6 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over Koboshi.

Appellants argue (request, page 1) that they find in the
record no concession that “[t]here is no dispute as to whether
Koboshi discloses developing step (a) in appellants’ claim 1"
as stated on page 4 of our decision. Appellants did not argue
in their briefs that Koboshi does not disclose step (a) of
their claim 1 and do not make that argument in their request
for rehearing.

Appellants argue that Koboshi teaches that image
amplification should not be used with a bleaching step
(request, page 1). In support of this argument, appellants
rely upon the portion of Koboshi which states: “To wit, the
inventors have found that the bleaching of silver with
hydrogen peroxide can not take place within the region in

which the image is amplified, and that it can only take place




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 95-4513
Application O8/261,667

by using the above—mentioned bath which is so adjusted in a
region which is different than the above—mentioned region in
which the image is amplified" (col. 3, lines 62-68). The
compounds which Koboshi adds to the bath to carry out this
adjustment, appellants argue, would materially affect the

basic and novel characteristics of appellants’ method

and therefore are excluded by the term “consisting essentially
of" in step (b) of appellants’ claim 1 (request, pages l—2).
Appellants have not stated on the record what they
consider to be the basic and novel characteristics of their
method. Our decision (page 5) includes a finding as to what
the basic and novel characteristics of appellants’ claimed
method are, and in appellants’ request for rehearing, they do
not contest this finding. We remain of the view that for the
reasons given in our decision (pages 5-6), the compounds which
Koboshi adds to his bath would not materially affect the basic
and novel characteristics of appellants’ claimed method.
Appellants argue that their method has the advantage of
permitting the use of a common storage facility for hydrogen

peroxide used in the amplification solution and the bleaching

Appeal No. 95-4513
Application O8/261,667

solution (request, page 2). As stated in our decision (page
5), the hydrogen peroxide used in Koboshi’s bleaching solution
could be stored in the same container as hydrogen peroxide
used in an amplification solution.

Appellants argue that in our decision, we focused only on
step (b) of their method (request, page 2). As discussed
above, appellants have not argued that Koboshi does not
disclose step (a) of their method.

We have considered appellants’ request for rehearing but,
for the reasons given above, decline to make any change to our
decision.

Ex parte RICHARD W. HARRISON
and JOHN F. SCARZELLO

Appeal No. 95-4662
Application 08/048,101‘

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, FLEMING and CARMICHAEL, Administrative Patent Judges.

CARMICHAEL, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
This is a decision on a request for rehearing filed July 23, 1998 (Paper No. 26),
of our Decision dated July 14, 1998 (Paper No. 25). Appellants argue that: (1) our
decision is confusingly characterized as an amplification of the examiner's reasons

whereas in fact the opinion is inconsistent with the examiner's reasoning and presents

1 Application for patent filed April 16, 1993.
1




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 95-4662
Application 08/048,101

a new ground of rejection; and (2) claim 10 requires that transmitted signals be limited
to radiation emitted within and propagated through the water.
( 1) Consistency with the examiner's reasoning

Our decision began by saying “[w]e affirm for the reasons given by the examiner,
amplified as follows." Decision at 2. By the phrase “[w]e affirm for the reasons given

by the examiner" we meant that we agree with the examiner's rationale as stated in

the examiner's Answer. We adhere to that view. That is, we still agree that the
combination of teachings from multiple references as explained by the examiner would
have rendered the claimed subject matter obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.

By the phrase “amplified as follows" we meant that affirmance of the examiner's
rejection was further supported as set forth in the Decision. In particular, we found that
“the subject matter of claim 10 would have been obvious from Kirkland, with or without
the additional references cited." Decision at 4. This is consistent with the examinefs
rationale which states:

Appellants argue that the prior art differs from the present invention in that the

prior art transmits electromagnetic energy through air as well as through a body of

electrically conductive liquid, e. g. sea water. Namely it is argued that the primary

references to Kirkland (‘822) and to Shostak (‘520) show transmission of
electromayietic energy through air and sea water. Examiner is in agreement with

this point but fails to see how the present claim language precludes the prior art

rendering it obvious. The references do show transmission of electromagnetic

energy into sea water for the purpose of detecting a submerged object. This is the
teaching relied upon.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 95-4662
Application 08/048, 101

Exarniner’s Answer at 4, lines 2-12. We are in harmony with the exarniner’s position that
although Kirkland shows some transmission through air and some through water, the present
claim language does not preclude obviousness since Kirkland shows transmission via sea water as
claimed.

Relying on Kirkland alone does not constitute a new ground of rejection. In afﬁrming a
multiple reference rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103, the Board may rely on one of the one
references alone in an obviousness rationale without designating it as a new ground of rejection.
In re Bush, 296 F.2d 491, 496, 131 USPQ 263, 266-67 (CCPA 1961); In re Boyer, 363 F.2d
455, 458 n.2, 150 USPQ 441, 444 n.2 (CCPA 1966). Thus, our decision did not include a new
ground of rejection.

(2) Scope of Claim 10

Appellants argue in their Request that claim 10 requires that transmitted signals be limited
to radiation emitted within and propagated through the water. We disagree.

Claims undergoing examination are given their broadest reasonable interpretation
consistent with the speciﬁcation. In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1194, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1850

(Fed. Cir. 1994) (in banc).




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 95-4662
Application 08/048,101

In the present case, Claim 10 recites processing means “for comparing differences in
analyses of the transmitted signals.” Appellant’s argument proceeds as if the recited ﬁmction
were comparing differences in only the water—transn1itted signals. Request at 2. However, Claim
10 is not limited to using only the water—transn1itted signals. Claim 10 broadly refers to
differences in “analyses” of the water—transmitted signals. The “analyses” are not necessarily
informed only by the water—transmitted signals.

Kirkland discloses the same means as Appellants for performing the recited function of
“comparing differences in analyses of the transmitted signals.” Kirkland’s processing means
compares differences in analyses of signals transmitted from transmitter T through water W to
receiver R at different times. Column 4, lines 29-40. Kirkland’s analyses of the water—transn1itted
signals involve the phase relationship between the water—transn1itted signals and the air-
transmitted signals, but such analysis is not precluded by the claims on appeal.

CONCLUSION
We have thoroughly reconsidered the appeal in light of the entire record including the

present Request. The modiﬁcation sought by Appellants is denied.

REQQEST FOR REQQNSIDERATIQN
Appellant requests reconsideration of our decision of
April 30, 1997, wherein we affirmed the examiner's rejection of

the appealed claims under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

1 Application for patent filed November 18, 1992.

According to appellant, this application is a division of
Application 07/725,376, filed June 27, 1991, now abandoned; which
is a continuation of Application No. 07/542,180, June 22, 1990,

*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 96-0979
Application No. 07/979,552

Appellant takes issue with our statement in the decision
that ”[a]ppellant‘s specification imparts no specific structure
to the frame.” (Emphasis added.) Appellant responds that the
specification describes the frame as "being generally rectangular
and having a generally rectangular central opening” (page 1 of
Request). However, appellant's argument makes our point
precisely, yigp, a generally rectangular shape and opening does
not amount to a specific structure. Also, it is not apparent to
us, as urged in the Request, that frame 11 of specification
Figure 1 has a relatively massive body. Furthermore, it is by
now well settled that claim language is to be given its broadest
reasonable interpretation during prosecution and that specific
limitations found in the specification are not to be read into
the claims.

Appellant's argument regarding the step of testing the chip
for proper electrical operation before installing a heatsink has
been adequately addressed in the original decision.

We have reconsidered our decision, as requested by
appellant, but we fail to find any error therein. Accordingly,
appellant's request is denied with respect to making any change

in our decision.

Judges.

JEFFREY T. SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants have ﬁled a paper under 37 CFR § 1.197(b) requesting that we
reconsider our decision of May 31, 2001, wherein we affirmed the rejection of

claims 1, 3-10 and 12-22 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1996-1132
Application 08/217,752

37 CFR § l.l97(b) provides as follows:

Appellant may ﬁle a single request for rehearing within two months
from the date of the original decision, unless the original decision is so
modiﬁed by the decision on rehearing as to become, in effect, a new
decision, and the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences so states.
The request for rehearing must state with particularity the points
believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the
decision and also state all other grounds upon which rehearing is
sought. See § l.l36(b) for extensions of time for seeking rehearing in
a patent application and § l.550(c) for extensions of time for seeking
rehearing in a reexamination proceeding.

Appellants assert that the Board has overlooked and/or misconstrued
limitations appearing in claim 1. Specifically Appellants state:
[C]laim 1 according to the present invention requires, inter alia:

(iii) withdrawing azine final product thus formed from
said circulating reaction medium to maintain the volume
thereof essentially constant,

(iv) heating said circulating reaction medium to a
temperature of at least 130°C...

Thus, as set forth above, the process of the presently claimed
invention requires the step of withdrawing azine final product from the
reaction medium (step iii) an_<l heating said circulating medium (which
does not include the azine reaction product, which was removed in
step (iii)) to a temperature of at least 130°C (step (iv)). Appellants
respectfully submit that neither the grounds for rejection nor the
Decision rendered May 31, 2001 fully account for these requirements.
[Rehearing Request, p. 2]




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1996-1132
Application 08/217,752

We cannot agree. Claim 1 does not require that step (iii) occur before and
separate from step (iv) as the Appellants seem to think. In re Morris, 127 F.3d
1048, 1056, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“It is the applicants’ burden
to precisely define the invention, not the PTO’s.”). Appealed claim 1 does not
require the azine product to be removed from the circulating reaction medium prior
to heating to a temperature of at least 130°C. Claim 1 also does not require the
circulating reaction medium to be devoid of azine when heated to a temperature of
at least 130°C. According to the specification, page 9, the azine can be removed by
a distillation process. The speciﬁcation, page 10, also discloses distillation is
suitable for removing water from the circulating reaction medium. Unless the steps
of a method actually recite an order, the steps are not ordinarily construed to require
a particular order. Interactive Giﬂ Express, Inc. v. Campuserve, Inc., 256 F .3d
1323, 1342, 59 USPQ2d 1401, 1416 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding no order required).
The present record does not indicate that azine is not be removed while the heating
circulating reaction medium.

In summary, we have reconsidered our decision in light of all of the

arguments made in the appellants’ request. However, we see no compelling reason

justifying a different result. Accordingly, we decline to modify our original
decision.

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request that we reconsider our decision mailed
on February 3, 2000 wherein we affirmed the rejection of
claims 8-14 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over Schulz, Donnelly,
Thomas or Wells, each taken alone or in view of Nystrand.

Appellants argue that 1) not all of the claimed features
are taught in the prior art and, therefore, optimization
cannot provide for obviousness of each of the claimed
features, 2) Schulz teaches only a tip—to—tip assembly having

a single pattern of deep and shallow bosses, and does not




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1996-3589

provide a teaching regarding the height of the bosses or
recognize a criticality as to boss density, distribution or
dual patterns, and 3) Nystrand uses a different density
combination than that claimed and does not recognize a height
for two separate embossing patterns as being different.

Appellants, however, do not address the discussion in our
opinion regarding how Schulz and Nystrand apply to appellants’
claims, and present a specific argument as to why appellants
consider our analysis to be incorrect. Consequently, we are
not convinced of error in our decision.

We have reconsidered our decision but, for the reason
given above, decline to make any change thereto.

Appellants argue that the Board has not correctly
interpreted the feature of claim 13, namely, “a data base dump
facility coupled to said transaction processing system for
storing said data base in respgnge tg a filling Qf said audit
trail storage area.” (Emphasis added). Appellants assert that
the misinterpretation of this feature and the resulting finding
that “an artisan, looking at APA, would have found it obvious to
dump the contents of the audit trail storage area 24 into the
dump tapes 50 in response to when said storage 24 gets filled up,
instead of doing the dumping periodically” is not dispositive of
claim 13. [Request for Rehearing, pages 2 and 3]. Appellants
argue that this is grounds for reversing our decision with
respect to claim 13.

We have reviewed our decision of September 17, 1999 in light
of Appellants‘ arguments in the request for rehearing. We agree
with Appellants that the above finding in regard to claim 13 is
erroneous. We, therefore, reverse our prior decision as to claim
13 for the reasons which follow.

We agree with Appellants that APA does not show or suggest
the dumping of the data base from storage areas (16, 18, 20 and
22) in response to any condition of the audit trail storage area

(24), much less the filling of the audit trail storage area as

said storage areas onto the dump tapes 50 is done periodically
[specification, page 9] not in response to a filling of the audit
trail storage area as claimed or any other condition relating to
the audit trail storage area.
We, therefore, reverse our decision of September 17, l999

being unpatent—able over Cline in view of Hampl and (2) Claims
9-11 as being unpatentable over Cline in view of Hampl and
Montoya. We have carefully reconsidered our decision in light
of the arguments advanced; however, we decline to alter our
decision in any respect.
The appellants note that on page 6 of our decision we

quoted column 2, lines 39-43, of Cline wherein it is stated
that:

The magnesium oxide may be used as the sole filler

for the paper or it may be used in combination with

the other conventional fillers such as calcium

carbonate provided at least l5% by weight of the

wrapper is magnesium oxide. [Emphasis added.]
The appellants on page 3 of the request thereafter state that
(l) “[t]his one statement in Cline, taken independently from
the remainder of the reference, may appear to the Board to

teach what the Board alleges” and (2) “if the Board actually
had considered the reference as a whole, they would have noted
in the paragraph directly after this statement . . . that
Cline contradicts the Board's interpretation.” In support of
this position the appellants reference column 2, line 65,

through column 3, line 20, of Cline wherein it is stated:




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 97-0292
Application O7/814,779

Neither magnesium oxide nor the chemical

adjuvant salts when used alone as a filler or

coating in smoking article wrappers substantially

reduce visible sidestream smoke. . . . The amounts

of magnesium oxide and chemical adjuvant employed in

the wrapper are critical and it has been found that

amounts of magnesium oxide less than l5% and of

chemical adjuvant salt of less than 0.5% by weight

are ineffective in combination to achieve the

desired reduction in visible sidestream smoke.

Preferably and for maximum sidestream smoke

reductions, the wrapper should contain at least 35%

magnesium oxide and at least 2.0% of the chemical

adjuvant salt.

We must point out, however, the fact that Cline subse-
quently states that (l) magnesium oxide when used alone does
not “substantially reduce” visible sidestream smoke and (2)
“preferably” the wrapper should contain at least 35% magnesium
oxide, does not “contradict” what has previously been stated
in lines 39-43 of column 2 as the appellants allege. While,
of course, that portion of Cline noted by the appellants
indicates that magnesium oxide when used alone is ineffective
or unsatisfactory and that the “preferred” embodiment is one
which contains at least 35% magnesium oxide, all of the
teachings of a particular reference must be evaluated for what

they fairly teach one of ordinary skill in the art, including

those teachings that are “phrased in terms of a nonjpreferred

embodiment or as being unsatisfactory for the intended
purpose” (emphasis ours). In re Boe, 355 F.2d 961, 965, 148

USPQ 507, 510 (CCPA 1966). We also observe that what Cline
considers “ineffective” vis—a—vis what the appellants consider
“ineffective” is not clear.

Moreover, we did not simply rely on lines 39-43 of column
2 of Cline as the appellants imply. In our decision we also
made note of the fact that in Cline:

the first line of the Abstract and column 2, lines
17-27, state that the invention is for a wrapper
having “at least 15% by weight magnesium oxide in
combination with at least 0.5% by weight of a
specific chemical adjuvant," without making any
mention whatsoever of “other convention fillers”
being used. Equally significant is the fact that in
independent claim 1 Cline sets forth that the
wrapper contains “at least 15% magnesium oxide and
at least 0.5% of a chemical adjuvant salt,” without
setting forth that the wrapper contains “other
conventional fillers.” [Page 6.]

The appellants also urge that they are the “ones” skilled
in the art and imply that, as such, their interpretation of
Cline should be dispositive. However, as the court stated in
In re Vamco Mach. & Tool, Inc., 752 F.2d 1564, 1575, 24 USPQ2d
617, 623 (Fed. Cir. 1985): “We too can read this patent and

understand what it describes.”




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 97-0292
Application O7/814,779

The appellants also note that “there is no clear teaching
in the examples of Cline utilizing l5% sole total filler or

anything remotely close” (request, page 3) and contend that

the “examples in Cline, however, have been wholly overlooked
by the Board" (request, page 4). While it is true that there
is no specific example in Cline of utilizing l5% sole total

filler, a reference

must be evaluated for all it teaches and is not limited to its

specific examples. In re Snow, 471 F.2d l400, l403, l76 USPQ

328, 329 (CCPA 1973).

The appellants’ request is granted to the extent of
reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to
making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

§ l.l36(a).

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request rehearing of our decision entered
September 3, l999.

We have reconsidered our decision in light of Appellants‘
arguments, but are not persuaded of any errors therein.
Therefore, we decline to make any changes in our prior
decision.

OPINION

Appellants argue that we overlooked or misapprehended
limitation d) of claims l and ll in sustaining the
anticipation rejection of claims 1 and ll over Davis. In
particular, Appellants argue that Davis does not teach
"determining if said second object is present on said user
interface . . .," as provided by limitation d). We stand by
our decision.

We interpreted the terms "object" and "location," as
applied to claim l, as follows (Decision, page 4):

In terms of claim l, a particular field (e.g., "alpha l,"

"beta l," etc.) in a category (e.g., category

"Outline/first") is an "object" and the category itself

(e.g., category "Outline/first" or "Outline/second") is

also an "object." Thus, going from field "alpha l" to

"beta l" in category "Outline/first" is a move from a

first object to a second object. Also, going from field

"alpha l" in category "Outline/first," shown in figure

_2_




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-1274
Application O8/431,397

5h, to field "alpha 2" in category "Outline/second" in
figure Si is a move from a first object (either field
"alpha 1" or category "Outline/first") to a second object
(either field "alpha 2" or category "Outline/second")
The "location" in the "object" is the position of the
cursor in the Edit window, e.g., the cursor (unnumbered)
in Edit Window 264 in figure 5i can be considered a
"second location" in a "second object." The Edit Window
is associated with the particular field (i.e., object) in
a particular category (also an object).

We addressed limitation d) as follows (Decision,
pages 9-10):

Nevertheless, we find that Davis discloses
limitations d) and e) for the reasons discussed with
respect to limitation c). Eirst, hitting the TAB key to
move from one field to another is "receiving an input
from said user to move said cursor to a next location" as
recited in limitation c) and the system brings the next
field (the second object) to the user interface and
provides the cursor at the second location in the Edit
Window. This is basically the same as the admitted prior
art except that only one field appears on the screen in
Davis at a time. The user may enter data as recited in
limitation e). Second, selecting the "next category"
from the menu in figure 5h is "receiving an input from
said user to move said cursor to a next location" as
recited in limitation c) and the system brings the next
category (the second object) to the user interface and
provides the cursor at the second location as shown in

figure 5i. The user may enter data as recited in
limitation e)."

The screens shown in figure 5 of Davis are specific
examples of the "FORMS" objects in figure 3a. Each category
under "FORMS" is an object as indicated by the fact that it
has a separate block in figure 3a and each category (object)

_3_




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. l997—l274
Application O8/431,397

is separately displayed on the user interface; e.g., figure 5g
shows the object category "Outline/first" and figure 5i shows
the object category "Outline/second." Each "FORMS" category
(object) has one or more "field" objects, e.g., Category 1 in
figure 3a has "!field l" and "field 2," where the data field
is indicated by rectangles next to the field names. In Davis,
a category has all its fields displayed on the user interface,
e.g., "Outline/first" in figure 5g has fields "alpha l,"

"beta l," "gamma l," and "!omega" all on the user interface.
Although we believe that one of ordinary skill in the art
would have recognized that if the list of fields (objects) was
longer, the system could scroll the field pointer 266 down the
list to fields (objects) which are not currently shown on the
interface and, thus, bring such fields (objects) to the user
interface, just as a user scrolls through a document in a word
processing program, such a finding is not part of the
rejection. When a FORM is filled out with specific
information it becomes one of the RECORDS in figure 3a.

When the TAB key is pressed to go to from a first field

(object) to a second field (object) within a category

(object), e.g., from field (object) "alpha l" to field




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. l997—l274
Application O8/431,397

(object) "beta l," the system determines that the second field
(object) is present on the user interface and data may be
entered within the edit window at a second location for the
second field (object). The system "determines if said second
object is present on said user interface" because it
interprets the TAB key as a command to go to the next field
(second object) on the user interface in the same way as
admitted prior art systems (specification, page 1) interpret
the TAB key as a determination that the next field is on the
user interface. Claim l does not define how the system
determines if the object is present on the user interface, so
recognition of the TAB key is one method of determining.
Claim l says nothing about skipping fields (objects) or
changing the order of appearance of fields (objects).

When the "next category" is selected from the menu, the
system determines that the second category (object) is not
present on the user interface and brings the second category
(object) to the user interface, e.g., bringing up the user
interface for the next category shown in figure 5i.

Appellants argue that hitting the TAB key or selecting

the "next category" from the menu is not the same as




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1997-1274

Application O8/431,397

"determining if said second object is present on said user
interface . . ." because (Req. for Reh'g, page 2):

Davis has no need to determine if the second object
is present on the user interface. This is because the
data is always entered into the same window 264. A field
pointer 266 determines which field is enabled for data
entry (column 12, lines 20-34) in the window 264. There
is no need for Davis to determine if the second object
(for example, a second field) is present on the user
interface because the window is already displayed.

We disagree with these arguments. Davis determines that
the next field (object) is present on the user interface in
response to pressing a TAB key in the same way as the admitted
prior art (specification, page 1) and determines that the next
category (object) is not present on the user interface in
response to a selection of the "next category" item from the
menu. Appellants have not explained, for example, why, when
there are multiple fields displayed on the user interface as
in Appellants‘ figure 2, pressing a TAB key in the admitted
prior art (specification, page 1) does not involve a
determination by the system that the next field is on the user
interface and why Davis does not involve this same
determination.

The argument that Davis has no need to determine if the

second object is present on the user interface because the

_6_




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1997-1274

Application 08/431,397

window is already displayed is unpersuasive. The Edit Window
264 is just a wordprocessing window for entering data into the
object; it is not the object itself. Instead of a separate
line for each field (object) as for fields 0, 1, and 7 in
Appellants‘ figure 2, Davis uses a pointer 266 to indicate the
field and a single edit window because the data length may be
extensive. Claim 1 does not specify how the objects or
locations appear on the user interface and does not define
over Davis. The edit window's presence in Davis does not
eliminate the need to determine if the second object is
present on the user interface. The system in Davis determines
that the next object is on the user interface if the TAB key
is pressed (i.e., that it is one of the fields for a
particular category) and determines that the next object is
not on the interface if the "next category“ is selected from
the menu. The location of the cursor in the edit window for a
first object (say "alpha 1") is a first location and the
location of the cursor in the edit window for the second
object (say "beta 1") is a second location although the cursor

may have the same physical location on the screen.




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. l997—l274
Application O8/431,397

For the reasons stated above, Appellants have not

persuaded us that we erred in our finding of anticipation.
CONCLUSION

We have considered Appellants‘ request to the extent that
we have reconsidered our decision of September 3, 1999, but we
decline to make any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request reconsideration of our decision of
November 8, 1999, wherein we reversed the examiner's rejection
of claims 18-28 under 35 U.S.C. § 103, and affirmed the
examiner's rejection of claims 27-30 under 35 U.S.C. § 112,
first paragraph. Appellants make no argument regarding our

_]__




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1997-1390
Application No. 08/485,199

affirmance of claims 27 and 28 under § 112, first paragraph,
but request that we reconsider our decision with respect to
the affirmance of claims 29 and 30 under § 112, first
paragraph.

Appellants acknowledge our finding in the decision that
"there is simply no description of a conductive layer that is
horizontally oriented on an annealed edge” (sentence bridging
pages 4 and 5 of Decision), but submit that because claims 29
and 30 depend upon claim 26, they "do not contain the
limitation at issue in Claim 27” (page 2 of Request).

We agree with appellants that claim 29, being dependent
upon claim 26, does not specify that the conductive layer is
horizontally oriented on an annealed edge. Accordingly, we
will grant appellants‘ request and modify our decision by
reversing the examiner‘s rejection of claim 29 under § 112,
first paragraph. However, we disagree with appellants‘
assessment of claim 30, which recites "said conductive layers
are horizontally oriented and spaced apart on said annealed
edge.” Hence, contrary to appellants‘ argument, claim 30
does, in fact, contain the limitation at issue in claim 27.

Accordingly, we deny appellants‘ request to modify our

ON RE! QUEST FOR REHEARING

This decision is in response to appellant’ s request for reconsideration’ of our decision mailed

February 20, 1998, wherein the examiner’s rejection of claims 23, 24, 26, 27 and 43-47 under 35

Appeal No. 97-2967
Application 07/908,967

U.S.C. § 103 over Gerszewski in View of Hutton was sustained.

We have carefully considered appellant’s arguments in the request, however, we are not
persuaded that our decision was in error in any respect.

Appellant argues that because Hutton describes an anchor and Gerszewski describes a footing,
the devices of Hutton and Gerszewski are related to non—ana1ogous art. Appellant also argues that
there is no suggestion to combine the teachings of these references. The argument directed to non-
analogous art is not properly before us because it was not previously advanced in appellant’s brief or
reply brief for the examiner’s consideration and is not rebuttal to anything set forth in our decision. E
Ex parte Hindersinn, 177 USPQ 78 (Bd App. 1971). In regard to the suggestion to combine
Gerszewski and Hutton appellant is directed to pages 7 and 8 of our decision. We only add that while
appellant is correct that a footing is a load bearing device which transfers load to the earth, a footing
also anchors a building to the ground and therefore movement of the footing in any direction would act
to destabilize the building. As such, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to
form a footing as taught by Hutton to make the footing more resistant to upward movement.

In regard to the asserted long felt need of the claimed footing, appellant argues that the need to

prevent movement of a footing is so well recognized that it should not need further proof.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 97-2967
Application 07/908,967

In support of this proposition, appellant has ﬁled a copy of several pages from the text Structural
Engineering Handbook, (Gaylord, Jr. et al., Fourth Edition, McGraw—Hill, 1997) as Exhibit 1 to the
request. We will not consider the Structural Engineering Handbook because it was not accompanied
by a showing of good and sufﬁcient reasons why it was not earlier presented. 37 CFR § 1.195. In
regard to appellant’s argument that no proof is needed to establish long felt need, we refer to page 8 of
our decision.

In light of the foregoing, appellant’s request is granted to the extent of reconsidering our
decision, but is denied with respect to making any changes thereof.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be

ON BRIEF

 

Before KIMLIN, GARRIS and OWENS, Administrative Patent Judges.

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Appellants request a rehearing from our decision mailed on
October 12, 2000 wherein we affirmed the rejection of claims 29,
31-38, 45-54, 60, 61, 64, 65 and 67-69 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over
the combination of Clark, Saegusa, Persello, Itoh, Noguchi,

Clough, and appellants’ admitted prior art.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3169
Application O8/211,791

Appellants argue that their statement that no reference of
record provides a teaching of a process for coating particles
obtained by fragmentation from a solidified liquid precursor on a
substrate with a metal oxide, or the product produced thereby,
addressed the combined teachings of the references as a whole
(request, page 1). Stating that no single reference provides
such a teaching, however, does not address the combined teachings
of the references.

Appellants argue that we misapprehended the significance of
the metal oxide layer being coated on the particles after they
are separated in fragments from a solidified layer on the
substrate (request, page 1). Itoh, appellants argue, is silent
as to the timing of the coating with metal oxide (request,
page 2). The teaching by Itoh, however, that the coating
improves the resistance against chalking and discoloring of the
pigment, would have fairly suggested, to one of ordinary skill in
the art, coating a pigment after fragmentation so that the entire
surface of the pigment is provided with such resistance. The
inquiry under 35 U.S.C. § 103 is not merely what references
expressly teach, but what inferences one of ordinary skill in the
art reasonably would draw from them. See In re Lamberti, 545

F.2d 747, 750, 192 USPQ 278, 280 (CCPA 1976); In re Preda, 401

Application O8/211,791

F.2d 825, 826, 159 USPQ 342, 344 (CCPA 1968).

Appellants argue that in the Bruckner declaration a
temperature of 600°C was applied to the comparative pigments to
test them for heat resistance, and that this temperature was not
the temperature used in preparing the pigments (request, page 2).
The comparative pigments prepared according to Clarke's method,
appellants argue, exhibit inferior heat resistance compared to
appellants’ pigments. See id. Clarke teaches that good results
generally may be obtained by heating the pigment to 450°C, or a
higher temperature if desired, when dehydrating it during its
preparation, and that the pigment so prepared has good heat
resistance (col. 7, lines 51-55). The Bruckner declaration shows
(figure 1) that the comparative pigment made according to
Clarke's method lost luster and delaminated when it was heated to
600°C, whereas appellants’ pigment, when heated to 850°C
(figures 2 and 3), had an excellent luster and did not
delaminate.

Even if the declaration shows a significant difference
between the heat resistances of the tested pigments, the
declaration is not sufficient for overcoming the prima facie case
of obviousness because, first, as stated in our decision

(page 6), the thicknesses of the layers are not disclosed and,

_3_




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3169
Application 08/211,791

therefore, the significance of any differences shown between the
properties of the pigments is questionable. Second, as explained
in our decision (pages 7-8), the teaching by Itoh that coating
Tioz with the disclosed materials improves resistance against
chalking and discoloring and, therefore, reasonably appears to
improve gloss, indicates that the improved luster of appellants’
pigment would have been expected by one of ordinary skill in the
art. Third, as explained in our decision (pages 8-9), the
evidence in the declaration is not commensurate in scope with the
claims. Appellants argue (request, page 2) that Itoh does not
suggest applying a metal oxide coating after fragmenting the
pigment. As discussed above, however, one of ordinary skill in
the art would have been led by Itoh to coat a pigment after it
has been fragmented so that the entire surface of each pigment
particle is provided with the disclosed resistance to chalking
and discoloring.

Appellants argue that the board improperly overlooked the
reply brief because its nonentry is not an option for the
examiner (request, page 2). The propriety of the nonentry of a
reply brief is a petitionable matter rather than an appealable
matter. See Manual of'Patent Examining Procedure § 1002.02(c)(8)

(7th ed., rev. 1, Feb. 2000). Because the reply brief was not

_4_




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3169

entered into the record prior to our consideration of the appeal,
our refusal to consider the reply brief was proper.

We have considered appellants’ rehearing request but, for
the above reasons, decline to make any change to our decision.

examiner's rejections of claims 8 through 12 under 35 U.S.C. §
103 as being unpatentable over (1) Preiss in view of Harris,
Ponczek, Wetterhorn and MIL—STD—454F and (2) Preiss in View of
Harris, Ponczek, Wetterhorn and Akeyoshi, Ballentine or Jin.

We have carefully considered the arguments raised by
appellant in the request for rehearing, however, those
arguments do not persuade us that our decision was in error in
any respect.

The first argument (pages 1 and 2) raised by appellant is
that “appellants' ‘joint’ is comprised of solder that
fractures to allow a controlled release and is not dependent
nor structurally equivalent” to the plug taught by Ponczek
(emphasis original). Specifically, appellant calls our
attention to Ponczek’s teaching that the pressure relief valve
78 “blows” upon a predetermined increase in pressure within
the housing 11 (col. 4, lines 6 and 7) while claim 1 calls for

a “joint” comprised of solder that fractures at a




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3704
Application O8/572,183

“predetermined value of overpressure” to release the
overpressure “at a selectively controlled rate."

We are not persuaded by this argument, which we view as
another attempt to establish nonobviousness by attacking the
references individually when the rejection is predicated upon
a combination of prior art disclosures. See Paper No. 14,
page 12. While Ponczek does disclose that the pressure relief
valve 78, which includes rivet 82 and resilient adhesive 85,
will actuate or “blow” upon a predetermined increase in
pressure, the reference does not suggest that this actuation
must be explosive for the pressure relief valve to operate
properly. The affirmed rejections are based on the combined
teachings of Preiss, Harris and Ponczek. As appellant
recognizes (request for rehearing, page 2), Harris
specifically teaches a plug 16 for controlling the admission
of gases to a Bourdon gauge to safeguard the Bourdon tube
against rupture. We cannot find in the record either evidence
or a well—reasoned argument why Ponczek’s pressure relief
valve would not be capable of releasing an overpressure

condition in a Bourdon tube at a selectively controlled rate




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3704
Application 08/572,183

where the Bourdon tube inlet is provided with a throttling
plug as taught by Harris.

At page 3 of the request for rehearing, appellant repeats
assertions made in the main and reply briefs (Paper Nos. 10
and 12, respectively), namely, that the pressure relief valve
78 of Ponczek could not be used in a Bourdon tube without
adversely affecting the tube, that the combination would
render Preiss3 inoperative or unsatisfactory for its intended
purpose and lack of motivation to combine the teachings of the
references. These assertions were duly considered and found
to be wanting for the reasons expressed on pages 9 through 11
of our decision. Simply put, the appellant's arguments are no
more persuasive now than they were before.

The appellant's request is granted to the extent of
reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to

making any changes therein.

3 Actually, the request for rehearing (page 4) refers to Ponczek as
being rendered unsatisfactory for its intended purpose. We presume the
reference to Ponczek is a typographical error and appellant intended to refer
to Preiss, since the rejections of claims 1 and 2 were based on a proposed
modification of Preiss, not Ponczek.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on appellants’ request for rehearing

of our earlier decision entered May 29, 2001, wherein we

affirmed the examiner's rejections of the appealed claims

under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103. This decision is rendered subsequent to the oral

hearing dated July 12, 2001 consistent with appellants’

request in the Request for Rehearing dated June 15, 2001.

SMITH, Administrative Patent

*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4283
Application No. 08/342,695

We have carefully considered the arguments raised by
appellants in the Request for Rehearing. However, we are not
persuaded by those arguments to alter our earlier decision
entered May 29, 2001.

Initially, we note that appellants argue that we
overlooked dependent claims 2 and 3 which were separately
argued at page 8, lines 3-10, of the Brief. See the Request
for Rehearing, page 2. However, we are not persuaded that
those claims are separately patentable over the applied prior
art. As indicated in our earlier decision, appellants have
not timely challenged the examiner's determination that
“[a]ppellants do not provide reasons why each appealed claim
is considered separately patentable [over the applied prior
art]." See, e.g., Reply Brief. Thus, we determine that the
patentability of those claims stands or falls together with
the patentability of claim 13.

Even were we to consider those claims separately, our
conclusion will not be changed. As acknowledged by appellants
(Brief, page 5), the applied prior art references, namely
Kurofuchi and Yonezawa, teach employing less than or equal to

5000 ppm strontium or less than or equal to 150 ppm strontium,

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4283
Application No. 08/342,695

which are all inclusive of the amount of strontium recited in
claim 2. Moreover, the applied prior art references, namely
Latkowski, Kurofuchi and Yonezawa, teach employing the amount
of zirconium recited in claim 3. Thus, it would have been
prima facie obvious to employ workable or optimum proportions
of strontium and/or zirconium in the aluminum alloy described

or suggested in the applied prior art. See In re Malagari,

499 F.2d 1297, 1303, 182 USPQ 549, 553 (CCPA 1974).

Appellants also argue that we overlooked the sufficiency
of the Koch declaration in rebutting the prima facie cases
established by the examiner. However, we are not persuaded of
any error on our part for the reasons set forth at pages 5 and
6 of our earlier decision. We find that appellants have not
evinced either directly or indirectly that the claimed entire
concentration ranges of Magnesium and Manganese are shown to
be critical. See In re Clemens, 622 F.2d 1029, 1035, 206 USPQ
289, 296 (CCPA 1980). Nor have appellants evinced that the
showing limited to a single aluminum alloy having specific
proportions of silicon, magnesium, manganese, strontium,

aluminum, iron, copper, zinc and titanium is sufficient to




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4283
Application No. 08/342,695

support the myriad of alloys covered by the appealed claims.
Clemens, 622 F.2d at 1035, 206 USPQ at 296. Appellants have
not demonstrated that the unexpected improvements attributable
to the alloy tested in the Koch declaration are attributable
to those claimed alloys containing either no or only some of
strontium, iron, copper, zinc, titanium and zirconium. The
need for a broader and more representative showing is even
more compelling in view of appellants’ own argument regarding
the effect of the presence of certain proportions of certain
alloy components, such as zirconium and strontium, in the
claimed alloy. See Brief, page 8.
In view of the foregoing, appellants’ request for

rehearing is granted to the extent of reconsidering our
earlier decision entered May 29, 2001, but is denied with

respect to making any changes thereto.

JERRY SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants filed a request for rehearing on August 23,
2000 responsive to a decision by the Board mailed on June 23,
2000. In that decision, the Board affirmed the rejection of
claims 1-6, 19 and 21, and reversed the rejection of claims 7-
15 and 17. Appellants request that we reconsider that portion

of

1 Administrative Patent Judge Frahm, who authored the

original decision, is no longer at the Board.

38




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

the decision of June 23, 2000 wherein the Board affirmed the
rejection of claims 1-6, 19 and 21 as unpatentable under
35 U.S.C. § 103.

We have reconsidered the decision of June 23, 2000 in
light of appellants’ comments in the request for rehearing,
and we find no errors therein. We, therefore, decline to make
any changes in the prior decision for the reasons which
follow.

The request for rehearing initially points to supposed
errors made by the Board in affirming the rejection of claims
1-6. Claims 1-6 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being
unpatentable over the teachings of Tsujino and Fukuyama.
Appellants argue that the Board failed to consider the proper
meaning of the word “set” when viewed in light of the
disclosure. Specifically, appellants argue that the term
“set” means a “pre-specified tool is or is not present"
[request, page 3]. The earlier decision relied on Tsujino for
teaching this recitation of independent claim 1. Appellants
argue that a “tool set condition displaying means” cannot be
met by the types of tool parameters described by Tsujino or

Fukuyama. We do not agree.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

First, we note that the definition proposed by
appellants is not mandated by any special definition set forth
in the specification. Second, Tsujino does not simply
disclose tool parameters such as length, diameter and offset,
but also discloses the ability to identify or discriminate the
type of tool within the tool holder. This discrimination in
Tsujino is done for the same purpose disclosed by appellants
which is to prevent the use of the wrong tool. Tsujino states
that “the tool to be carried to the spindle 3 by the tool
changing apparatus 4 is checked by the receiver 30 arranged at
the position B to see if it is the designated proper tool or
not. Therefore, it is possible to prevent that the workpiece
is erroneously worked by use of the improper tool" [column 7,
lines 10-15]. Thus, Tsujino determines if a tool located in
the tool holder is the correct tool for the job. The data for
identifying the tool is “set condition” data within the
meaning of the claims. The earlier decision agreed with the
examiner that displaying machine tool data was well known as
evidenced by Fukuyama. We still agree with the examiner's

conclusion that it would have been obvious within the meaning




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

of 35 U.S.C. § 103 to display any tool identifying information
of Tsujino as taught by Fukuyama.
We now consider the Board's earlier decision with
respect to claims 19 and 21 which were rejected under 35
U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over admitted prior art in
view of Takeuchi. With respect to claim 19, appellants’
arguments are directed to the workpiece data set indicating
means. This means is recited for stopping a program,
displaying workpiece data, or prompting an operator. In the
earlier decision, the Board noted that this element was
satisfied by prior art which performs any one of the three
claimed functions, and the Board considered that Takeuchi
taught at least the function of stopping. Appellants argue
that the stopping function is not performed by Takeuchi
because there is no affirmative action taken to stop the
processing of the program and nothing inherently requires the
program in Takeuchi to stop when the data runs out [request,
pages 5-6].
Although the Board considered only the claimed

function of stopping and found stopping in Takeuchi when the

data runs out, we find that Takeuchi teaches much more than




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

the original panel considered. Specifically, Takeuchi teaches
an affirmative action of not moving a tool to the machining
center when the data is inaccurate [note column 9, lines 28-
32]. As noted in Takeuchi, the movement of the defective
pallet is inhibited. We view such inhibition of movement as
an action of stopping processing of a program. We also view
such stopping as a stopping when necessary workpiece data has
not been set in said workpiece fixing means as recited in
claim 19.

We are also of the view that Takeuchi teaches the
prompting function of claim 19. Takeuchi states that “[i]f
the normal data cannot be received even after the resending
operation was requested a predetermined number of times, the
CPU 30 of the write/readout unit 25 turns on the error
indicator 72, thereby instructing the checking by the
operator” [column 8, lines 13-17]. Such an indication to the
operator would have suggested the claimed prompting of an
operator to set workpiece data.

With respect to claim 21, the Board in the earlier
decision observed that the claimed position and height data of

each workpiece was conventional information that would have

5




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

been obvious to store in the admitted prior art and Takeuchi
combination. Appellants argue that the admitted prior art
usage of position and height data does not suggest the
efficient and accurate positional control achieved by the
claimed invention [request, pages 8-9].

Takeuchi discloses that “even if the machining
condition differs for every workpiece every pallet, the pallet
itself has the machining data corresponding to the machining
condition” [column 9, lines 39-42]. This passage suggests
that whatever data is needed to properly machine a given
workpiece is stored in a workpiece data storage means (the
pallet). The artisan would have appreciated that no workpiece
can be properly machined unless the relative positional
dimensions and locations of the tool and the workpiece are
stored as part of the machining program. Therefore, we still
agree with the examiner's conclusion that it would have been
obvious to store position and height data of each workpiece in
a workpiece data storage means.

Appellants argue that the means plus function language
of claims 1-6, 19 and 21 has not been properly interpreted.

This argument was first made at the oral hearing, and the

6




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

earlier Board decision noted that this argument was not timely
made since the issue had not been addressed in the brief.
Appellants note that 37 CFR § 1.193(b)(1) was amended to
permit an appellant to file a reply brief without restriction
to new points of argument. The relevance of this argument is
not understood because appellants filed no reply brief in this
application. The critical question as we view it is the
timeliness of the arguments with respect to the interpretation
of the means plus function language.

Appellants are correct to assert that the examiner has
the responsibility to interpret means plus function language
in the manner required by the sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. §
112. Whether or not the examiner successfully complied with
this responsibility, however, is a legal and factual question
which must be argued. When a rejection on appeal is decided
by the Board, arguments not made by appellant in the brief are
not considered and are effectively waived. Appellants’
failure to address the question of claim interpretation in the
brief has deprived us of an opportunity to consider the
examiner's position with respect to this question. Thus, we

agree with the earlier Board decision that appellants’

7




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

arguments related to claim interpretation were not timely made
at oral hearing and, therefore, are not timely made as part
of this request for rehearing.

We note appellants’ request that we remand this
application to the examiner for a consideration of the claim
interpretation question. For reasons discussed above, we
decline to remand this application to consider an issue which
was not timely raised. Appellants are free to argue this
issue, however, in continued prosecution of this invention
before the examiner. In summary, we have carefully
considered the arguments raised by appellants in their request
for rehearing, but we can find no errors in the original Board
decision. We are of the view that the invention set forth in
claims 1-6, 19 and 21 would have been obvious within the
meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 103 in view of the applied prior art.

We have granted appellants’ request to the extent that
we have reconsidered the decision of June 23, 2000, but we
deny the request with respect to making any changes therein.

No period for taking any subsequent action in connection
with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

Decision on Appeal and Opinion

This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from the decision of the examiner ﬁnally rejecting
claims 1 through 11.1

We have carefully considered the record before us, and based thereon, ﬁnd that we carmot
sustain the ground of rejection of claims 1 through 8 and 11 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being
unpatentable over Murray and Anderson et a1., and the gound of rejection of claims 9 and 10 under 35
U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over Kignell ir1 view of Murray and Perry et a1.2’3

It is well settled that “[t]he consistent criterion for determination of obviousness is whetl1er the
prior art wo11ld have suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art that [the claimed process] should be
carried out and wo11ld have a reasonable likelihood of success, viewed in the light of the prior art.
[Citations omitted] Both the suggestion and the expectation of success must be founded in the prior art,
not in the applicant’s disclosure.” In re Dow Chem. Ca., 837 F.2d 469, 473, 5 USPQ2d 1529, 1531
(Fed. Cir. 1988). Thus, a prima facie case of obviousness is established by showing that some
objective teaching, suggestion or motivation in the applied prior art taken as a whole and/or knowledge
generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art would have led that person to the claimed invention
as a whole, including each and every limitation of the claims, witl1out recourse to the teachings in
appellants’ disclosure. See generally, In re Rouﬁet, 149 F.3d 1350, 1358, 47 USPQ2d 1453, 1458
(Fed. Cir. 1998); Pr0—M0ld and Tool Co. v. Great Lakes Plastics Inc., 75 F.3d 1568, 1573,
37 USPQ2d 1626, 1629-30 (Fed. Cir. 1996); In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1447-48, 24 USPQ2d
1443, 1446-47 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Nies, J ., concurring); In re Laskawski, 871 F.2d 115, 10 USPQ2d
1397 (Fed. Cir. 1989); In re Fine, 837 F.2d 1071, 1074-76, 5 USPQ2d 1596, 1598-1600 (Fed.
Cir. 1988). We agree witl1 appellants that the examiner has failed to carry his burden of making out a

primafacie case of obviousness with respect to the claimed invention.

We ﬁnd that the process for the selective removal of hydrogen sulphide from gas containing
hydrogen and carbon dioxide by absorption in carbonate- containing alkaline solutions is speciﬁed in
appealed claim 1 to “multiple stages of circulating carbonate-containing alkaline solutions” and
“adjusting the pH in each stage . . . to about 9- 12 by the addition of a hydroxi ” to obtain a “total
sulphide content exceeding about 0.30 mole/l in the outgoing solution.” Thus, the claim requires at least
that the hydrogen sulphide must be recovered as a sulphide.

We ﬁnd that Murray discloses that the prior art process of merely absorbing hydrogen sulphide
in an alkaline solution ﬁon1 a gas containing the sulphide and carbon dioxide is inefﬁcient (col. 2, lines
19- 33). Murray teaches that the absorption of hydrogen sulﬁde by maintaining the aqueous alkaline

solution, which contains sodium ions and preferably carbonate ions, at a pH of about 9.0 and above so

3 The examiner withdrew the ground of rejection of claims 1 through 8 and 11 under § 103 as being




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4399
Application 08/505,338

that “continuous absorption of the sulphur containing compounds may be achieved through the removal
of the absorbed sulphide ions in the aqueous solution by oxidation with an oxygen containing gas,”
wherein the “principal oxidation product is the thiosulphate ion with lesser arrrounts of sulphate and
sulphite ions as well as minor amounts of elemental sulphur” (col. 2, lines 34-48; emphasis supplied).
While Mmray teaches that it is “critical . . . that the pH of the aqueous alkaline solution is maintained
about 9.0 and above throughout the absorption” (col. 3, lines 31-43), it is clear from the reference that
the disclosed process “substantially increase hydrogen sulphide absorption by  the
equilibrium partial pressure of the hydrogen sulﬁde [sic] at a level near zero . . . by reducing the effective
concentration of sodium sulﬁde [sic] . . . [which is] kept at a level near zero by the oxidation of the
hydrogen sulfide [sic] absorbed in the solution” (col. 3, lines 62-73). We ﬁnd that Anderson discloses a
process (col. 4, lines 29-39), without stating the pH at which it is conducted, that is similar to the
process which Murray acknowledged to be in the prior art.

Upon comparing the claimed invention with the applied combination of references, we carmot
agree with the examiner’s position that one of mdinary skill in this art would “by-pass the oxidation step
. . . of Murray” in order to obtain a “sulphide solution” that can be used to prepare “white liquor” as
suggested by Anderson in a similar process (answer, e.g., pages 5-6 and 10-13). Indeed, as appellants
point out in their brief, there is no apparent suggestion, teaching or motivation in the combined teachings
of the references which would have led one of ordinary skill in this art to delete the oxidation step taught
by Murray to be necessary for the “continuous” absorption of hydrogen sulphide. We also fail to ﬁnd in
the applied references any apparent suggestion, teaching or motivation to modify the prior art process
acknowledged by Murray to be inefﬁcient by using multiple stages of circulating carbonate— containing
alkaline solutions, each maintained at a pH of about 9- 12, to achieve the amount of total sulphide
content speciﬁed in appealed claim 1. Thus, on this record, we nmst conclude that the exarniner’s
position is based onirnpermissible hindsight. See generally, Dow Chem. Co., supra.

We have considered the apparatus encompassed by appealed claim 9 with respect to the
qaeciﬁc str'ucture recited therein, that is, without respect to the material intended to be worked on by the

 

unpatentable over Kent in view of Kigrrell (answer, page 2).

apparatus or to the manner in which the apparatus is intended to be employed. Cf. Ex parte
Maxham, 2 USPQ2d 1647, 1648 (Ed. Pat. App. & Int. 1987), and cases cited therein. Tlms, we
interpretclaim9tospecifyanapparamscmnpdsingatleast“acontainer. . . containingpacking
arranged in a number of successive stages” and means for supplying, treating and moving a ﬂuid in,
through and between the stages.

In comparing the claimed apparatus encompassed by claim 9 with the teachings of the applied
combination of references, we must agree with appellants (brief, e.g., pages 19-20) that the differences
between the structure of the apparatus disclosed in Kignell and the structure of the claimed apparatus
are not merely (1) the means for supplying a reagent to a solution in each stage and (2) the absence of
packing in “one of the scrubbing stages” as contended by the examiner (answer, pages 6-8; emphasis
supplied; see also pages 13- 14). Indeed, claim 9 speciﬁes that the packing creates “successive stages”
and the means for intra- and inter- stage movement of a solution. At best, Murray would have suggested
means to add a reagent to one stage as shown in that reference and Perry et al. disclose “impingement
separators” which, in the absence of an explanation, do not appear to involve ﬂuid ﬂow with respect to
“stages” in the manner speciﬁed for the claimed apparatus.

Thus, in considering the claimed apparatus encompassed by appealed claim 9 as a whole,
including each and every claim  we fail to ﬁnd in the combination of references applied by the
examiner any teaching, suggestion or motivation in the applied prior art taken as a whole which would
have led one of ordinary skill in this art to the claimed apparatus. Indeed, the modiﬁcations suggested
by Murray and/or Perry et al. would not have resulted in any limitation of the claimed apparatus.
Uniroyal, Inc. v. Rudkin-Wiley Corp., 837 F.2d 1044, 1050-54, 5 USPQ2d 1434, 1438-41 (Fed.
Cir. 1988). Therefore, it is manifest from the record that the examiner had to rely on hindsight gained
from appellants’ invention in order to reach his conclusion that the invention encompassed by the
appealed claims would have been obvious from the applied prior art. See generally, Fine, supra.

ON BRIEF

Judges.

HAIRSTON, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has requested that we reconsider our December
21, 2000 decision wherein we affirmed the obviousness
rejection of claim 9.

In a discussion of the Stern reference, we explained that
“the roll inhibiting device 51 is only in the Figure 6

embodiment," and that “[s]uch a roll inhibiting device is not




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-0860
Application No. 08/365,710

in the other embodiment”‘ disclosed by Stern” (Decision, page
3). Appellant argues (Request, page 1) that “Figure 1 shows
the inhibiting device 51, albeit there is no number on the
drawing (see the heavy lined block below numeral 41)."
Inasmuch as Stern is completely silent as to a description of
the element near numeral 41 in Figure 1, we will not assume
that it is a roll—inhibiting device. When Figures 1 through 6
are discussed together in the description of the invention,
Stern indicates that they are not the same embodiment because
she uses the term “embodiments” (column 4, line 42) to refer
to these figures. In the “BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS,”
for example, Stern indicates (column 2, lines 40 and 41) that
“FIG. 6 illustrates a modification to an end of the spring-
strip depicted in FIGS. 5a and 5b." Stern clearly explains
(column 4, lines 17 through 35) that the roll—inhibiting
device 51 was added to the Figure 6 embodiment “to ensure that

spring—strip 41 rolls from the top edge 21 of the bag, rather

than from bottom edge 23."

‘Appellant has correctly argued (Request, page 2) that
the roll—inhibiting device 51 is in the “species of figures 7-
9."




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-0860
Application No. 08/365,710

In summary, Stern discloses three distinct embodiments
(i.e., Figures 1 through 5 are a first embodiment, Figure 6 is
a second embodiment, and Figures 7 through 9 are a third
embodiment), and the roll—inhibiting device 51 is only used in
the latter two embodiments. Accordingly, appellant's request

has




*** PAGE 4 ***

been granted to the extent that our decision has been
reconsidered, but such request is denied with respect to
making any modifications to the decision.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R.
§ l.l36(a).

RECONSIDERATION

Before THOMAS, HAIRSTON, and JERRY SMITH, A_dm'n'§trative Eaten)‘, Judges.

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

In a paper filed January 3, 2001, appellants request that we reconsider our decision
dated November 8, 2000, wherein we sustained only the rejection of claims 6 through 10
under 35 U.S.C. § 103. In that decision, we reversed the examiner's rejection of
independent claims 13 and 14 and their respective dependent claims

2 through 5 and 12. Appellants’ request for rehearing sets forth three basic points.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1813
Application 08/476,178

Appellants‘ disclosed basis under which the claimed invention is recited is most
aptly reflected in the description in the specification in the paragraph bridging pages 5 and
6 stating “the reflection of the upper object to be detected in the surface of the lower
substrate and relative motion imparted to the substrates eliminating the reflection
produces alignment." In a summary manner at page 7 of the specification as filed it is
stated that “alignment of superpositioned objects on opposing substrates is achieved
through relative movement of the substrates responsive to an image of one object reflected
from the surface of the opposite substrate."

Our original opinion carefully parsed the language of respective independent claims
13, 14 and 6 to indicate the recitations therein in claims 13 and 14 that led us to conclude
the rejection of these claims and their respective dependent claims must be reversed yet
also conclude the unpatentability under 35 U.S.C. § 102 of independent claim 6 and its
respective dependent claims. The above-quoted portions of the specification as filed are
most aptly reflected in independent claim 13 as generally expressed in our original opinion
at page 3. Claim 13 was said to specifically recite that the reflected light is from the
supporting substrate as a distinguishing factor over the teachings of the applied reference.
Similarly, we noted that the reference did not determine any reduction of any reflected light
according to the operation of the reference's system in Figure 2 but that which is recited at

the end of claim 13 on appeal. Neither of these features are recited in independent claim




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1813
Application 08/476,178

6 on appeal. The features of independent claim 14 were discussed at page 4 of our
original opinion where we indicated the basis of our reversal of the rejection of this claim
because it contained a recitation of the relative movement of the substrates to bring
together or otherwise align the first and second substrates that was stated to be in
response to the elimination of the claimed reflection. Again, this feature is not recited in
independent claim 6 as our opinion at pages 4 and 5 so indicates.

Our discussion of claim 14 at page 4 of our original opinion indicates that the
reflection of the image in this claim is different than the reflection in independent claim 13
and, at the same time, we indicated that the recitation in claim 6 is comparable to that in
claim 14. Claim 6 requires that the observation of a reflected image be “of a first
conductor on an area of said first substrate" where the meaning of this language is that the
first conductor must be physically on the area of the first substrate. The claim does not
require that a reflected image be from a substrate as recited in independent claim 13 on
appeal. This was explained in detail in the paragraph bridging pages 4 and 5 of our
original opinion. Claim 6 states that the first conductor is on the first substrate and not that
a reflected image comes from any substrate at all. We also sustained the rejection of
claim 6 because there is no positive statement of any alignment occurring as
contemplated at line 4 of claim 6 by the recited means for relatively moving at the end of

this claim.




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1813
Application 08/476,178

Page 3 of our original opinion indicated that our understanding of L'Esperance is
that a visual comparison is made between the light reflected from the actual surfaces of the
conductive members 16 and 18 as in Figure 2 and not from the surfaces of the integrated
circuit chip 12 or of the substrate 14. The reflected image recited in claim 6 is consistent
with this teaching as our original opinion indicated.

Therefore, as to appellants‘ first point, appellants effectively argue at pages 1 and 2
of the request for rehearing the disclosed rather than the claimed invention as it applies to
the recitations in claim 6. Our decision as well as our amplification here makes clear that
we fully understand the optical principles on which the claimed invention is intended to be
recited but it is not recited in such a degree of specificity in claim 6 as is required to
distinguish over the applied prior art as in the other independent claims 13 and 14 on
appeal. A careful consideration of our affirmance as to claim 6 in the original opinion as
well as the amplifying comments in this opinion as to claim 6 make clear that the language
of this claim is not as specific in more than one respect as is the language setting forth the
features of independent claims 13 and 14 on appeal on which we reversed the rejection.
Therefore, we remain unpersuaded of any error of our original opinion as to appellants’
second point. Finally, as to the third point at page 3 of the request for rehearing, the term
"image" as recited in the respective claims on appeal has been clearly understood by us.

There is no ambiguity in each of the recited claims as to the meaning of the term causing

4




*** PAGE 5 ***

Application 08/476,178

us to ascertain any further meaning from the specifications‘ teachings. We, at the same
time, will not read any limitations of the specification into the claims to further limit them.

In view of the foregoing, appellants’ request for rehearing is granted to the extent

that we have, in fact, reviewed our findings, but is denied as to making any change therein.

Appeal No. 1998-2066
Application No. 08/315,629

ON BRIEF

Before MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, NASE and
GONZALES, Administrative Patent Judges.

GONZALES, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING
This is in response to the appellant's request for
rehearingl (hereinafter "request") of our decision mailed June

29, 2000 (Paper No. 40), wherein we affirmed, inter alia, the

1 Filed August 28, 2000.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2066
Application No. 08/315,629

examiner's rejections of claims 1 through 4 and 8 through 20
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, and of claim 7 under

35 U.S.C. § 135(b). The request seeks an order (1) remanding the
application to the examiner with instructions to reopen
prosecution as to the § 112, second paragraph, issues; and (2)
reversing the examiner's rejection of claim 7 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 135(b).

The appellant seeks a remand with instruction to the
examiner to enter the amendment filed December 5, 1997, because
of a “clear factual error" (emphasis original) by the examiner.
See the request, p. 3. However, the appellant has failed to
identify any error on the part of the examiner which necessitates
a remand in this case.

The examiner's indication in the advisory action mailed
November 7, 1997 (Paper No. 34), that the 35 U.S.C. § 112, second
paragraph, rejection of claims 8, 14 and 20 had been overcome by
the amendment filed with the brief on August 4, 1997, which
amendment was refused entry, was an error.2 However, this error
was certainly not the reason for the appellant's failure to

present arguments in the brief concerning the § 112, second

 

2 Instead, the examiner should have indicated the status of claims 8, 14

and 20, if the proposed amendments to those particular claims were filed in a
separate paper. See MPEP §§ 714.13 and 1207.

2




*** PAGE 3 ***

Application No. 08/315,629

paragraph, issues, since the error occurred after the brief was
filed. Nor does the error explain the appellant's failure to
file a timely reply brief addressing the § 112, second paragraph,
issues after having received the advisory action mailed November
7, 1997 and the examiner's answer repeating the § 112, second
paragraph, rejection of claims 1 through 4 and 8 through 20.

We also note that the advisory action mailed December 18,
1997, does not state that the appellant's brief was untimely.
Rather, it clearly states that “the proposed amendment filed
December 5, 1997 is not timely and cannot be considered and/or
entered.” See Paper No. 37, p. 2.3

Under 35 U.S.C. § 134 and 37 CFR § 1.191, appeals to the
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences are taken from the
decision of the primary examiner to reject claims. We exercise
no general supervisory power over the examining corps and
decisions of primary examiners to deny entry of amendments are

not subject to our review. ee 37 CFR § 1.127 and Manual of

Patent Examining_Procedure (MPEP) §§ 1002.02(c) and 1201 (7th

 

3 37 can § 1.116(b) reads:

If amendments touching the merits of the application or patent under
reexamination are presented after final rejection, or after appeal has
been taken, or when such amendment might not otherwise be proper, they
may be admitted upon a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they
are necessary and were not earlier presented.

USPQ 566, 568 (CCPA 1967) and In re Deters, 515 F.2d 1152, 1156,
185 USPQ 644, 648 (CCPA 1975). Were we to grant the appellant's
request, we would, in effect, he overruling the examiner's
decision to refuse entry of the amendment filed December 5, 1997.
We decline to take such action. Accordingly, the request for a
remand is denied.

In our earlier decision we compared appealed claim 7, which
corresponds to claim 1 of the Muller patent, to the appellant's
original claims 1 through 5 and determined that the subject
matter of the appellant's original claims 1 through 5 is directed
to an invention that is not “substantially the same” as the
invention claimed in claim 7. Specifically, we found that none
of the appellant's original claims 1 through 5 contain any
express language directed to “a circumferential groove having a
first radial depth and a second radial depth extending further
radially inwardly than said first radial depth,” which based on
the file history of the Muller patent we concluded is a material
part of the subject matter of claim 7.

The request alleges (request, p. 9) that “Muller's claim 1
and appellant's claim 1 are for substantially the same subject
matter.” In support, the appellant refers to his specification

and drawings and to the language “indentation means being




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2066
Application No. 08/315,629

positioned below said rim at a location adjacent said opening in
said top” in claim 1 and “an indentation in said wall portion to
accommodate the lower lip of a consumer” in claim 5.

We, of course, were aware of the language of original claims
1 and 5 at the time of our original decision. Nevertheless, the
fact remains that the language of the appellant's original claims

\\

l and 5 does not require a circumferential groove having a first
radial depth and a second radial depth extending further radially
inwardly than said first radial depth.”

The appellant also refers to his original specification and
drawings as providing support for the limitation. However, the
issue of support for the limitation in the appellant's
specification, or Muller's for that matter, is not an issue that
we must decide in order to determine whether or not claim 7 is
properly rejected under 35 U.S.C. § l35(b).

In conclusion, as to the requested rehearing of our
underlying decision, we have carefully and fully reconsidered
that decision in light of all of the commentary in the request.
However, for the reasons discussed above, we are not persuaded
to alter that earlier decision. Therefore, the request for

rehearing is granted to the extent of reconsidering our decision,

but is denied with respect to making any changes therein.




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2066
Application No. 08/315,629

Additionally, for the reasons given above, we have denied the
appellant's request for a remand.
No period for taking any subsequent action in connection

with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
This is in response to Appellants’ letter, ﬁled May 31, 2002, responding to our
decision, mailed March 22, 2002.1 In our previous decision, we affirmed the rejection of

claims 1, 3 and 5 to 13 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Takeuchi and reversed the rejection of

1 We will treat Appellants’ letter as a Requests for reconsideration under 37 CFR § 1.197(b). In
addition to the letter, Appellants presented two declarations under 35 U.S.C. § 1.132.

claims 1, 3 and 5 to 13 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Ishigaki. We also reversed the
rejection of claims 1, 3 and 5 to 13 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Wang and remanded the
application to the Examiner for proper consideration of the declaration under 37 CFR 1.130,
ﬁled March 17, 1997.2

Appellants have not argued that our decision was based on erroneous findings of fact
concerning the prior art. Rather, we find the Appellants in essence are expressing their
disagreement with the merits of our opinion. In support of their position, Appellants for the
first time present a declaration from Honan and a declaration from Isaac. We will not
consider any new arguments and/or new evidence which were not raised in the Brief. See 37
CFR § 1.192(a) (1997)(“Any arguments or authorities not included in the brief will be
refused consideration by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, unless good cause is
shown.”); SE $9 Ex parte Hindersinn, 177 USPQ 78 (Bd. App. 1971).

The evidence presented by Appellants has not been evaluated by the Examiner in this
case. Appellants have not argued that there was good cause for presenting this evidence
subsequent to the Board’s decision. See 37 CFR§ 1.195 (1969). Attempting to present

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to appellants’ “REQUEST FOR REHEARING

reversed the rejection of claims 14 through

reversed the rejection of claims 14 through

17, 20, 21, 23 through 31, 35, and 38

affirmed the rejection of claims 23, 24, 28

through 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 41 under

35 U.S.C. § 102(a) as anticipated by or, in the

alternative, under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as obvious over

and

Honshu Paper (the Japanese reference);




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. l998—2393
Application No. 08/295,874

affirmed the rejection of claims 19, 22,
34, and 37 under 35 U.S.C. § lO3 as being
unpatentable over Honshu Paper (the

Japanese reference) in view of Villez.

In the request (page l), appellants assert that this
panel of the Board relied upon an inaccurate English
translation1 of the primary reference to Honshu paper in
affirming the rejections noted above. More particularly, it
is the view of appellants that the office translation prepared
by FLS, Inc. contains several significant errors. As
perceived by appellants, the reference in the office
translation to another separate “elastic” sheet is incorrect.
To support this conclusion appellants rely upon a duplicate
copy of a previously filed (February 28, l997) “Adati Patent
Office” (Adati) translation, now accompanied by a translator’s

certificate certifying as to its accuracy, which is indicated

1 As pointed out in footnote number 2 of our earlier
decision the translation referred to by appellants was

prepared in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. l998—2393
Application No. 08/295,874

to make no mention of “elastic” in connection with the
separate sheet of different material. To confirm the Adati
translation, appellants also provide an additional partial
English translation referred to as Asamura Patent Office
(Asamura), which Asamura translation is indicated to show that

“elastic” in connection with

there is no mention of the word
the separate sheet. Based upon the inaccurate translation
relied upon by the Board, appellants conclude (request, page
7) that the earlier decision should be modified to reverse the
respective

final rejections of claims l4 through 24, 26, 28 through 38,

40, and 41.

Having fully considered the office translation of the
Japanese reference that we relied upon in sustaining the
examiner's rejections based thereon, the argument advanced in
the request, and the respective Adati and Asamura
translations, we find ourselves in accord with the appellants’
point of view that the office translation erred in referencing

the another separate sheet as being elastic.




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2393
Application No. 08/295,874

Without the separate sheet being elastic in the Japanese
reference, appellants argue (request, page 6) that the Board's
conclusion at the end of page 13 of the decision is no longer
fairly based since the stretchable elastic material 5 and
stretchable elastic material 13 together cannot be fairly said
to define an elastically stretchable region that covers
essentially the whole of at least one of the front and back
parts of the diaper as set forth independent claim 14. As
percieved by appellants, the Japanese reference shows only two
narrow strips of elastic 5,5, and 13 whereas with the present

invention a continuous region incorporates numerous elastic

elements 26.

In light of appellants’ commentary and our present
understanding of the Japanese reference, we share the View
that the applied Japanese document does not address at least
one elastically stretchable region covering essentially the
whole of at least one of the front and back parts of the
pants—type diaper of claim 14. Necessarily, it follows that
we also alter our earlier stated view (decision, page 13,

lines 1 through 7) by now indicating that the claimed “whole”

5




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. l998—2393
Application No. 08/295,874

of at least one front part and back part refers to the area of

the front or back part.

Since the evidence of obviousness would not have been
suggestive of at least one elastically stretchable region
covering essentially the whole of at least one of the front
and back parts of a pants—type diaper (claim l4), we modify
our earlier decision by not sustaining each of the examiner's
rejections under 35 U.S.C. § lO2(a) and 35 U.S.C. § lO3 which

we had earlier affirmed.

REMAND TO THE EXAMINER

We remand this application to the examiner to assess the
overall teaching of the Japanese reference with other known
prior art to ascertain whether it would have been obvious to
provide the waist band W and adjacent portions of surface

sheet l having stretchable elastic material 5, 13, in the

6




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2393
Application No. 08/295,874

panty style disposable diaper of the Japanese reference (Figs.
12 and 13), with additional stretchable elastic material to
effect at least one

elastically stretchable region covering essentially the whole
of at least one of respective front and back parts, as now

claimed.

In summary, appellants’ request for rehearing has been
granted and our earlier decision modified such that we do not
sustain each of the examiner's rejections under 35 U.S.C.
§ lO2(a) and 35 U.S.C. § 103 based upon the Japanese
reference. Accordingly, the decision of the examiner is
ggyngsﬁn (not AFFIRMED—IN—PART as originally set forth), since
each of the rejections on appeal has not been sustained.
Additionally, we have remanded the application to the examiner

to consider the matter discussed above.

Ex parte DOUGLAS R. PETERSON

Appeal No. 1998-2516
Application 08/422,440

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, JERRY SMITH and BARRETT, Administrative Patent
Judges.

JERRY SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING
Appellant has filed a paper under 37 37 CFR § §
l.l97(b) requesting that we reconsider our decision of October

27, 2000 wherein we affirmed the rejection of claims l—3, l2,

l3, l6, l7 and 20 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § lO3.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2516
Application 08/422,440

Appellant points to page 7 of the original decision
wherein the Board stated that “Smith suggests that the common
mode problem in Jove can be solved by connecting a
controllable current sink across the MR element” [Request,
page 2]. Appellant essentially argues that this conclusion by
the Board is unwarranted by anything stated or shown in the
Smith reference. Appellant also presents an analysis of the
proposed modification of Jove and asserts that the proposed
modification either would not work at all or would seriously
degrade the performance of the Jove amplifier [;g;, pages 3-
6].

We have reconsidered our decision of October 27, 2000
in light of appellant's comments in the request for rehearing,
and we find no error therein. We, therefore, decline to make
any changes in our prior decision for the reasons which
follow.

The majority of appellant's request for rehearing
raises factual questions resulting from the examiner's and the
Board's modification of Jove using the teachings of Smith.
These factual questions are being raised for the first time in

this request for rehearing and have not been considered by the

_2_




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2516
Application O8/422,440

examiner. Since appellant never raised these factual
questions with the examiner, we do not have the benefit of
the examiner's position on these questions of fact. A new
argument advanced in a request for rehearing but not advanced
in the brief or reply brief1 is not properly before the Board
because an argument advanced in such a manner has not afforded
the examiner an opportunity to respond to the new argument.
Note Ex parte Hindersinn, 177 USPQ 78

(Bd. App. 1971). Consequently, we will not consider these new
arguments of fact as a basis for changing our prior decision
in this case.

The only question properly raised by the request for
rehearing is the assertion by appellant that Smith does not
support the Board's statement that Smith suggests that the
common mode problem in Jove can be solved by connecting the
controllable current sink across the MR element. As noted in
the original decision, Smith specifically refers to the Jove

patent relied on and notes the problem caused by common mode

entered by the examiner and, consequently, were not considered
by the Board.

DC and low frequency components [Smith, column 2, line 62 to
column 3, line 17]. Smith notes that the arrangement in Jove
still requires coupling capacitors to connect the Jove

amplifier to other amplification circuitry.




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2516
Application O8/422,440

Smith describes a solution to Jove’s problem caused by
common mode DC and low frequency components. This solution is
achieved by coupling a controllable current sink to one end of
the MR element. Smith discloses that the feedback loop
comprising the controllable current sink controls common mode
DC and low frequency components, and effectively performs the
function of a coupling capacitor [column 11, lines 15-23].
Thus, the second feedback loop of Smith functions as a
replacement for the coupling capacitor alleged to be necessary
in Jove while still controlling common mode DC and low
frequency components.

Our inquiry in the original decision and our inquiry
now only concerns the nonobviousness of the invention as
broadly recited in claim 12. We still agree with the examiner
that the broad modification of Jove to include a feedback loop
comprised of a controllable current sink to solve the
recognized problem caused by common mode DC and low frequency
components would have been obvious to the artisan based on the

suggestions of Smith. The arguments of appellant properly

as a single group with claim 1.

raised in the brief and considered in our original decision
are not convincing of error in the examiner's rejection.

We have carefully considered the arguments raised by
appellant in the request for rehearing, but we can find no
errors in our original decision. We are still of the view
that the invention set forth in claim 1 would have been
obvious within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 103 in view of the
collective teachings of Jove and Smith.

We have granted appellant's request to the extent that
we have reconsidered our decision of October 27, 2000, but we
deny the request with respect to making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R.
§ l.l36(a).

HEARD: May 24, 2001

Before FLEMING, LALL, and BARRY,

Administrative Patent Judges.
BARRY, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on the appellant's request, (Paper

No. 17),

that we reconsider our decision in Ex parte Lee,

No. 1999-0009 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. June 20, 2001), which

affirmed the rejection of claims 9, 11-15, 17, 19, 20, and 22

under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being obvious over U.S. Patent No.

5,493,421 (Uetama) in view of U.S. Patent No. 5,420,693

(Horiuchi) further in view of U.S. Patent No. 4,992,884 (Sakata)

even further in view of U.S. Patent No. 5,335,085 (Nakatsuma).

Our decision also reversed the rejection of claims 1, 7, and 8

under § 103(a) as being obvious over Uetama in view of Horiuchi;

18




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0009
Application O8/648,386

the rejection of claim 2 under § 103(a) as being obvious over
Uetama in view of Horiuchi further in view of Nakatsuma; the
rejection of claim 3 under § 103(a) as being obvious over Uetama
in view of Horiuchi further in view of Sakata; the rejection of
claims 4-6, 10, 16, 18, and 21 under § 103(a) as being obvious
over Uetama in View of Horiuchi further in view of Sakata even
further in view of Nakatsuma; and the rejection of claims 24-31

as being obvious over Uetama in view of Sakata and Nakatsuma.

Rather than reiterate appellant's arguments in 3939, we
refer the reader to the request for the details thereof. After
reconsidering our original decision in light of the arguments,
we are persuaded of error therein regarding the nonobviousness of
claims 9, 11-15, 17, 19, 20, and 22. Therefore, we grant the

appellant's request. We consider the following claims:

- claims 9, 11-14, and 22
- claims 15, 17, 19, and 20
- claim 23.

We begin with claims 9, 11-14, and 22.

I. Claims 9, 11-14, and 22

The examiner asserts, “[s]ince Uetama serves the same

purpose as that served by the claimed invention, i.e., stop or




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0009
Application 08/648,386

omit printing the unwanted excess data, it would have been

obvious ... to applied [sic] the idea of Uetama to avoid printing
excess black data, since black and blank are the two opposition
conventions used in image printing and having too much of any
kind of the two means the whole document image will not be
properly printed.” (Final Rejection at 3.) Noting that “the
board held that the following limitations: ‘determining whether
the stored image data contains a predetermined number of
sequential lines of black data; and stopping the print operation
and displaying a print stop message, when said predetermined
number of sequential lines of black data has been determined to
have been stored in said memory,’ ... were not taught by the
applied art,” (Req. Reh’g at 10), the appellant argues, “[t]he

foregoing limitations are also found in claims [sic] 9.” (Id.)

Claims 9, ll—l4, and 22 specify in pertinent part the
following limitations: “determining whether the stored image data
contains a predetermined number of sequential lines of black
data; and stopping the print operation and displaying a print
stop message, when said predetermined number of sequential lines

of black data has been determined to have been stored in said




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0009
Application 08/648,386

memory." Accordingly, the claims require inter glia preventing a

facsimile machine from printing when a predetermined number of

sequential lines of black data have been stored in its memory.

The examiner fails to show a teaching or suggestion of the
limitations in the applied prior art. "'A prima facie case of
obviousness is established when the teachings from the prior art
itself would appear to have suggested the claimed subject matter
to a person of ordinary skill in the art.’" In re Bell, 991 F.2d
781, 782, 26 USPQ2d 1529, 1531 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (quoting ;g_;§

Ringhart, 531 F.2d 1048, 1051, 189 USPQ 143, 147 (CCPA 1976)).

Here, although Uetama teaches “[a] facsimile apparatus
capable of economizing the recording paper[,]” col. 1, ll. 8-9,
the reference does not prevent the apparatus from printing when a
predetermined number of sequential lines of black data have been
stored in its memory. To the contrary, Uetama prints marginal,
compressed data when a predetermined number of sequential lines
of blank data have been received by the apparatus. Specifically,

“in the case where a predetermined number of lines of total blank




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0009
Application O8/648,386

line data is [sic] received successively, subsequently successive

total blank line data are not printed but what is called the

marginal portion is printed by compression. As a consequence,
the unrequired [sic] marginal portion in the original is deleted
for printing, thereby conserving the amount of recording paper
consumption.” Col. 4, 11. 27-33. The addition of Horiuchi,

Sakata, and Nakatsuma does not cure the defect of Uetama.

Because Uetama prints marginal, compressed data when a
predetermined number of sequential lines of blank data have been
received, we are not persuaded that the teachings from the
applied prior art would have suggested the limitations of
“determining whether the stored image data contains a
predetermined number of sequential lines of black data; and
stopping the print operation and displaying a print stop message,
when said predetermined number of sequential lines of black data
has been determined to have been stored in said memory."
Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims 9, 11-14, and 22 as
being obvious over Uetama in view of Horiuchi further in view of

Sakata even further in view of Nakatsuma. We proceed to




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1999—OOO9
Application O8/648,386

claims 15, 17, 19, and 20.

11. claims 15, 17, 19. and 20

The examiner asserts, “Nakatsuma teaches setting up a mode
such that when the mode is activated, printing of image data
other than the report image data is not allowed, which serves the
same purpose as that of the claimed invention wherein when an
operation mode (the black data reception stop mode) is set and
has been determined activated, printing of other image data is
not allowed.” (Final Rejection at 5.) The appellant argues,
“Uetama does, however desire to print all the black data

received.” (Req. Reh’g at 13.)

are read in light of the specification." limfol Mf . Co. v.

(CCPA 1975)). Here, claims 15, 17, 19, and 20 specify in




*** PAGE 7 ***

image data on said document; printing the image data scanned

(Spec.

The specification describes the black data reception stop
as follows.

Following step 206 of storing received or copied
image data in memory unit 20, central processing
unit 10 detects, step 207, whether a sequential
predetermined number of lines, i.e., a whole page or
half a page of stored image data, is black data. Here,

black data is [sic] intended to be detected by page
unit (e.g., one page), but it can be detected by line
unit (e.g., 3 lines, 5 lines, or more). When central

processing unit 10 determines that the number of lines
of black data stored in memory unit 20 is not more than
the predetermined number of lines, the image data is
read from memory unit 20 and provided to printer 70 to
be printed, step 209, in a normal printing operation.
On the other hand, when central processing unit 10
determines in step 207 that the number of lines of
black data stored in memory unit 20 is more than the
predetermined number of lines, central processing unit
10 proceeds to step 208. In step 208, central
processing unit 10 controls printer 70 to print image
data corresponding to a quarter of one page of stored
image data as black data and the rest as white data.

the limitations require inter alia

Application 08/648,386

deactivating a mode for preventing a facsimile machine from
printing when a predetermined number of sequential lines of black

data have been stored in its memory.

Uetama does not teach a black data reception stop mode that
prevents its facsimile apparatus from printing when a
predetermined number of sequential lines of black data have been
stored in its memory. As explained regarding claims 9, 11-14,
and 22, Uetama prints marginal, compressed data when a
predetermined number of sequential lines of blank data have been

received by the apparatus.

Because Uetama prints marginal, compressed data when a
predetermined number of sequential lines of blank data have been
received, we are not persuaded that the teachings from the
applied prior art would have suggested the limitations of
“determining whether a black data reception stop mode has been
activated while scanning said image data on said document;
printing the image data scanned during said scanning step when
said black data reception stop mode has not been activated.”
Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims 9, 11-14, and 22 as

being obvious over Uetama in view of Horiuchi further in view of




*** PAGE 9 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0009

Sakata even further in view of Nakatsuma. We proceed to

claim 23.

III. Claim 23
A rejection not referred to in an examiner's answer is

assumed to have been withdrawn. Ex parte Emm, 118 USPQ 180, 181
(Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1958) (citing Ex parte Charch, 102 USPQ
363, 364 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1954) and Ex parte Hill, 93 USPQ
45, 46 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1952)). Here, although the examiner
had finally rejected claim 23, (Final Rejection at 2), he neither
repeats nor references the rejection of the claim in his answer.
Therefore, we conclude that the rejection of claim 23 under § 103

has been withdrawn.

In summary, we grant the appellant's request to reverse the
rejection of claims 9, ll—l5, l7, 19, 20, and 22 under § l03(a).
The rejection of claims 1-8, l0, l6, 18, 21, and 23-31 under

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
This is in response to appellant's request that we reconsider our decision mailed
November 26, 2002, wherein we sustained the final rejection of claims 1-24 and 26-36.
However, appellant's arguments fail to convince us that we erred in any respect in the

decision. We therefore decline to make any changes therein.

rehearing. Legal support for substituting one Board member for another can be found in In re Bose Corg.,

*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0034
Application No. 08/568,402

As we noted on page 3 of the opinion, that use of the visual sensors in target
detector 12 (Fig. 1) as described by McGary does not teach monitoring an area by
means of a pilot mera, thereby producing an image of the area, is not an issue in
dispute.

As we pointed out on page 4 of the opinion, McGary teaches that target
movement may be determined using video camera 16 signals alone. Col. 3, ll. 47-49.
As explained in more detail at column 3, lines 4 through 17 of the reference, and
depicted in Figure 2c, ﬁeld of view and focus of camera 16 may provide an image of an
area of interest that includes target box B. System controller 14 (Figure 1) may use
signals directly from the video camera to place the target box in its ﬁeld of view.

Appellant apparently reads the reference as requiring target acquisition in the
ﬁrst instance by use of target detector 12 (Fig. 1), or by requiring potential target data
acquisition by sensors 30 and 32 (Fig. 3), before the image of the area under
surveillance is processed for detennining location of an object of interest in the area.
We do not ﬁnd the more general teaching associated with Figure 1 to be so limited. We
further note that even in McGary's preferred embodiment (Fig. 3), image data produced
by the mera is used for the purpose of initial target acquisition. Col. 5, ll. 5-10.

However, even if the McGary system were to require target acquisition in the first
instance by means of target detection separate from the video camera, appellant has
not shown how the video cameras disclosed by McGary may be excluded from meeting

the requirements of the claimed "pilot camera," as we pointed out on page 5 of the

-2-




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0034
Application No. 08/568,402

opinion. Instant claim 10 is drafted in an open-ended form that does not exclude
acquisition of potential target data by separate sensors and moving a camera into
position for monitoring a particular area of interest E ‘Q the claimed steps of
monitoring, processing, and controlling.

Appellant again argues a point not in dispute, on page 3 of the request, by
arguing that McGary fails to teach monitoring the area by means of a pilot camera
thereby producing an image of the area which is then processed and used to control a
slave camera. As we pointed out on page 5 of the opinion, the rejection relies on the
Paff reference, not the McGary reference, for the teaching of a slave camera. The
rejection offers the teachings of McGary combined with those of Paff, with the result
that Paff's master camera no longer requires a human operator to move the master
camera about the area under surveillance.

To the extent that appellant may hold that Paffs control of slave cameras is not
based on a signal representative of the location of an object of interest, we note that
appellant has not shown error in the examiner's finding that the references would have
suggested implementing the automatic target tracking taught by McGary to the slave
camera control as taught by Paff. We also note that even if one were to maintain Paff's
system for broadcasting the pan and tilt position of the master camera to the slave
cameras, rather than broadcasting position signals directly derived from processing of
the image of the area under surveillance, the slave cameras would track the object
based on a signal representative of the location of the object as required by instant

-3-




*** PAGE 4 ***

Application No. 08/568,402

claim 10, for the reason that the pan and tilt position of the master camera would be
based on the signal representative of the location of the object.

Although appellant's request for rehearing appears to reargue the position set
out in the briefs, rather than stating points believed to have been misapprehended or
overlooked in rendering our decision, we have granted appellant's request to the extent
of reconsidering the decision mailed November 26, 2002. However, we deny the

request with respect to making any changes therein.

Appeal No. 1999-0117
Application O8/702,948

ON BRIEF

Before ABRAMS, STAAB and NASE, Administrative Patent Judges.

STAAB, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Appellant requests rehearing of our decision of September
22, 1999, wherein we (1) affirmed the examiner's final rejection
of claims 6-15 as being based on an original disclosure that
fails to comply with the written description requirement found in

the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112, and (2) dismissed the




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0117
Application 08/702,948

appeal as to finally rejected claims 20 and 22.1 Appellant
requests rehearing only with respect to (1).

As explained on pages 3-4 of our decision, two limitations
added to the claims during prosecution are considered by the
examiner as lacking descriptive support in the application as
originally filed. The first questioned limitation pertains to
the distal end configuration of the implant, while the second
limitation sets forth that the at least one helical channel of
the implant has “closed ends.” Appellant contends that we did
not analyze the original disclosure’s compliance with the written
description requirement according to the test set forth by the
Federal Circuit, but instead created and used our own test.
Specifically, appellant contends that we, in effect, required
that literal support be found in the original disclosure for the
limitations in question.

We have carefully reviewed our decision affirming the
examiner's rejection in light of appellant's request for
rehearing, but find no point that we have misapprehended or

overlooked in arriving at our decision. Accordingly, we decline

1 The appeal as to claims 20 and 22 was dismissed in light
of appellant's statement on page 1 of the brief that the appeal
of these claims was no longer being pursued. These claims should
be canceled. MPEP § 1214.05.

*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0117
Application 08/702,948

to make any change thereto. Although we believe our original
decision adequately treats all the points raised by appellant in
the request for rehearing, we add the following comments for
emphasis.

Throughout the request, appellant criticizes our decision
for its alleged failure to take into account “the role of the
artisan in determining compliance [with the descriptive support
requirement of the first paragraph of § 112]” (request, page 3).
According to appellant, the disclosure in the present application
of tapered ends in the drawings, coupled with appellant's
disclosure of the purpose of the distal ends as being to allow
easy entry into the hole in the bone tissue, and the “presumed
knowledge of a person skilled in the art of patents describing
implants with flat distal ends that allow easy entry into holes”
(request, page 5), would have conveyed to the artisan that

“reasonable variations” of the embodiments of Figs. 6

and 7 [e.g., claimed distal end configurations #3 and

#4] are also embodiments of appellant's invention and

were in the possession of the appellant at the time of

filing of the application, even though there is an

“absence of literal support in the specification for

the claim language.” [Request, page 6.]

Our difficulty with this argument is that it requires

considerable speculation on our part of matters such as the

presumed knowledge of the ordinarily skilled artisan, how the

-3-




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0117
Application O8/702,948

artisan would use such knowledge to interpret appellant's
disclosure, and what the ordinarily skilled artisan would
consider a “reasonable variations” of the embodiments illustrated
in the Figures 6 and 7 embodiments. For example, appellant lists
on page 3 of the request several U.S. Patents, presumably for the
proposition that they demonstrate “the skilled—in—the—art
person's knowledge of patented implants having flat distal ends
that permitted easy entry of the implants into holes."2 It is
not apparent to us that one of ordinary skill in the art would
have understood these patents as teaching that flat distal ends
permit easy entry of implants into holes. In any event, even
assuming that these patents establish this concept as being
generally within the skill in the art, appellant has not
persuasively argued why the artisan would have presumed said
concept to be part of appellant's invention in the present
application. This is especially so in that appellant appears to
teach the opposite, namely, that the distal end of the implant
should be tapered. From our perspective, appellant appears to

ask us to presume as an article of faith that one of ordinary

 

2 To the extent these patents are cited for this purpose,
this is a new point of argument made for the first time in this

request, and is therefore untimely.

skill in the art would understand the presently claimed distal
end configurations #3 and #4 as being “reasonable variations” of
the Figures 6 and 7 embodiments, notwithstanding that they are
not disclosed in the original disclosure. In the absence of some
more convincing line of reasoning or evidence in support of this
position, we decline to do so.

On page 8 of the request, appellant maintains that “[t]he
Board apparently did not recognize appellant's the [sic] claim—6
limitation that is at issue in this appeal as being a means—plus—
function limitation.” The parts of claims 6 and 15 that describe
the shape of the distal end of the implant do not invoke the
sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112 because they do not use the
word “means” in association with any function of the distal end.
Accordingly, appellant's view that the parts of claims 6 and 15
that describe the shape of the distal end of the implant can
somehow be interpreted as being means—plus—function limitations
is not well taken.

Concerning the helical channel “closed end” limitation added
to claim 6 during prosecution, we stand by our determination that
this limitation is not inherently disclosed in the original
disclosure of the present application. Where, as here, the

channel could be configured to have ends that are either both

Application 08/702,948

open, or both closed, or one open and one closed, it is not
apparent to us how one of these possible channel configuration
choices, namely, both closed, is an inherent characteristic of
the helical channel. Nor is it apparent to us that the mere
disclosure of a helical channel, in and of itself, would be
construed by a person skilled in the art as a disclosure of a
channel having both ends closed.

Appellant's request for rehearing is granted to the extent
of reconsidering our decision, but is denied as to making any
change thereto.

LIEBERMAN, Administrative Patent ludgg

REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Pursuant to the provisions of 37 CFR § l.197(b) (1997), appellants have

submitted a timely Request for Rehearing (hereafter "Request") of our Decision dated

October 31, 2002, aflirming the rejection of claims 1, 7, 9 through 1 l, 17 and 18




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0310 2

Application No. 08/225,267

under the judicially created doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting as being
unpatentable over claim 1 of U. 5. Patent 5,487,845.

Appellants request rehearing as the Board has denied consideration of appellants’
declaration under 37 CFR § 1.132. in support of this conclusion, the Board stated that:

in a rejection on the grounds of obviousness-type double patenting an
afﬁdavit under 37 CFR § 1.132 is ineffective to overcome the rejection
except in the instance wherein, the prior art effect of the ﬁrst patent may be
avoided by a showing under 37 CFR § 1.132 that any unclaimed invention
disclosed in the ﬁrst patent was derived from the inventor of the application
before the examiner in which the 35 U.S.C. §§102(e)/ 1 03 (a) rejection
was made. in re Katz 687 F.2d 4-50, 215 USPQ 14- (CCPA 1982). Such

in not the case on the record before us. [Decision, pp. 6-7.]

 

Upon careful reconsideration, we ﬁnd that our reviewing court in at least one
instance has reviewed and considered a Declaration purporting to show unexpected results
to overcome a rejection on the grounds of obviousness-type double patenting. Our
reviewing court considered the Declaration and found that it failed to provide the
unexpected results necessary to rebut the mil @ case of obviousness. E Ii
Q,-gj, 759 F.2d 887, 896-97, 225 USPQ 645, 651-52 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
Accordingly, we hold that under appropriate circumstances a declaration under 37 CFR §
1.132 submitted as a rebuttal to a sustainable rejection on the grounds of obviousness-
type double patenting must be considered.

In rebuttal to our conclusion that the claimed subject matter was an obvious

variation of the invention deﬁned in the claims of the 5,487,845 patent and accordingly,




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0310 3

Application No. 08/225,267

continued protection improperly beyond the date of expiration of the ﬁrst patent, the
appellants request consideration of the Declaration of Plach. it is the appellants’ position
that, ”the mixtures containing the compounds in accordance with the invention have
substantially improved threshold voltages, that is, lower in all cases than the prior art
Example 1.” See Request, p. 5.

Having reviewed the data present, we conclude that the appellants have not met
their burden of showing unexpected results. in re Klosak, 455 F.2d 1077, 1080, 173
USPQ 14, 16 (CCPA 1972). it is not sufﬁcient to assert that the results obtained are
unusual or unexpected. The burden of showing unexpected results rests on those who
assert them.

Upon consideration of the data before us, the Declaration is directed to four
examples containing liquid crystalline compositions, each composition containing a base
mixture of six compounds designated in the Plach Declaration on page 4. With respect to
each of the Examples l to IV, the declarant has measured the clearing points, An and the
threshold voltages V00, 0' 20, and V9010, 20,. it is the appellants’ position that the threshold
voltages of the invention are substantially improved over the prior art voltages. See
Examples ll, ill, and IV wherein the threshold voltages are lower in all cases than that of
prior art Example I. We ﬁnd that the threshold voltages, V00, 0' 20,, in Examples l to IV are
1.56, 1.47, 1.50 and 1.49 respectively. We ﬁnd that the threshold voltages are indeed

lower in Examples ll, ill and IV, the amount of lowering being between 0.06 and 0.09




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0310 4
Application No. 08/225,267

Volts for V0010, 20, and between 0.07 and 0.10 volts for V9010, 20,. There is, however, no
explanation by the declarant why a change lowering the threshold voltage of at most 0.10
volts is signiﬁcant, let alone establishes unusual or unexpected results.

Signiﬁcantly, the appellants, in describing their invention, disclose that, "[t]he
threshold voltages V0010, 20, achieved are generally s 1.8 volts, preferably 3 1.6 volts and
particularly preferably in the range from 1.4 to 1.6 volts, or lower.” See Speciﬁcation,

p. 10, lines 14-17. We, accordingly, conclude that the threshold voltage of Example 1,
representative of the prior art falls within the appellants’ most preferable threshold voltage
range. Furthermore, in the mixture examples present in the Speciﬁcation, only Example A
teaches threshold voltages. The threshold voltages recorded therein are Va‘, 0, 20, = 1.63
and V90, 0' 20, = 2.58. These numbers within the scope of the claimed subject matter far
exceed any of the threshold voltages measured in any of the examples in the Declaration of
Plach.

Based upon the above ﬁndings and analysis, we conclude that the appellants’
assertion that they have obtained substantially improved threshold voltages is unsupported
by the evidence of record and in conﬁict with the teachings found in the Speciﬁcation.

As to the Plach Declaration, we further conclude that the data present in the
Declaration are not commensurate in scope with the degree of protection sought by the
claimed subject matter. Si in re Grasselli, 713 F.2d 731, 743, 218 USPQ 769, 778-

79(Fed. Cir. 1983); ln re Tifﬁn, 448 F.2d 791, 792, 171 USPQ 294, 294 (CCPA




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0310
Application No. 08/225,267

1971). it is well settled that "objective evidence of nonobviousness must be
commensurate in scope with the claims . . . ." (quoting in re Lindner, 457 F.2d 506,
508, 173 USPQ 356, 358 (CCPA 1972)). In re Dill, 604 F.2d 1356, 1361,
202 USPQ 805, 808 (CCPA 1979) ("The evidence presented to rebut a prima facie
case of obviousness must be commensurate in scope with the claims to which it pertains.")

The comparison present in the Declaration is directed to four examples containing
a mixture of 9 to 10 liquid crystal compounds. As the declarant has stated ,

some of the most important requirements to be met by
technically and commercially usable liquid crystalline
mixtures exhibiting a positive dielectric anisotropy for
active matrix liquid-crystal displays are the following:

(a) a broad temperature range of nematic liquid crystalline
mesophase,

(b) a low viscosity which is important for achieving a
short response time,

© a high dielectric anisotropy which is important in
achieving a low threshold voltage,

(d) high values of the voltage holding ratio (HR) even
after high temperature treatment;

THAT until now no single compound has been found
which fulﬁlls all of these requirements; thus , liquid
crystalline dielectrics for electrooptical displays usually

are mixtures of at least three liquid crystalline components,
while technically and commercially used high performance
liquid crystalline dielectrics contain ﬁve to more than ten
such compounds; [Plach Declaration, p. 2.]




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1 999-0310 6

Application No. 08/225,267

As each of the examples in the Declaration contain nine or ten components, and
being cognizant of the appellants statement that mixtures of at least three components are
needed to meet the requirements of the invention, we conclude that a showing of nine or
ten mixed components are not commensurate in scope with the claimed subject matter,
which requires no more than, "a mixture of polar compounds.” See claim 1.

Moreover, as declarant Plach has stated with respect to the above-described
properties that, "each compound exerts an inﬂuence on more than one of the above
mentioned properties; . . . ." and that no single compound fulﬁlls each of these
requirements, how can a single base mixture containing a mixture of 10 compounds be
representative of the prior art as a whole or commensurate in scope with a claim requiring
only two compounds, i.e. , " a mixture.” See the Plach Declaration, p. 2.

Finally, the appellants have argued that, "Example ii is directly comparative with
Example I, but the cyclohexylene compounds have been replaced by the same amount of
the two cyclohexenylene compounds in accordance with the invention.” See Brief, p. 10.
Although the appellants allege that Examples l and ii of the Plach Declaration are a side-by-
side comparison between the claimed invention and the closest prior art, we find that the
declarant has not shown that other than the unsaturation present in the ring, the
compounds are otherwise identical in all respects. Neither the appellants nor the declarant
have explained the acronyms presented with respect to each of the compounds listed as

numbers 1 through 8. See the Plach Declaration, pp. 3 and 4. What is the meaning of 3

Application No. 08/ 225,267

F.F.F, 5F.F.F, 2-F, 3-F, 5-F and 3-OD? in their absence we cannot determine which
moieties are present on each of compounds 1 through 8. Accordingly, we conclude that
there is no appropriate side-by-side comparison between the claimed invention and the
closest prior art.

Based on our consideration of the totality of the record before us, and having
evaluated the i E case of obviousness in view of the appellants’ arguments and
evidence, we conclude that the preponderance of evidence weighs in favor of obviousness

of the claimed subject matter within the meaning of Section 103. Sie in re Oetlker 977

 

F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
in view of the foregoing, the appellants’ Request for Reconsideration has been
granted to the extent of considering the Declaration of Plach of record, but is denied with

respect to making any changes in our prior decision.

HEARD: January 24, 2001

Before THOMAS, HAIRSTON, and LEVY, Administrative Patent Judges.

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on rehearing of our original decision in this appeal dated
February 12, 2001, in which we sustained the rejection of claims 1-24 under 35 U.S.C.
103. Appellant's request for rehearing was filed on April 11, 2001. In this request,
appellant presents arguments only with respect to claim 1, since the statement is made

that all remaining claims 2-24 stand or fall with claim 1 at page 6 of the request.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

Page 7 of appellant's request states that the admitted prior art utilized a single
light emitting element, i.e., a laser diode. This is a more explicit statement as to what
appellant's admitted prior art utilized than we perceived from our original understanding
of the invention in the specification as filed as it pertained to prior art Figure 1.
Appellant presents the view at the bottom of page 8 of the request that the laser diodes
of the admitted prior art ideally printed a document with even toner density throughout
the document due to the use of one laser diode. Appellant also states at page 10 of the
request that in the admitted prior art, it was understood and well known in the art that a
laser printer has high resolution and printed a document with even toner density.
Appellant also characterizes, at the bottom of page 9 of the request, that the problem
associated with the admitted prior art was directed to the amount of toner attached on
the drum during a developing stage being determined by a bias voltage, where the
intensity of this bias voltage was controlled by the user by adjusting a terminal on a
control panel. This is consistent with our understanding from the identiﬁed portions of
the admitted prior art in the speciﬁcation that we noted at the top of page 4 of our
original opinion. The user's changing of the bias voltage was characterized at page 10
of the request as merely changing the density of the toner on the printed document not

the uniformity of the density.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

With respect to appellant's admitted prior art Figure 1, it is stated at the bottom
of page 9 of the specification as filed that the bias voltage generator unit 70 had the
adjusting terminal for adjusting the bias of that circuit. The adjusting terminal was
stated to be well known as a print density select switch on the control panel.

On the other hand, whereas appe||ant’s admitted prior art Figure 1 shows
a clock generator 40 and a dividing unit 50 to feed clocking signals to the data
transmitting unit 10, appellant utilizes a selectable first and second divider circuit in
Figure 3 in part controlled by the mode selector and the data coming in on the bus to
the left of that figure. Additionally, the chopping unit 100 has been added between the
data transmitting unit 10 and the print control unit 20 as shown in Figure 3 as compared
with the prior art Figure 1. As stated in the paragraph bridging pages 3 and 4 of our
original opinion, Figure 1 does not teach at all the claimed chopping means operating in
accordance with the second clock signal, where the chopping means in turn causes the
printing control means to be responsive to that data generated by the chopping means
clause of claim 1. However, it is noted that we did state that the bulk of the subject
matter of independent claim 1 on appeal was shown in prior art Figure 1 including the

data transmitting means clause, substantially all of the printing control means clause




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

except for the responsive language to the chopped data, and the print control means
generating the horizontal sink signal at the end of claim 1 on appeal.

In response to appellant's presentation for the first time in the request for
rehearing further information about what appellant's admit to being in the admitted prior
art Figure 1, as well as what the laser printing arts generally recognize, we have
reconsidered our original opinion but come to the same conclusion as to the
unpatentability of the subject matter of claim 1 within 35 U.S.C. § 103 based upon the
same applied prior art, appe||ant’s admitted prior art Figure 1, in view of Tomita and
Hayashi. In light of the new emphasis presented in the request as outlined earlier, the
importance of the Hayashi reference becomes paramount. Since the admitted prior art
Figure 1 utilizes a laser as a light source for the laser beam of the claim, the
corresponding teachings of Hayashi are more significant than ever. Figures 1A and 1B
of Hayashi correspond to a complete laser imaged electrophotographic printing system,
only part ofwhich is correspondingly shown in appellant's prior art Figure 1.

In contrast to the prior art approach associated with appe||ants’s prior art Figure
1 permitting the user to change the bias voltage of the generator 70, appellant's
disclosed invention in representative Figure 3 takes the approach of controlling the

amount of light illuminating the photosensitive drum by chopping the video data to




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

adjust the density of the printed images by designating or selecting the data deﬁning
the amount of light exposed in accordance with software as set forth in the summary of
the invention at the middle of page 6 of the speciﬁcation as ﬁled. It is stated there that
the sharpness of the printed images may be easily adjusted without adjusting the bias
voltage of the developing unit. This is brought out in more detail in the discussion in the
paragraph bridging pages 13 and 14 of the specification as ﬁled.

In a corresponding manner, the discussion of pertinent portions of Hayashi
indicates a similar approach notwithstanding the focus of Hayashi's invention being to
make his image forming apparatus more responsive to environmental conditions such
as humidity. Even as revealed in the abstract of Hayashi's disclosure, the control
circuitry regulates the amount of light of the exposure apparatus, including operation in
accordance with the output of the humidity detector. This is consistent with the nonnal
operation of the circuitry associated with Hayashi's invention. The printing unit 20 in
Figure 1B operates upon taking the provided image signals from the reader 100 "after
pulse width modulation etc., for driving the laser e|ement." (column 4, lines 40-43). This
is detailed more in the discussion beginning at column 5 associated with Figure 2 and
the corresponding discussion of Figures 16 and 14-1 and 14-2 beginning at column 5,

line 31. At least the discussion at column 6 of Hayashi indicates that the amount light




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

emission from a laser is a function of current supplied to the laser and the pulse
duration that is normally supplied to it anyway. At column 6, lines 27-34 it is stated:
Therefore, in order to obtain the same image density from a same

image signal with a varied amount of laser light emission, it becomes

necessary to regulate the pulse duration in response to the change in the

amount of light emission. This is achieved, in the present embodiment, by

employing a number of binary encoding circuits corresponding to the

number of switched levels of the laser power.

Figure 5 depicts a logical flow chart diagram indicating that the particular choice of laser
power to achieve the desired print density is a function of the CPU controlled clocking
signals (pulse duration or pulse width modulation) provided. Note also in contrast
Hayashi’s prior art statement at column 1, at least at lines 18-29.

In any event, the approach taken in Hayashi appears consistent with that taken
by appe||ant’s disclosed invention in Figure 3, the subject matter of the chopping means
of claim 1 on appeal, and appe||ant’s disclosed approach to control the amount of light
illuminating the photosensitive drum to adjust the density of the printed images.
Hayashi’s approach is comparable to the analogous solutions provided by Tomita for
light emitting diode exposure printing devices. Even though it is for a plurality of light
emitting diode printing elements set forth in an array, Tomita does teach selectability of

pulse signals based on different duty ratios according to the showing in Figure 6 relied

upon by the examiner. The variable duty ratio discussions and showings in Figures 6-9

6




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

are comparable to the pulse width modulation teachings in Hayashi. By selective
application of the pulse signature generator circuit 6 in Figure 6, along with its pulse
signal selection circuitry 7, the chopping means or AND gate array 3 selectively chops
the pixel data presented in shift register 4 before activation by the LED element array 1.
Tomita effectively changes the power levels to the individual light emitting diode
elements in a corresponding manner that Hayashi does so with respect to a laser
emitting element.

To the extent the problems associated with appellant's admitted prior art exist as
disclosed, Hayashi's approach appears to teach the solution of these problems for a

similar, corresponding laser-based imaging device. In a corresponding, analogous

manner, Tomita takes a similar approach for light emitting diode-based printing devices.

In contrast to the appellant's admitted prior art approach in Figure 1 of the user
selecting print density by the use of a selector switch to control the bias voltage to the
developer associated with electrophotographic printing apparatus, both Hayashi and
Tomita take a correspondingly similar approach as to what appellant has done to
effectively control the amount of light illuminating photosensitive drum from the
respective illuminating element, a laser in appellant's admitted prior art Figure 1 and in

Hayashi and light emitting diodes in Tomita. In either case, the density of the printed




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application os/250,770

images is controlled by defining the amount of light exposed to the photosensitive drum
in both secondary references in the corresponding manner as appellant does. In this
light, it appears to us that the applied prior art still addresses the problem as well as the
solution provided by appellant.

To the extent appellant argues that the purposes of the references relied upon
by the examiner are different from the appellant's disclosed purpose, this is not
necessarily pertinent to the issue and is essentially irrelevant if the prior art teachings
would have led the artisan to construct an arrangement having the claimed structural
features. In re Heck, 699 F.2d 1331, 216 USPQ 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and In re Kronig,
539 F.2d 1300, 190 USPQ 425 (CCPA 1976). In re Heck also indicates that the use of

patents as references is not limited to what the patentees described as their own

invention. The law of obviousness does not require that references be combined for
reasons contemplated by an inventor, but only looks to whether the motivation or
suggestion to combine references is provided by prior art taken as a whole. ln_re
Biatti_e, 974 F.2d 1309, 24 USPQ2d 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In an obviousness
detennination, the prior art need not suggest solving the same problem set forth by
appellant. In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692-93, 16 USPQ2d 1897, 1901 (Fed. Cir.
1990)(en banc)(overru|ing in part In re Wright, 848 F.3d 1216, 1220, 6 USPQ2d 1959,

therein.

Application No. 08/807,210

 

ON BRIEF

 

Before GARRIS, WALTZ and PAWLIKOWSKI, Administrative Patent Judges.
GARRIS, A inis r tiv P n

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to a request, filed September 27, 2001,
for a rehearing of our decision, mailed August 31, 2001, wherein
we affirmed the examiner's section 103 rejection of all appealed
claims as being unpatentable over the Japanese reference in view
of Miyaji.

In this request, the appellants reiterate their argument
that Miyaji teaches away from using lubricating or mineral oil in
compositions for two—cycle engines pursuant to the here claimed

invention and accordingly that the examiner's rejection is




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0543
Application No. 08/807,210

improper. Specifically on page 3 of the subject request, the
appellants urge that “the claims cannot stand rejected on the
basis of the Japanese reference in combination with Miyaji in
that Miyaji cannot be used to support the reference since it
clearly teaches in a direction contrary to that achieved in
accordance with appellants’ invention and this contrary teaching
must be given consideration".

We have again carefully evaluated the appellants’ above
noted position giving full consideration to the applied reference
teachings including the particular teachings referred to by the
appellants in their request. In this regard, we recognize the
appellants point out that Miyaji associates cleanliness problems
with the presence of mineral oil in lubricating oil compositions
for two—cycle engines (see lines 28-33, in column 1). As
indicated in our above noted decision, however, Miyaji expressly
discloses using at least some amount of mineral oil in his
lubricating oil composition (see the paragraph bridging columns 3
and 4) and therefore plainly does not teach away from the use of
any and all amounts of mineral oil in compositions of the type
under consideration. Further, as also indicated in our decision,
it is significant that the Japanese reference expressly teaches

the effectiveness of a two—cycle engine oil composition which




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0543
Application No. 08/807,210

contains, for example, 40% by weight of mineral oil (see the
first full paragraph of translation page 3).

For these reasons and those expressed on page 5 of our
decision, we remain convinced that the combined teachings of the
applied references would have suggested a composition of the type
here claimed which includes, for example, 40% by weight of a
lubricating oil (i.e., mineral oil). In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413,
425, 208 USPQ 871, 881 (CCPA 1981) (the test for obviousness is
what the combined teachings of the references would have
suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art).

In addition to the foregoing, it is appropriate to emphasize
that the appellants have not contested in the subject request our
determination on page 6 of the forenoted decision that the

ON BRIEF

Before MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, COHEN and
STAAB, Administrative Patent Judges.

MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has requested a rehearing from a new ground of rejection which we
introduced pursuant to 37 CFR § l.196(b) in our decision mailed January 31, 2001 (Paper
No. 22). In that decision, we reversed the examiner’s rejections of the appealed claims
and, pursuant to the provisions of 37 CFR § 1.196(b), rejected the appealed claims under
the ﬁrst paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112 as being based on a speciﬁcation which, as filed,

does not satisfy the description requirement in that paragraph. We have carefully




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0681

Application No. 08/697,478

considered appellant’s request, but ﬁnd nothing to persuade us that our decision to reject
the appealed claims under the ﬁrst paragraph of § 112 was in error.

In support of our new rejection, we held that there was no descriptive support in
the original speciﬁcation, including the original claims, or the original drawings for the
recitation in claim 1 that the shoulder (18) is “formed on the inside of the conical [sic]
shaped wall,” for the recitation in claims 1, 5 and 14 that the shoulder is formed “at the
second end of the [conical shaped] wall,” and for the recitation in claim 14 that the
shoulder is “formed in the inside surface of the conical [sic] shaped wall” (see pages 8-9
of our decision). Instead, as noted on page 9 of our decision, Figure 2 of appellant’s
drawings shows that the shoulder is formed in an axially extending cylindrical end
portion adjoining a conically shaped wall portion.

Appellant does not challenge our finding that the shoulder is in the cylindrical
wall portion, rather than the adjoining conically shaped wall portion. Instead, appellant
contends that we erred in our rejection by referring to the claimed “conical shaped wall”
as a “conically shaped wall.” In particular, appellant contends that we erred by
interpreting the word “conical” too narrowly as meaning “conical throughout its entire
length” (request for rehearing, page 2).

In this regard, appellant contends on page 2 of his request for rehearing that “the
phase, [sic] ‘conical shaped wall’ must include the cylindrical portion . . .” On page 5 of
the request for rehearing, appellant fu.rtl1er contends that the term “conical” is “broadly
understood in the art to mean an interface between a pipe and a catalytic converter” with
the result that it may include shapes other than the dictionary meaning of the word

“conical.” As we understand appellant’s position, a “conical shaped wall” differs from a




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0681

Application No. 08/697,478

“comically shaped wall” in that it may include shapes other than comical shapes, namely a
cylindrical shape. We do mot agree with this interpretation. Moreover, it is not supported
by appellant’s speciﬁcation as ﬁled.

In our decision, we never intimated that the appealed claims literally recite a
“comically shaped wall.” We did, however, refer to the claimed “conical shaped wall” as
a “comically shaped wall” because the expression “conical shaped wall” is grammatically
imco1rect.1 In this regard, the word “conical” is an adjective amd therefore may only serve
to modify a noun or a pronoun. However, the word “shaped” is Q a noun or a pronoun,
but instead is the verb “shape” in the past tense. Therefore, the use of the adverb
“comically” is grammatically appropriate for modiﬁng the verb “shaped” in the past
temse.2 In short, the words “conical” amd “comically” are modiﬁers amd, in substance,
mean the same thing, the only difference being a grammatical ome.

Furthermore, we disagree with appellant’s comtemtiom om page 2 of the request for
rehearing that the dictionary deﬁnition for the word “comical” is broad enough to
encompass shapes other tham conical shapes. According to its dictiomary deﬁnition,3 the
word “comica ” is defined as resembling or having the shape of cone (which comports
with appellant’s proposed dictionary deﬁnition). By definition, therefore, “comica ”

excludes shapes (e.g., cylimdrical shapes) other than shapes resembling a come. In short, a

cylindrical shape does not resemble a cone and thus may not be construed as having a
conical shape.4

Furthermore, appellant has not introduced sufﬁcient evidence to establish that the
adjective “conical” or its adverbial counterpart “conically” has acquired a meaning in the
catalytic converter art to include cylindrical shapes or other non- conical shapes. With
regard to the cited Nara et al. Patent No. 4,279,864, the “[c]onverged ends 32a and 32b”
(column 1, line 21) are shown to be separate from the conical pipes 3a and 3b. Figure 3
of this patent does not relate to the prior art converter of Figure 1. Instead, Figure 3
illustrates a sealing member for the Nara et al. invention. Even if the term “conical” was
used in a misdescriptive sense in the Nara et al. patent to include “converged” (whatever
that may mean) ends or “diverged” ends, such misuse in a single patent does not establish
that “conical” is typically used in the catalytic converter art to include a cylindrical shape.
The Nara et al. patent is equivocal at best.

We are not unmindful of appellant’s reliance on In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048,
1054-55, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027 (Fed Cir. 1997). However, this case supports our
position, not appellant’s position.

In Mojn'is, 127 F.3d at 1056, 44 USPQ2d at 1029 the court observed that, with
regard to the claim language in issue, the appellant failed to make his intended meaning
“explicitly clear” (emphasis added). The i court went on to hold that interpreting
the claim language in light of the Morris patent speciﬁcation was of no avail to the

appellant because the speciﬁcation failed to set forth the deﬁnition now sought by the

4 In this context the word “shape” is used as a noun. It therefore is grammatically correct
to use the modiﬁer “conical.”




*** PAGE 5 ***

Application No. 08/697,478

appellant. L1. The same is true in the case at bar. Appellant’s speciﬁcation does not
make it clear that the expression “conical shaped wall” may include a cylindrical shape or
other non-conical shapes.

Accordingly, the expression “conical shaped wall” must be given its ordinary and
accustomed meaning. E Lantech, Inc. v. Keip Machine Company, 32 F. 3d 542, 547,

31 USPQ2d 1666, 1670 (Fed. Cir. 1994). See also Cortland Line Co. v. Orvis Co. 203

 

F.3d 1351, 1356, 53 USPQ2d 1734, 1737 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (“Claim terms receive their
ordinary and customary meaning unless the patentee assigns a special meaning”). The
ordinary and accustomed dictionary meaning of “conical” in the expression “conical
shaped wall” excludes cylindrical and other non-conical shapes. Therefore, the original
speciﬁcation as ﬁled lacks descriptive support for the claim limitations discussed in our
§ 112, ﬁrst paragraph, rejection of the appealed claims as set forth in our decision dated
January 31, 2001.
In light of the foregoing, appellant’s request for rehearing is granted to the extent

of reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to making any change thereto.

ON BRIEF

 

Before SCHAFER, LEE and MEDLEY, Administrative Eatent Judges.
LEE, 

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

On May 14, 2001, we issued a decision affirming the
examiner's rejection of appellants’ claims 13, 15 and 17-20.
(Paper No. 16). On June 14, 2001, the appellants filed a

request for rehearing. For reasons explained below, the

request is DENIED.

In the first paragraph on page 2, the appellants state

that “required findings are absent from the Board's decision.”

Application ior patent filed November 18, 1996.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1095
Application O8/751,632

However, nowhere does the appellants point out what findings
we allegedly failed to make. Evidently, the appellants simply
disagree with the findings we did make. In the full paragraph
on the middle of page 5 of the decision, and in response to
the appellants’ argument in the appeal brief that Ennis ‘429
does not teach use of a coloring agent in the sense of the
appellants’ invention because the coloring pigment of Ennis
‘429 has no color that is described, we specifically found
that Ennis ‘429 discloses use of a coloring agent as has been
claimed:

Ennis ‘429 generally refers to the addition of a

coloring pigment without particularly specifying the

color. That would have indicated to one with

ordinary skill in the art that the particular

coloring is not important, and that whatever color

is used would be fine so long as the light

transmissivity of the coloring pigment is between

that of water and oil. None of this makes Ennis

‘429's coloring pigment not a coloring agent. That

the coloring pigment in Ennis ‘429 is used for

changing light transmissivity and not so much for

providing a color does not disqualify it from being
a coloring agent. (Emphasis added.)

In the request for rehearing, the appellants re—present
the same argument which we have rejected, only in different
words:

As mentioned previously, the critical test for a §
103 rejection is whether Ennis ‘429 teaches or

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1095
Application O8/751,632

suggests to one skilled in the art the use of a

coloring agent for the present invention. Applicant

respectfully assert that no suggestion is made

within Ennis ‘429 that the use of coloring agents is

obvious for techniques that don't require coloring

agents in order to function, but rather merely to

help to improve the technique. (Emphasis in

original).
The argument is also not commensurate in scope with what the
appellants have claimed. The claims on appeal do not limit
the purpose or need for which a coloring agent is used or the
degree of such purpose or need. For instance, independent
claim 13 recites merely the following with respect to a
coloring agent: “displacing and replacing the wellbore fluid
in said selected interval of a borehole with a transparent
water mixture having a viscosifying gent, a coloring agent,
and optionally sufficient salt to increase the mixture
density.”

The request for rehearing is also not an opportunity for

a dissatisfied appellants to introduce new arguments for the

first time, i.e., arguments not presented in the appeal brief.

Accordingly, all of the arguments contained in the rehearing
request concerning unexpected results are improper and not
entitled to consideration. In any event, the appellants have

not submitted objective evidence in the form of declarations

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. l999—lO95
Application O8/751,632

in connection with the belated argument of unexpected results.

Finally, the appellants take exception to a statement
which they assert the examiner made but which the examiner did
not make. In that regard, on page 4 of the request for
rehearing it is stated:

Applicant also assert that the Examiner's
unsubstantiated statement that viscosifying agents
are solely intended to prevent charge material from
being driven into the underground formation (see
Board decision, p. 8) overlooks the nonobvious
results produced by this invention. (Emphasis
addedJ

Our initial decision on page 8 did not indicate any examiner
statement which regard viscosifying agents as “solely”
intended to prevent charge material from being driven into the
underground formation. What was stated in our decision is
this:

With regard to Ennis ‘889, the examiner's answer
states that the disclosed functionality of a
viscosifying agent to prevent a charging material
from being driven into the underground formation is
equally applicable to the combination of Riordan and
Ennis ‘429. The finding is facially plausible.
Furthermore, in the examiner's answer, on page 5, it
is stated that “the use of such ‘viscosifying
agents’ is notoriously well known in the wellbore
exploration art for this very purpose.” The
appellants have not filed any reply to the
examiner's answer. Thus, the statement of the
examiner as to what is notoriously well known in the
art stands unrebutted.




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1095
Application O8/751,632

In any event, it is too late to be challenging, in a request
for rehearing, findings made by the examiner in the examiner's
answer, where no reply was filed to rebut the finding. An
adverse decision is not an invitation for new arguments.
Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the request for rehearing is
DENIED.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

§ l.l36(b).

Appeal No. 1999-1256
Application 08/333,076

ON BRIEF

Before WILLIAM F. SMITH, ADAMS, and GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judges.

GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Appellants request rehearing and reconsideration of the board's decision entered
July 30, 2001, wherein the examiner's rejection of claims 31 and 32 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 112, first paragraph, was atfirmed.

In effect, Appellants assert that the board applied the wrong legal standard in
reviewing the rejection for nonenablement. See page 2, first full paragraph (“App|icants,
however, in order to provide an enabling disclosure, need not demonstrate how
embryonic stem cells can be made to differentiate into every desirable cell type.”);ﬁ,

last paragraph (“[0]ne need not show the culturing of embryonic stem cells in the




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1256
Application No. 08/333,076

differentiation culture medium in the presence of every agent which promotes
differentiation of the embryonic stem cells into every desired cell type."); and page 3
("[|]t is not necessary that Applicants culture embryonic stem cells in the presence of
every agent and every medium which would promote differentiation of the embryonic
stem cells into everydesired cell type.").

Appellants analogize the instant claims to an invention “directed to the culture
conditions for expression of recombinant protein in a certain cell.’' Page 2, second full
paragraph. They argue that, in such a case, “the inventor need not enable one skilled in
the art to express a wide variety of proteins in order to be entitled to coverage of the

inventive culture conditions for expression." E

To the extent that Appellants urge that the board applied an incorrect standard of
enablement to the claims on appeal, we disagree. The appropriate legal standard for
determining enablement was discussed and applied on pages 7-8 of the decision

entered July 30, 2001, which states:

The specification discloses no agents that promote differentiation of
embryonic stem cells into cell types other than neuronal cells and muscle
cells. In addition, the specification states that the prior art does not
disclose any agents that promote differentiation of embryonic stem cells
into a particular cell type. See page 2 (“Differentiation of stem cells into a
homogeneous population, however, has not been achieved.").

Thus, the specification lacks working examples or detailed guidance
concerning the range of differentiation-promoting agents encompassed;
the scope of the claims encompasses using any differentiation promoting
agent to produce any type of cell; the prior art provides no guidance
regarding producing a specific cell type from embryonic stem cells; and
neither the prior art nor the specification provides any basis on which to
predict what type of cell will result from treatment with a given agent.

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1256
Application No. 08/333,076

Thus, on this record, it appears that the full scope of claims 31 and 32
could only be practiced by those skilled in the art who carried out the very

considerable experimentation necessary to identify agents that promote
differentiation of embryonic stem cells into each of the different types of

possible differentiated cells.

Therefore, based on the factors set out in In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737,

8 USPQ2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988), and despite the high level of skill

in the art, we conclude that practicing the full scope of claims 31 and 32

would require undue experimentation. We therefore affirm the rejection of

claims 31 and 32 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph.
Thus, as the decision itself makes clear, we applied the standard of enablement set out
in In re Wands and agreed with the examiner’s conclusion that undue experimentation

would have been required to practice the full scope of claims 31 and 32. The Wands

factors are an appropriate framework for analyzing enablement. See, e.g., Enzo

Biochem Inc. v. Calgene Inc., 188 F.3d 1362, _, 52 USPQ2d 1129, 1136 (Fed. Cir.
1999)

As for Appellants’ “analogous example," we disagree that the instant claims are
analogous to an invention “directed to culture conditions for expression of recombinant
protein in a certain cell.'' Such conditions would be expected to be similar regardless of
the specific heterologous protein being expressed by the cell. In the instant claims, by
contrast, the particular agent that is added to the differentiation culture medium
determines what type of cells the embryonic stem cells differentiate into: different
agents would be required to induce the embryonic stem cells to differentiate into each
type of differentiated cell (muscle cells, nerve cells, hematopoietic cells, skin cells, islet

cells, liver cells, etc.). Appellants’ example is therefore unhelpful to their case.




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1256
Application No. 08/333,076

We have carefully reviewed the original opinion in light of Appellants’ request, but
we find no point of law or fact which we overlooked or misapprehended in arriving at our
decision. To the extent it is relevant, Appellants’ request amounts to a reargument of
points already considered by the board. For the reasons discussed in the decision of
July 30, 2001, we decline to reverse the examiner's rejection of claims 31 and 32 on the
basis of nonenablement.

Appellants’ request has been granted to the extent that the decision has been
reconsidered, but such request is denied with respect to making any modifications to

the decision affirming the examiner's rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph.

ON BRIEF

Before ROBINSON, SCHEINER, and MILLS, Administrative Patent Judges.
ROBINSON, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests reconsideration (rehearing) of the board's decision entered
January 30, 2001, wherein the examiner's rejection of the appealed claims under 35
U.S.C. § 103 was affirmed.

In effect, appellant's request is premised upon assertions that the board failed to
consider and properly weigh the evidentiary relevance of Green, failed to disclose a
basis for affirming the rejection as to claim 15 and applied an improper standard with

regard to appellant's allegation of unexpected cost savings.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1331
Applition No. 08/547,602

We would, initially, note that appellant is correct concerning the typographical
error page 4, second sentence which refers to "L-fuculose isomerase" rather the correct
term "fucose isomerase."

To the extent that appellant presents arguments with respect to the deficiency of
Green as to whether the description should be read as describing a fucose isomerase,
we would note that these arguments were not presented in this manner in either the
Appeal Brief or the Reply Brief. We would note that appellant had raised a similar
argument in the paragraph bridging pages 4-5 of the response filed July 8, 1997 (Paper
No. 7). It would appear that this argument was directed to the patentability of at least
claim 1, which was pending in the application at that time, and which required the use of
a puriﬁed L-fucose isomerase. That limitation is not present in the claims currently
pending in this application. However, the examiner responded to this argument at
pages 3-4 of the Ofﬁce action of October 20, 1997 (Paper No. 8) stating :

[t]he cell-free extract disclosed by Green is encompassed by the claim

language "purified" present in claim 1. It is respectfully submitted that

unless it is clear from reading the speciﬁcation that the word "puriﬁed" is

intended to have such a meaning, the language "puriﬁed" does not mean

that the enzyme is purified to homogeneity, or by a particular process,

unless the claims so recite. Note that the examples in the speciﬁcation all

use "crude extract" (820 Units/ml) of L-fucose isomerase. See

specification at pages 27 (line 6), page 28 (line 11), page 29 (lines 13 and

14). Note also that claim 12 does not recite that the enzyme is puriﬁed.

Thus, the language "puriﬁed" in claim 1 does not distinguish the claimed
process from that suggested by the cited prior art.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1331
Application No. 08/547,602

Appellant did not renew these arguments, or take issue with the examinefs conclusion
stated in the Final Rejection, in either the Brief or Reply Brief. Thus, these arguments
are not properly before us. 37 CFR § 1.192(a)(1998)("Any arguments or authorities not
included in the brief will be refused consideration by the Board of Patent Appeals and
interferences, unless good cause is shown").

As to the basis for affirmation of the rejection of claim 15, we refer to that portion
of the decision of January 30, 2001 appearing at page 7, first full paragraph which
addresses appealed claim 15, specifically.

As to appellant's arguments concerning the standard applied with respect to the
allegation of unexpected cost savings, we are not persuaded that the standard applied
in our decision of January 30, 2001 was erroneous. To the extent that appellant would
seek to compare the present claimed process to a "hypothetical process" (Request,
page 6), it naturally follows that any comparison of cost savings would of necessarily be
hypothetical and of little persuasive value. We would remind appellant that as set forth
in In re Wright, 999 F.2d 1557, 1563, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1514-15 (Fed. Cir. 1993),
evidence which is in the nature of unsupported conclusory statements as to the ultimate
legal question is entitled to little if any weight.

We have carefully reviewed the original opinion in light of appellant's request, but
we find no point of law or fact which we overlooked or misapprehended in arriving at our
decision. To the extent relevant, appellant's request amounts to a reargument of points

already considered by the board.




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1331

Therefore, appellant's request has been granted to the extent that the decision

modifications to the decision affirming the examiner's rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal

may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph. Appellants seek rehearing only
of our affirmance of the examiner's decision to reject claims
3 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

Appellants’ request (page 1) contends that the Board
wrongly characterized the rollers of Rhorer and Goettsch as
resilient anilox rollers in the earlier decision. However,
appellants have failed to clearly articulate a definition of
resilient anilox roller or “anilox roller having a resilient
transfer surface” (the language used in claims 3 and 23) which
distinguishes over the Rhorer and Goettsch rollers. The only
structural feature of an “anilox” roller set forth in
appellants’ specification is that “[t]he surface of an anilox
roller is engraved with an array of closely spaced, shallow
depressions referred to as ‘cells’” (page 12). From this, the
Board interpreted an “anilox roller” as “an applicator roller
having a surface engraved with an array of closely spaced,
shallow depressions" (decision, page 4). For the reasons set

forth on page 15 of the earlier decision, it is our view that

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. l999—l348
Application No. 08/435,798

the rollers disclosed by Rhorer and Goettsch are anilox
rollers having a resilient transfer surface in accordance with
this interpretation.

To the extent that appellants are attempting to define
“anilox roller" on page 2 of the request, this attempt is
unavailing. First, appellants provide neither a precise nor a
consistent definition of “anilox roller.” On page 2, in lines
7-8 of the request, appellants state that “[a]nilox rollers
are well known as a term of art in the printing industry for
metering rollers having the entire surface covered uniformly
with fine ink holding cells." In that the rollers of Rhorer
and Goettsch are covered uniformly with fine ink holding
cells, they would appear to meet such a definition. On page
2, in lines l4—l6 of the request, appellants urge that
“Exhibits A, B and C taken from a commercial web site
(pamarcotech.com) evidence generic use of the term ‘anilox’ to
describe uniformly patterned steel or ceramic metering
rollers.” While there is an Exhibit C attached to appellants’
request, Exhibits A and B are not attached. In any event,
appellants had the opportunity to present evidence as to the

definition of “anilox roller" prior to the Board's earlier

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1348
Application No. 08/435,798

decision and elected not to do so.2 Accordingly, we decline
to consider such evidence upon rehearing, especially where the
evidence, as in the case of Exhibit C, does not expressly
define the term at issue.3
Moreover, even if we were to combine the two statements

on page 2 of appellants’ request mentioned supra, and give
“anilox roller" a narrow definition consistent with both of
these statements, namely, a uniformly patterned steel or
ceramic metering roller having the entire surface covered
uniformly with fine ink holding cells, we must not lose sight
of the fact that the terminology used in appellants’ claims 3
and 23 is “anilox roller having a resilient transfer surface.”
Stated differently, according to appellants, the roller
recited in the claims clearly differs from a conventional
prior art anilox roller in that the recited roller has a

resilient transfer surface. As the Rhorer and Goettsch

2 37 CFR § 1.195 provides that “[a]affidavits, declarations, or exhibits
submitted after the case has been appealed will not be admitted without a
showing of good and sufficient reasons why they were not earlier presented."

3 At best, Exhibit C evidences that at least one anilox roller on the
market includes a laser engraved ceramic outer coating over an aluminum layer.
This product description is ineffective to establish that all anilox rollers
have these features.




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1348
Application No. 08/435,798

rollers have resilient transfer surfaces, rather than hard
steel or ceramic surfaces on which the cell pattern is fixed,
they appear to respond structurally to the claim limitations.

The only argument offered in appellants’ request as to
why the Rhorer and Goettsch rollers are not resilient anilox
rollers is that they are “rubber printing rollers" (request,
page 1). From our perspective, the distinction argued by
appellants is directed to the intended use of the roller, not
to the actual structure of the roller, and thus cannot be
relied upon for patentability. It is well settled that the
recitation of an intended use for an old product does not make
a claim to that old product patentable. In re Schreiber, 128
F.3d 1473, 1477, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

As a final observation with regard to whether or not the
Rhorer and Goettsch rollers are an “anilox roller having
resilient transfer surfaces" as claimed by appellants, we note
that, in response to the examiner's enablement rejection,
appellants (brief, page 7) pointed to the examiner's citation
of the Rhorer and Goettsch references as prior art disclosing
such a roller to support the conclusion that one of ordinary

skill in the art would be aware of such a roller (i.e., an




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1348
Application No. 08/435,798

anilox roller having a resilient transfer surface). This
statement implies a concession by appellants that the Rhorer
and Goettsch rollers are anilox rollers having a resilient
transfer surface.

Appellants also add a new argument that, in essence,
there is no suggestion or teaching or reason to modify Bird as
proposed by the examiner because, if a skilled artisan were to
use a roller of the type disclosed by Rhorer or Goettsch in
Bird, such an artisan would replace the plate cylinder 19b and
relief plate 20b, not the applicator roller 33, with such a
roller (request, page 3). This argument was not presented by
appellants in either their brief or reply brief. In fact,
with regard to the examiner's obviousness rejection of claims
3 and 23, and the substitution of the roller of either Rhorer
or Goettsch for the applicator roller 33 of Bird in
particular, appellants’ sole argument was a glib statement
that the examiner's position was inconsistent with the
rejection of claims 3 and 23 under the first paragraph of 35
U.S.C. § 112 (brief, page 10). Appellants’ attempt to
belatedly present such a new argument is unavailing, since a

new argument advanced in a request for rehearing, but not

6




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. l999—l348
Application No. 08/435,798

advanced in appellants’ brief, is not properly before the
Board and will not be considered.4

As should be evident from our discussion above,
appellants’ request for rehearing has been reviewed and the
request granted to the extent of our reconsidering our earlier
decision in light thereof, but is denied with respect to
making any changes in that decision.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in

connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

§ l.l36(a).

Before KRASS, DIXON and BARRY, Administrative Patent Judges.

KRASS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants ﬁled a “Request for consideration“ on January 10, 2002, wherein
appellants requested that we consider that part of our decision of September 27, 2001
in which we remanded the case back to the examiner and to appellants for more

information regarding the rejection of claims 53-98 over 35 U.S.C. § 103. In particular,

‘More properly termed a “Request for Rehearing.”




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1548
Application No. 08/859,629

we asked the parties to deﬁne and identify what a “planarization” layer is meant to cover

and why the applied references were deemed to suggest or not suggest such a

“planarization” layer.

Based on remarks received from appellants (Paper No. 44) and the examiner
(Paper No. 45), we issued a supplemental decision on July 29, 2002 (Paper No. 46),

wherein we sustained the rejection of claims 53-59, 62-64, 86-92 and 94-98 under 35
U.S.C. § 103, but we did not sustain the rejection of claims 60, 61, 65-85 and 93 under

35 U.S.C. § 103. Our reasons are adequately set forth in Paper No. 46, and we need

not repeat them here.

While appellants’ request for reconsideration of January 10, 2002 (Paper No. 47)
was ﬁled prior to our supplemental decision, it was entered into the file subsequent to

our supplemental decision, and we did not have the beneﬁt of it when reaching our

decision of July 29, 2002.

However, we have now reviewed that request for reconsideration and ﬁnd that it
does not differ from the request for reconsideration made in Paper No. 44. Since we
have already treated any such arguments and/or comments by appellants in our

supplemental decision, and appellants have not convinced us of any error in our




*** PAGE 3 ***

supplemental decision of July 29, 2002, we deny appellants’ request for

reconsideration.

may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

In the original decision and supporting opinion entered on January 30, 2002, we
reversed two rejections and vacated a third. It is the latter action which appellants

request rehearing. Specifically, appellants ask:

1 Senior Administrative Patent Judge (SAPJ) McKe|vey served on the merits
panel which rendered the original decision in this appeal. Subsequent thereto, SAPJ
McKe|vey retired from the USPTO. Accordingly, Vice Chief Administrative Patent
Judge Harkcom has been designated as a member of the merits panel to decide this

*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1686 Page 2
Application No. 08/552,206

A. If the PTO insists on this law-based approach to solve its Markush
claim problem, it is requested that the Board withdraw its remand,
reinstate the examiner's Markush rejection after considering the
additional facts outlined below and permit applicants to appeal to
the Federal Circuit so that the patent community can get that
court's first take on this issue.

B. Alternatively, if the Board prefers, it is respectfully submitted, to
respect clear precedent, then, it is requested that it withdraw its
remand, confirm the propriety of appellant's [sic] Markush group,
and leave it to the director to establish a fair procedure to limit
unreasonable searching burdens caused by Markush claims.

We decline to take either action.

As explained at page 12 of our original opinion, "[r]ather than reverse the
rejection, we believe it more appropriate to vacate the rejection and remand the
application to the examiner for fact-finding in the ﬁrst instance with respect to the
Markush issue." We then set forth certain factors which we believe relevant in
detennining whether a Markush group is proper. As made clear at page 20 of our
opinion "nothing in this opinion should be construed as precluding a further rejection of
the claims based on (1) an improper Markush or other group or (2) prior art uncovered
as a result of an examination on the merits of the R‘ embodiments of claim 1 which are
not phenyl embodiments, matters on which we express no opinion on the merits"
(emphasis added).

The substance of appellants’ request takes issue with our observations
concerning factors which may be relevant in determining whether a Markush group is
proper. We decline to reinstate the examiner’s rejection as requested because, as set

forth in detail in our original opinion, the examiner failed to make appropriate ﬁndings of

fact to support such a rejection. In making our observations in regard to improper




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1686 Page 3
Applition No. 08/552,206

Markush groups, we made clear that we were not making such findings but, rather,
delineating factors which may prove helpful in resolving the issue. What is needed is a
reasoned exchange of views by the examiner and applicants in the context of an e_x
ite examination/prosecution, not in the context of a request for rehearing in an appeal
proceeding before this board.

Nor do we find appellants’ proposed alternative relief that we "conﬁrm the
propriety of appellants‘ Markush group" appropriate. Again, as explained in our original
opinion, we believe there is a substantive issue in this application concerning whether
the Markush group set forth in the claims on appeal is proper. By vacating the
examiner's rejection and remanding the application to the examiner to further consider
the issue, appellants will have their "day in court" in front of the examiner in the context
of an agar‘; examination where this issue can be fully explored. Any further action in
this application by the examiner will undoubtedly take into account the views expressed
by appellants in their request for rehearing before this board. It may be that the
examiner will detennine that the claims do not contain an improper Markush group
which would end the matter. On the other hand, if the examiner does determine that
the claims contain an improper Markush group, he will undoubtedly reopen prosecution
and institute such a rejection in a manner which provides appellants a full and fair
opportunity to respond. It is only after such a reasoned exchange of views that this
board will be in a position to ﬁnally determine the matter.

We have carefully reviewed appellants‘ request for rehearing but decline to
change our decision in any manner.

Application No. 08/615,836

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, BARRETT, and GROSS, Administrative Patent Judges}
THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE§ QUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has requested that we reconsider our July 16, 2002 decision, wherein we afﬁrmed
the final rejection of claims 1-19.
Appellant argues that the Board has overlooked or n1isapprehended binding Board precedent

regarding the non—compliance of the brief and the grouping of claims (Request at pages 4-7) and

1 For purposes of rendering this decision, Administrative Patent Judge Gross has been
substituted for Administrative Patent Judge Lall, who retired subsequent to the original opinion.
E In re Bose, 772 F.2d 866, 227 USPQ 1 (Fed. Cir. 1985) and MPEP § 1203.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2021
Application No. 08/615,836

that the Board has overlooked or misapprehended substantive facts regarding the factual teaching of
the cited references and the controlling law regarding the use of hindsight (Request at pages 7-16).
For

the reasons stated below, we are of the view that our prior decision is justiﬁed and we are not
persuaded by the arguments presented by appellant in the Request for Rehearing to make any
changes therein.

Specifically, appellant argues (Request at page 4) that:

Based on holdings set forth in the Ex Parte Schier and Ex Parte
Ohsumi decisions, and pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 1.192(d) (footnote
omitted), this case must be remanded back to the Examiner and the
Appellant must be given an opportrmity to address any ﬁndings of
non—compliance by the Examiner.

We have reviewed the facts in the J and ﬁg’ and find that the facts of this case are
different from the facts in those cases. In both of those cases, appellant had presented in the body
of the brief arguments regarding the individual claims. The issue was whether the board should
consider the individual arguments even though appellant’s grouping of the claims was inconsistent
with the individual arguments presented in the body of the brief. The Board disallowed the
consideration of the individual arguments in view of the special circumstances of the Schier case,
whereas the Board allowed the individual arguments in the Ohsunri case because the Board held
that the intent of appellant was to argue the claims individually even though the grouping was not

consistent with the arguments. In the present case, appellant has not presented any arguments

regarding the individual claims other than the conclusory statements made on page 11 of the brief.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2021
Application No. 08/615,836

We cited authority on page 5 of ou.r decision that if the claims are not argued individually, the
Board is not under duty to treat them individually. We refer appellant to our decision on this issue
at pages 5 and 6 of our decision.

Regarding the examiner’s responsibility regarding the propriety of the grouping of claims,
we quote below the requirements for an examiner’s answer from the Manual of Patent Examining
Procedures (MPEP) § 1208 as follows:

Grouping of Claims. A statement of whether the examiner disagrees
with any statement in the brief that certain claims do not stand or fall
together, and, if the examiner disagrees, an explanation as to why
those claims are not separably patentable.

Even assuming that we go along with the examiner’s observation that the claims do not
stand or fall together and that the examiner considered the conclusory statement made on page 11 of
the brief as sufficient to appear consistent with the reasons for arguing the claims individually, it is
ultimately the Board’s responsibility to determine the propriety of the arguments regarding the
individual claims. We ﬁnd that the statements made on page 11 of the brief are merely conclusory
and there are no substantive arguments presented by appellant regarding the individual claims listed
on page 11. The examiner on the other hand has given a N1 L case of obviousness for claims
2, 5, 9, 12, 14 and 18 listed on page 11 of the brief at pages 5 and 6 of the examiner’s answer.

Since appellant has not given any rebuttal to those rejections, we find that there are no individual

arguments Q’ the patentability of those claims.




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2021
Application No. 08/615,836

In either case, our previous treatment of claims 1 through 19 as a single group was justiﬁed
and did not constitute an error.

Next, appellant argues (Request at page 11) that “[a]lso, the Board admits that the Examiner
used hindsight to support his rejections and holds that it is lawful to use ‘permissible hindsight’ to
combine teachings from different references.”

Appellant further quotes from our decision at page 8 that:

Appellant respectfully submits that controlling case law was
misapprehended and not applied by the Board when it stated “an artisan,
with permissible hindsight, wo11ld have been motivated to modify Arshi

with the use of Guttag to free the main processor with some of the processing
graphics.”

We disagree with the appellant’s characterization of our quote. Ou.r reference to hindsight
ir1 that quotation was based on the following quotation from In re McLaughlin, infra:

However, “[a]ny judgement on obviousness is in a sense necessarily a
reconstruction based on hindsight reasoning, but so long as it takes
into account only knowledge which was within the level of ordinary
skill hr the art at the time the claimed invention was made and does
not include lcnowledge gleaned only from applicant’s disclosure, such
a reconstruction is proper.” In re McLaughlin 443 F.2d 1392, 1395,
170 USPQ 209, 212 (CCPA 1971).

Therefore, we agree with the examiner’ s rationale for combining the two references as stated
hr the examiner’s answer at page 5 and hi our decision on page 8.

Appellant further argues (Request at pages 9 to 14) that neither Arshi nor Guttag teaches the

partitioning of the speciﬁc steps of the video decoding between the hardware and the software as

claimed. We make reference to our decision at pages 6, 7 and 8 where we discuss ir1 detail the




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2021
Application No. 08/615,836

justiﬁcation for making the combination of Arshi and Guttag to meet the recited limitations. For a
further clariﬁcation of our explanation in our decision, we first would like to point out that claim 1,
the representative claim, is a method claim and does not call for the structure limitations discussed
in the Request for Rehearing. Furthermore, Arshi does show a processor which extracts the motion
vectors and does perform the decompressing of the video data as noted by the examiner. Guttag on
the other hand, does show in Figure 2 a master processor 60 (that can be considered as the main
processor) which controls the graphics coprocessors 71-74. Therefore, to the extent of features
claimed in the method claim 1, the examiner's position of combining Arshi with Guttag is proper
and meets the recited limitation.

For the reasons stated above, we are not persuaded by appe]1ant’s arguments in the Request
for Rehearing to the extent that our decision needs any modification to be made therein.

Accordingly, appel1ant’s request has been granted to the extent that our decision has been




*** PAGE 6 ***

considered, but such request is denied with respect to making any modiﬁcations to the decision.
No time period for taldng any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended
under 37 CFR § l.l36(a).

Appeal No. 1999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

ON BRIEF

Before SMITH, LALL, and BLANKENSHIP, Administrative Patent Judges.
LALL, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests that we reconsider our decision of May 6,
2002, wherein we sustained, under 35 U.S.C. § 103, the rejection
of claims 1, 4-9, 16, 17, 39, 41-43, 45-47, 49-51, 53, 54, 63, 64
and 66 over Smith and Kikinis; the rejection of claims 21-27, 55,
56, 58-60, 62, 67 and 70-74 over Smith, Kikinis and Kenny; and of
claims 28 and 29 over Smith, Kikinis and Gephardt; however, we did
not sustain the rejection of claims 3, 10, 18 and 30-38 over Smith

and Kikinis.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

Appellant argues that we have overlooked some points (19
as enumerated on pages 2-4 of the rehearing request) argued in
Appellant's brief while rendering said decision.

We have reconsidered our decision of May 6, 2002 in light of
Appellant's comments in the request for reconsideration and we find
an error with respect to claims 59, 60, 62, 63, 64 and 66, which
corresponds to item numbers 6, l5, l6 and 17 of the request for
rehearing. However, we find no error in our decision regarding the
remaining claims. We therefore modify our decision accordingly.
Our response to the various points raised in the request for
rehearing is as follows.

Regarding the items 1-4 of the request for rehearing, we refer
to our decision at pages 6-9 where we did consider the limitation
of “a decreasing level of activity within said CPU" (rehearing
request at page 5), and where we also gave our rationale for
holding that the Examiner had a justifiable reason to combine the
references and that the Examiner had indeed presented a prima facie
case. Appellant argues (rehearing request at page 7) that “the
Smith et al. reference teaches a device in which the clock signal

to the CPU is modified only after NO ACTIVITY has been detected for

a PREDETERMINED amount of time ...." In response, we first note




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

that claim 1 requires only that the CPU clock pulse is controlled
in response to Qgg of a decreasing level of activity within said
CPU and said temperature rising to a level above a selected
reference temperature level. That is, it requires only one of the
two criteria, namely, either in response to the decreasing level of
CPU activity or the temperature level rising in the CPU. In any
event, we discussed the limitation of the decreasing level of
activity within said CPU in our decision at the pages noted

above. We reiterate that the claim language does not preclude

the condition of no activity for a predetermined amount of time as
disclosed by Smith et al. The recited decreasing level of activity
in claim 1 is a continuing process of decreasing of the level of
activity and it does include a state where the level of activity
has decreased to a zero level. Appellant also argues that there is
a distinction between “dynamic activity” and “static activity"
(rehearing request at page 13). However, we do not find such a
recitation in claim 1 which only speaks in terms of an activity
level and thereby includes any type of activity, be it static or
dynamic.

Regarding item number 5 (claims 55, 58, 59, 60 and 62,

rehearing request at page 16), we still are of the view that




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

Appellant has merely made conclusory statements regarding the
absence of teaching of the limitations of claim 55, see brief at
page 34, where Appellant merely states, “as far as Appellant can
determine, there is no actual temperature measurement or sensing at
all in Kenny. Accordingly, a combination of the Smith, Kikinis
and Kenny references fail (sic) to teach or suggest this further
limitation ‘wherein said temperature is sensed on a periodic basis’
in combination with the requirements of claim 1." However, we
point out that Kenny does teach at column 1, lines 51-55 that the
temperature is indeed measured by a conventional temperature
monitor such as a thermostat or a diode, and further Kenny at
column 1 lines 65 — column 2 line 2, states that the temperature is
measured as a function of time which would imply to an artisan that
the temperature is measured on a periodic basis.

With respect to item 6 (claims 63, 64 and 66, rehearing
request at page 17), we are persuaded by the Appellant's arguments
that the temperature sensing being user modifiable as recited in
each claims 63, 64 and 66 is not taught by the combination of Smith
and Kikinis. Therefore, we modify our decision in that rejection

of claims 63, 64 and 66 over Smith and Kikinis is now reversed.




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. l999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

Regarding item 7 (claim 21, rehearing request at page l8),
we still are of the view that Appellant at page 27 of the brief
makes a mere conclusory statement regarding claim 2l, which is
not in accordance with 37 CFR § l.l92 (c)(8)(iv)(l998). However,
for the rationale we gave regarding the combination of Smith and
Kikinis with respect to claim l, and further considering the
teaching of Kenny the concept of having power on and off depending
upon the temperature condition of the integrated chip (for example,
column l lines 50-64), we hold the recited limitations to be taught
by their combination. Therefore, claim 2l is obvious in view of
Smith, Kikinis and Kenny.

Regarding item 8 (claims 2l, 70-72, and through claim
dependency, claims 22-27, 55, 56, 58-60, 62, 67, 73 and 74,
rehearing request at page l9), Appellant raises the issue of
failure of a prima facie case of obviousness. In this regard, we
direct Appellant's attention to our decision at pages l3-l6. We
explained our position in holding that the combination of Smith,
Kikinis and Kenny did present a prima facie case of obviousness
with a justifiable reason for the combination. We reemphasize our
position that Kenny does teach the prediction of the temperature at

column 2, lines 37-47 where Kenny teaches that the temperature is




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

increasing or decreasing resulting in heating or cooling. The
terms heating and cooling imply that a prediction of the future
temperature conditions is being contemplated.

With respect to item 9 (claim 22, (rehearing request at page
23), Appellant objects to our statement in the decision at page l5,
namely, “the clock rate ‘HAS TO BE’ regulated in such a way that
the temperature does not exceed the selected reference level and in
doing so they would have to control the length of the OFF state for
the power to the CPU". For clarification, we add here that Kenny
as pointed out, supra, teaches the concept of having the power off
in case of a heat build up in an integrated circuit (column 1,
lines 51-64). Therefore, an artisan would have found it obvious to
control the off state condition of the clock pulses going to the
CPU in order to avoid the build up of heat in the chip (CPU), and
hence prevent the rising of the temperature of CPU beyond a
selected reference temperature level.

Concerning item 10 (claim 23, rehearing request at page 24),
we find that Appellant has recited no particular structure or
specific method for the accomplishment of the recited optimized
efficiency level of the CPU in claim 23. We are of the view that

an artisan, knowing from the teachings of the combination of Smith,




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

Kikinis and Kenny that the heat build up affects the operation of a
CPU, would have found an obvious matter to operate the CPU at its
optimum condition by controlling the result effective variables
including the activity level and the temperature build up in the
CPU. This accords with the rule that discovery of an optimum value
of a result effective variable in a known process is ordinarily
within the skill of the art. In re Antonie, 559 F.2d 618, 195 USPQ
6 (CCPA 1977); In re Aller, 42 CCPA 824, 220 F.2d 454, 105 USPQ 233
(CCPA 1955).

Regarding item 11 (claims 24, 25, 26 and 27, rehearing request
at page 25), we give Appellant the benefit of the conclusory
statements as being the substantive arguments. We find that
because the combination of Smith, Kikinas and Kenny teaches the
build up of heat and hence the rising of the temperature as the
clock pulse or the power is modulated in a integrated circuit
(CPU), it would have been obvious to an artisan that when the off
state (absence of power or clock pulses to the CPU) is at zero, the
power build up or the heat build up in the CPU would be maximum
(claim 24), and that power consumption in the CPU would decrease as
the duration of the off state increases (claim 25). Regarding

claim 26, Smith teaches or discloses the concept of minimum clock




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. l999—2052
Application No. 08/572,202

rate at which the CPU can operate, as in the sleep mode. Regarding
claim 27, an artisan would have obviously recognized that if the
clocks for the CPUs are completely stopped, the clock rate would be
at zero.

With respect to items l2, l3 and l4 (claims 55, 56 and 58
respectively, rehearing request at pages 27-32), we again give
Appellant the benefit of the conclusory statements as a substitute
for substantive arguments. We find, in addition to our prior
pointing out that Kenny does measure the temperature by
a thermostat or a diode, that Kenny also teaches the periodic
measurement of the temperature in the integrated circuit, (see
column l, line 65 — column 2 line 2, where the temperature
measurement is disclosed to be made as a function of time, clearly
implying that the temperature measurement is done on a periodic
basis).

Regarding items l5, l6 and l7 (claims 59, 60 and 62, request
rehearing request at pages 32-38), each claim has the limitation,
“the frequency of said temperatures sensing changes as said

temperature reaches pre selected threshold values”. We agree with

Appellant's argument (id.) that the combination of Smith, Kikinis

and Kenny does not teach this limitation. Therefore, we modify our




*** PAGE 9 ***


Appeal No. l999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

decision in that we reverse the rejection of claims 59, 60 and 62
over Smith, Kikinis and Kenny.

Regarding item l8 (claim 67, rehearing request at page 38-40),
we clarify the paragraph from page l6 of our decision which
Appellant has quoted at page 39 of the request for rehearing,
in that the quoted disclosure of Kenny at column 2 lines 37-47
states that the sampling indicates that the integrated circuits
temperature is either cool or cooling, such that temperature count
is thereby decreased, or the sampling indicates the integrated
circuit is generating too much heat and its temperature is
increasing. This process of cooling and heating (temperature
increasing) indicates that the temperature measurement is of
predictive type, which is not static but dynamic and contemplates
the future happenings to the heating and cooling state of the
circuit. Therefore, we find that Kenny discloses the teaching of
predicting future temperature levels as recited in these claims.

Regarding item l9 (claims 28 and 29, rehearing request at
pages 40-43), we have already discussed the propriety of the
combination of Smith, Kikinis and Gephardt at pages l6 and l7 of
our decision. The arguments regarding the lack of a prima facie

case in this combination and that Smith only shows that the




*** PAGE 10 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2052
Application No. 08/572,202

CPU is modified only after no activity has been deducted for a
predetermined amount of time have been already addressed above.

In conclusion, we have carefully considered the arguments
raised by Appellant in his request for reconsideration.
Consequently, we have modified our decision in that we reverse the
rejection of claims 59, 60 and 62 over Smith, Kikinis and Kenny,
and the rejection of claims 63, 64 and 66 over Smith and Kikinis.

In all other respects, the prior decision is not changed.

10




*** PAGE 11 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2052

We have granted Appellant's request to the extent that we have
modified our decision of May 6, 2002, regarding claims of 59, 60,
62, 63, 64 and 66, however, in all other respects the decision
remains unchanged.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection
with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § l.l36(a).

ABRAMS, A 'n' r "v a nt u

ON REQUEST FOR REHARING
This case comes before us again on request by the

appellant for rehearing of our decision of August 31, 1999,

 

1 Application for patent filed May 24, 1995.

2Judge Frankfort was designated to this panel for the

*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2335
Application No. 08/449,809

wherein we sustained the rejection of claims 1-7, 10-12 and
14-22 under

35 U.S.C. § 103.3 It is the appellant's position that the
panel erred in agreeing with the examiner that it would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the
Turner system by replacing the shelves upon which the
substrates are supported during heating with the open trays of
Yamabe. Upon reconsideration of this decision in the light of
the presentation made by the appellant in the Request for
Rehearing, we have come to the conclusion that our original
decision on this matter should be modified in conformance with
the following comments.

Independent claim 1 is exemplary of the appellant's
invention, in that it requires that there be a substrate
holding stack adapted to hold the substrates in a spaced
generally “open stacked configuration" such that the sides of
the substrates directly opposite one another are able to

directly transfer heat between adjacent substrates. All of

3Not sustained were rejections of claims 1-7 and 9-22
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first and second paragraphs, and a
rejection of claims 9 and 13 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2335
Application No. 08/449,809

the other independent claims also contain a limitation which
focuses on adjacent substrates being so positioned and
oriented as to allow heat to be radiated between their facing
surfaces. The claims stand rejected by the examiner as being
unpatentable over Turner in View of Yamabe.

Turner discloses a substrate processing system that
includes a plurality of heating chambers which are maintained
at a desired temperature by heaters located in the chamber
walls. Within each chamber are a plurality of vertically
spaced substrate support shelves, each having a pair of
dielectric mounts upon which the substrates to be treated are
placed in spaced relationship from the shelves. In a
continuous process, a loading system successively places
unheated individual substrates onto the shelves and then
removes them when they have been heated to the desired
temperature. The shelves are made of heat conductive material
and are of solid construction, therefore blocking direct
radiation of heat between the faces of adjacent substrates.
Once heated to operating temperature by the heaters in the
walls of the chamber, the shelves continuously radiate heat to

the faces of adjacent substrates so that the substrates are

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. l999—2335
Application No. 08/449,809

“radiantly heated . . . uniformly from both sides, which
provides for rapid and uniform heating” (column 5, lines 49-
51).

Yamabe discloses a system in which a plurality of
substrates are positioned on support shelves and then are
loaded into a heating chamber in a batch, at which point the
chamber is heated until the substrates reach the proper
processing temperature. The Yamabe shelves have open centers
and support the substrates only at their outer peripheries,
which allows the faces of the substrates directly opposite one
another to be in open relationship. A relatively large heat-
absorbing mass is configured into the peripheral portion of
each shelf. In operation, as the chamber is brought up to the
desired temperature by the heaters in the chamber walls, heat
is radiated inwardly toward the surfaces of the substrates.

If left unchecked, the tendency would be for the peripheral
portion of each substrate to absorb more heat than the central
portion, as is illustrated in Figure 5, resulting in uneven
heating of the substrate. The mass of material on the
peripheries of the shelves counteracts this tendency by

absorbing some of that heat. See column 3, line 67 et seq.;




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2335
Application No. 08/449,809

column 5, lines 1-9; column 6, lines 44-46; column 7, line 29
et seq.

The dispositive issue in this case is whether it would
have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to
modify the Turner system by replacing the solid shelves with
the open shelves disclosed in the Yamabe system. We now are
persuaded to answer this in the negative, on the basis of the
following reasoning. Both systems utilize heaters located
outwardly of the peripheries of the substrates and seek to
provide even heat distribution across the exposed faces of the
substrates, but they accomplish this in different ways because
of the difference between continuous and batch processing. It
is axiomatic that the mere fact that the prior art structure
gguld be modified does not make such a modification obvious
unless the prior art suggests the desirability of doing so.
See, for example,

In re Gordon, 733 F.2d 900, 902, 221 USPQ 1125, 1127 (Fed.
Cir. 1984). In the present case, we fail to perceive any
teaching, suggestion or incentive in either reference which

would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. l999—2335
Application No. 08/449,809

Turner system by replacing the solid heat radiating shelves
with the open heat absorbing shelves of Yamabe. First, there
is no explicit teaching or indication that it would be
advantageous to utilize open shelves in the Turner system.
Second, replacing Turner's solid heat—radiating shelves with
Yamabe’s open shelves would result in uneven heating of the
substrates in the Turner continuous process system because the
masses on peripheries of the open shelves would unnecessarily
absorb heat. Thus, the even heating provided by the solid
shelves in the Turner system would be compromised, which would
have been a disincentive to one of ordinary skill in the art
to make the proposed substitution.

We therefore conclude that the combined teachings of
Turner and Yamabe fail to establish a prima facie of
obviousness with regard to the subject matter of independent
claims l, l0, l4, l8 and l9, and we will not sustain the
rejection of these claims under 35 U.S.C. § lO3 or, it
follows, the claims dependent thereon.

Upon rehearing, our prior decision is modified as
follows:

The examiner's rejection of claims l—7 and 9-22 under 35

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has filed a Request for Rehearing under 37 CFR § 1.197(b) (Paper No.

52), requesting rehearing of our decision entered September 5, 2002, wherein we
sustained the final rejection of claims 88-139 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

In our decision we determined that the metes and bounds of the claim recitation
“electronic mail message" was a material inquiry in proper interpretation of the
representative claims. Appellant submitted that the term was well known in the art, and

that formal definition could be found in technical dictionaries.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2767
Applition No. 08/738,461

After consulting technil dictionaries for the relevant terms, we concluded that
the broadest reasonable interpretation of “electronic mail message” did not preclude
files transferred by electronic communication over the local area network (LAN)
disclosed by one of the two references which the examiner submitted as evidence of
obviousness for the claimed subject matter. As a result, we found that the subject
matter of the representative claims was anticipated by the reference describing the
electronic communication over the LAN. We sustained the examiner's rejection of the
claims under 35 U.S.C. § 103 because anticipation has been held to be the “epitome"
of obviousness.

Appellant submits that we erred in failing to denominate the afﬁrmance as a new
ground of rejection, as provided for by 37 CFR § 1.196(b), and request that we do so.
Appellant cites In re Kronig, 539 F.2d 1300, 1302, 190 USPQ 425, 426 (CCPA 1976),
for the proposition that a rejection must be considered "new" if the appellant has not
had a fair opportunity to react to the thrust of the rejection.

Because our interpretation of “electronic mail message” as used in the instant
claims was apparently different (i.e., broader) than the examiner’s interpretation of the
term, we grant the relief requested by appellant. We characterize our afﬁrmance of the
rejection as a new ground of rejection under 37 CFR § 1.196(b).

Appellant points to nothing in our opinion that we consider as corresponding to
any allegation of error with respect to the merits of the decision. To the extent

appellant's request may be construed in any fashion as challenging the merits of the

-2-

the requested relief with respect to the procedural matter, by agreeing that our
affirmance is to be considered a new ground of rejection under 37 CFR § 1.196(b).

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal

may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

*** PAGE 2 ***


I. Introduction

This interference is before a merits panel for a decision on priority
motions regarding Count 2, the sole count in interference. Generally, Count
2 is directed to a detergent tablet that, among other things, has a compressed
region that has a recess containing a solidified solution or melt region. The
Count requires that the compressed portion of the tablet dissolve at a faster
rate than the solidified melt or solution region of the tablet.

Previously, the Board denied junior party Henkel Substantive Motion
4 for priority of invention and dismissed as moot senior party Procter &
Gamble Company “P&G” Substantive Motion 5 (priority of invention) and
Motion 7 (correction of inventorship). (Decision, Paper 115). Henkel
timely sought judicial review by appeal to the Federal Circuit. On appeal,
the Federal Circuit vacated the Board’s denial of Henkel’s motion and
dismissal of P&G’s motions and remanded the case to the Board for further
proceedings consistent with its opinion. Henkel Corp. v. Procter & Gamble
Co., 485 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

There are two motions awaiting decision: P&G Motion 7 to correct
inventorship and P&G Motion 5 for judgment on priority.1 Henkel opposes
both motions.

P&G has proven by clear and convincing evidence that an Alasdair

McGregor was a joint inventor as he contributed to the conception of the

1 During the preliminary motions phase, P&G filed a P&G Motion 5 to
correct inventorship (Paper 57), and Henkel opposed (Paper 60). The Board
dismissed the motion and opposition without prejudice to renew during the
priority phase of the interference. (Paper 65). Apparently, P&G
rnisnumbered its priority motion as “P&G Motion 5.” For purposes of this
opinion, unless otherwise stated, any reference to P&G Motion 5 is intended
to reference P&G’s priority motion.




*** PAGE 3 ***


invention in a manner that was not insignificant in quality. Further, P&G
tells a straightforward and simple story regarding reduction to practice.
Specifically, a McGregor Record of Invention (ROI) describes a procedure
for making tablets having certain physical properties including a concavity
into which is dropped a polyethylene glycol melt. The ROI teaches that the
polyethylene glycol is selected to control the temperature at which it starts to
melt/dissolve in the wash cycle. A laboratory technician working for a
named inventor, Metzger-Groom, tested tablets made according to the
procedure described in McGregor’s ROI. The tablets worked for their
intended purpose. This result was then shared with the named inventor as
well as McGregor prior to Henkel’s earliest actual reduction to practice.
Based on the evidence, we hold that P&G has proved by at least a
preponderance of the evidence that it made, and at least one inventor
appreciated, an embodiment within the scope of Count 2, the sole count in
the interference, prior to Henkel’s earliest actual reduction to practice.

Judgment on priority of invention is awarded against Henkel.

H. Procedural History

The Board declared this interference and designated Henkel as the
junior party based on an accorded priority date of December 30, 1997 and
designated P&G senior party based on its accorded priority date of
November 19, 1997.

The parties disputed the scope of the count, and in particular, the
manner in which a difference in dissolution rates was determined. Based on
the parties’ arguments, the Board construed the count as requiring that a
difference in dissolution rates is determined by measuring and calculating

the dissolution rates. Having construed the count, the Board then analyzed




*** PAGE 4 ***


Henkel’s alleged conception and actual reduction to practice.

Based upon its ﬁndings, the Board held that Henkel had failed to
corroborate by a preponderance of the evidence that its named inventors
conceived of an embodiment within the scope of the count prior to P&G’s
accorded beneﬁt date. In particular, the Board found that Henkel failed to
demonstrate that the inventor’s conceived of the dissolution rate difference
embodied in the Count. The Board held that an actual reduction to practice
requires a contemporaneous appreciation of an embodiment within the scope
of the count. The Board concluded that, as Henkel’s inventors had not been
shown to have conceived of the invention, the inventors could not have
contemporaneously appreciated the invention.

On appeal Henkel challenged the Board’s construction of the count
and the Board’s ﬁndings as to actual reduction to practice. Henkel Corp. at
1374. As to the count, the Federal Circuit agreed that Henkel’s priority
motion provided calculations of dissolution rates, but held that Henkel did
not concede that a calculation was required. The Federal Circuit determined
that for purposes of the count “an explicit calculation or measurement of
quantitative dissolution rates is unnecessary.” Id. As to Henkel’s actual
reduction to practice, the Federal Circuit stated that the inventor’s
appreciation of the dissolution rates was demonstrated by a laboratory
technicians observations coupled with evidence that he worked under the
close supervision of the inventor. Id. at 1375. Specifically, the Federal
Circuit found that:

Moreover, SchliWka's observations, coupled with the
record evidence of his interactions with Holderbaum, sufﬁce to
demonstrate appreciation of the different dissolution rates. As a
matter of law, we do not require that a junior party in an
interference demonstrate that it recognized the exact language




*** PAGE 5 ***


of the ultimate count— only the subject matter of the invention.
See Mycogen Plant Sci., Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 243 F.3d 1316,
1336 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that there was sufficient
appreciation when an inventor recognized a process in terms of
codons—groups of three nucleotides—instead of the ultimately
claimed nucleotides). This is not a case in which there is a
signiﬁcant danger that the inventors unwittingly and
accidentally created something new; rather, they set out to
design detergent tablets with a particular structure and did so,
and the only question is whether they appreciated that the
tablets met one limitation of the interference count. Schliwka's
direct visual observation is enough to demonstrate that the
tablet met the “faster rate” limitation.

Schliwka, of course, is not an inventor. However,
Holderbaurn's statements demonstrate that he was aware of
Schliwka's results. In his own Words, he “supervised  Mr.
Schliwka and conferred with [hi]m on virtually a daily basis
and was well aware of [his] activities and results.” Interference
Opinion, slip op. at 11, ‘j[ 29 (emphasis added). Holderbaum
made this statement in the specific context of Schliwka's
recognition of the dissolution rates: “[Sch]iwka] tested the Ring
tabs  and found that the Ring tab partially dissolved, but that
the solidified melt filling did not dissolve.” Id. It is true that the
declarations submitted to the Board do not detail a speciﬁc
conversation or explicitly aver that the inventors appreciated the
specific limitation at the time of Schliwka's experiments, but
such a formulaic affirmation is unnecessary under the facts of
this case. The limitation in question is a discemible property of
the invention that was directly observed by a technician
working under the close supervision of one of the inventors. To
require a more speciﬁc declaration than Henkel has proferred
would be to undermine our holding in Mycogen that an inventor
can demonstrate appreciation without enunciating the precise
language of the interference count.

'. at 1375-76). The Federal Circuit detennined that the appreciation was
roborated based upon Mrs. Nejtek’s test results being provided to an
'entor. While Nejte ’s “results” were directed to cleaning capacity, the




*** PAGE 6 ***


Federal Circuit found this to be sufficient corroboration stating that:

Moreover, the evidence shows that Schliwka communicated his
understanding to Holderbaum. Both Schliwka and Holderbaum
testified that they worked closely together and that Holderbaum
was aware of Schliwka's results. In addition, Nejtek's testing
confirms the existence of the invention, and Dr. Jeschke
testified that he reported her results to a group of inventors,
including Holderbaum, no later than May 1997.
(Id.). The Federal Circuit concluded that the Board erred in denying
Henkel’s priority motion. The Federal Circuit vacated the denial of the

Henkel’s motion and the dismissal of P&G’s motions as moot and remanded

the case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.

12) The Federal Circuit held that non-inventor testimony corroborated

Dr. Holderbaum’s, a Henkel inventor’s, appreciation of the invention by no

later than May 1997. Id.

13) The Federal Circuit did not identify a specific date in May 1997 for
the corroboration of Dr. Holberbaum’s appreciation of the invention
however, on the facts of this case the specific date is moot as P&G has

demonstrated an actual reduction to practice in February 1997.

16) That he was on the same project team, automatic dishWashing,2 as
Lynda Speed, Jeff Painter and Sabine Metzger-Groom at the P&G
Newcastle Technical Center between at least about November 1996 and

May 1, 1997. (PX 1028, ‘H 11).

2 While McGregor’s declaration does not identify what project the team was
working on, Painter’s testimony identifies the team project as relating to
automatic dishwashing. (PX 1036, ‘j[ 4).

11




*** PAGE 12 ***


17) He was in regular communication with the project members, and in
particular, with Lynda Speed who he generally communicated on a weekly
basis and Metzger-Groom whom he frequently had conversations with

regarding the project. (Id. at ‘H 11, 14).

18) As required by management, his standard practice was to publish
monthly reports within one week after the end of the month. (Id. at ‘H 5).

19) He published his April 1996 monthly report (PX 1023), which
describes his work in increasing the dissolution rate of the compressed
tablets by reducing the tabletting pressure, increasing the hydration of the

phosphate in the tablet and by increasing the surface area of the tablet by
dimpling the surface of the tablet. (Id. at ‘H 6).

20) He published his May 1996 monthly report (PX 1024), which
describes his work in increasing the dissolution rate of the tablet by
increasing the level of phosphate hydration and his intent to prepare a

Record of Invention documenting the dissolution benefits from using the

higher hydration levels. (Id. at ‘H 7).

21) He published his November 1996 monthly report (PX 1025), which
describes his successes in demonstrating that the European Tablets (ET)
dissolved at a sufficient rate to meet project performance criteria due to

increase hexahydrate conversion and reduced hardness of the tablet. (Id. at

‘J1 8)-

22) He prepared an ROI (PX 1009) and sent the R01 to his senior

12




*** PAGE 13 ***


manager, Michael Addison on or about November 22, 1996. (Id. at SI 12).

23) He communicated with Lynda Speed and Jeff Painter, a named
inventor on the involved ‘564 patent, on at least one occasion before
November 22, 1996 with respect to the development described in the ROI.
(Id. at ‘][ 1 1).

24) Prior to November 22, 1996 Lynda Speed shared her perspective
regarding the release of actives from a detergent tablet. (Id.).

25) Prior to November 22, 1996, McGregor asked Jeff Painter about
materials, such as waxes, that would start to melt/dissolve at various

temperatures. (Id.).

26) Jeff Painter shared his perspective on the use of PEG and NB-base in
a detergent tablet with McGregor prior to November 22, 1996 and this
communication is evidenced by McGregor’s ROI. (Id.).

27) He authored the ROI, which describes compressed tablets having a
cavity and a solidiﬁed melt in the cavity “dimpled tablets,” and sent the R01
to his manager Michael Addison on or about November 22, 1996. (Id. at

‘J[12).

28) He made the tablets described in Examples 1-3 of the ROI no later
than November 22, 1996. (Id. at‘][ 13).

29) In early January 1997 he read Sabine Metzger-Groom’s January 1,

13




*** PAGE 14 ***


1997 monthly report (PX 1033), which reported that dimpled tablets, made
according the procedure set forth in his ROI where the dimple contains NB-

base and PEG 3000, worked for its intended purpose of carotenoid stain
removal. (Id. at‘][ 14 and PX 1033).

30) Based on his membership on the same project as Sabine Metzger-
Groom and his frequent conversations regarding the project with her,
McGregor would have discussed the data with her shortly after the
generation of the data was reported in Metzger-Groom’s January report.

(PX 1028 at g1 14).

31) He published his Januaiy 1997 monthly report (PX 1026), which
describes his work on tablets having prehydrated phosphate with 12%
moisture. (Id. at ‘H 9).

32) He published his February 1997 monthly report (PX 1026), which
describes his dimpled tablets as providing ﬂexibility to control the

dissolution rate of the actives suspended in the tablet and the filing of the
ROI. (Id. at ‘J[ 10).

33) He worked with patent practitioner Claire Goodier in her drafting of
the February 14, 1997 and June 2, 1997 patentability opinions relating to the
subject matter of his ROI. (Id. at ‘H 15).

34) That he knew, on or before February 14, 1997, that the compressed
region of his detergent tablet dissolved at a greater rate than the non-

compressed region. (PX 1042, ‘j[ 4).

14




*** PAGE 15 ***


35) His work through 1996 was directed to finding ways of increasing the
dissolution rate of the compressed region, as evidenced by his monthly

reports. (Id. at ‘]I 5).

36) His work described in the ROI demonstrates his interest in slowing

the dissolution of the non-compressed region of the tablet, i.e., the solidified
melt dimple. (Id. at ‘H 6-7).

37) That the use of a PEG 3,000 dimple was to delay the delivery of the
actives to a point where they were most effective in the wash cycle and he
and his project team appreciated this fact at the time of the ROI, and
certainly by the date of the first patentability opinion, February 14, 1997.
(Id. at ‘][‘J[ 8- 10).

38) That, while his laboratory notebooks he kept during 1996 and 1997
were lost, the ROI, patentability opinions, and his monthly reports accurately
demonstrate that, by at least February 14, 1997, he appreciated that the
solidiﬁed melt portion of his dimpled tablets dissolved at a slower rate than
the compressed region of the tablet. (Id. at ‘J[ 11).

39) Regarding the loss of McGregor’s notebooks, David Smith testifies
that he was McGregor’s immediate supervisor at the time of the ROI. (PX

1029, ‘ll 6).

40) Smith testiﬁes that he and McGregor discussed the loss of the
notebooks in June 2004 and that apparently McGregor’s notebooks were left

15




*** PAGE 16 ***


on his desk upon transferring out from P&G’s technical center at Newcastle,
England. (Id.).

41) Smith testifies as to his efforts to locate McGregor’s notebooks
surrounding the developments in the ROI but states that the notebooks have
not been located and are likely lost. (Id. at ‘M 6-8).

42) Smith’s testimony is credible on its face and the loss of the notebooks
does not appear to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny of the underlying records

surrounding the ROI.

2. Addison’s Declaration Testimony (PX 1041)
43) M.C. Addison testiﬁes that he was an Associate Director at P&G
between Nov. 1, 1996 and July 1, 1997. (PX 1041, ‘j[ 4).

request to prepare a patent application based on the ROI (PX 1040). (Id. at

‘l 5)-

45) Addison witnessed the ROI and understood its meaning and
significance as he was McGregor’s manager and “was well aware of the

work he was performing.” (Id. at ‘J[ 6).

46) Addison was responsible for reading documents, like the ROI, to

determine if they merited the resources to file a patent application. (Id.).

47) Addison provided authorization (PX 1040) for a patentability opinion

16




*** PAGE 17 ***


from a patent attorney and although he didn’t date the correspondence
authorizing the patentability opinion, the date stamp demonstrates it was

signed on or before February 26, 1997. (Id.).

50) Goodier communicated with McGregor, Speed and Metzger-Groom

before authoring and issuing her patentability opinions. (Id.).

51) Goodier was in regular communication with McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom and attended the majority of project meetings at Newcastle
Technical Center that would include the attendance of McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom. (Id.).

8. Alasdair Duncan McGregor Pre-ROI Monthly Reports
88) McGregor’s April 1996 report provides the following summary:

This monthly report summarizes the current status of ideas to
increase the dissolution rate of phosphate tablets:
Increasing the hydration state of the phosphate.
Incorporating a tablet disintegrant into the phosphate
matrix.
Contouring of the tablet surface.

(PX 1023).
89) The April 1996 report states that a 100% increase in surface area can
be achieved by contouring the surface of the tablets, like a golf ball, and

states that the contouring can be accomplished with tablet punch heads.

23




*** PAGE 24 ***


(Id.).

90) The April 1996 report also states that increasing the hydration of the
phosphate allows for a 3 minute increase in dissolution time for the tablet.

(Id.).

91) McGregor’s May 1996 provides data from experiments on increasing
the level of phosphate hydration with the fastest dissolution times achieved
using higher phosphate hydration levels. (PX 1024).

92) The May 1996 report states that increasing the phosphate hydration
level will increase the dissolution rate for tablets of equal hardness. (Id.).

93) The May 1996 report also states that an ROI will be prepared to
document the dissolution benefits of phosphate with higher hydration levels.
(Id.).

94) McGregor’s November 1996 report states:

The European Tablet (ET) now dissolves at a sufficient rate into
the wash so as to meet the project performance criteria.
Increased phosphate hexa-hydrate conversion and reduced
hardness have achieved this increase in dissolution rate.

(PX 1025).

9. McGregor Record of Invention (“ROI”) dated November
22, 1996 (PX 1009)

95) P&G has submitted an exhibit entitled “RECORD OF INVENTION”




*** PAGE 25 ***


(“ROI”). (PX 1009, p. 1).

96) The ROI identiﬁes Alasdair McGregor of the “Dish Process Dev.” as
the compiler of the ROI and a compilation date of November 22, 1996.

97) P&G’s ROI is entitled “Dimpled Tablets: Reactive raw materials

delivered via an inert carrier to maintain raw material activity.” (Id.).

98) The ROI contains two signature blocks, one for the signature of
“Director, Associated Director or Department Head” and one for “Patent

Counsel.” (Id.).

99) A “T.N. Gibson” signature is adjacent to the Patent Counsel signature

block and, while not entirely legible, what appears to be a signature of a “M.

C. Addison” is adjacent to the Director signature block. (Id.).

100) The ROI states that a legal opinion on the development described

therein is believed to involve worthwhile novel subject matter. (ROI, PX

1009, p. 1).

101) The ROI identifies the following problem in the art:

In general raw materials which have been tabletted are
inherently less stable than in granular form. Therefore some
raw materials which can be delivered in a granular product form
are unstable in a tablet form and lose their activity. This
reduces performance of the product.

i.e. Tergitol — grease cleaning surfactant is unstable in a

tablet
NB Base — cartenoid stain remover is unstable in a tablet

25




*** PAGE 26 ***


(Id.).

102)

The ROI further states that:

Via this development, highly active ingredients that would
normally be untablettable can be included in tablet form, by
adding a highly active ingredient via an unreactive rr1ix onto the
surface of a tablet as a) a coating, b) as a filling for an
indentation on the surface of a tablet.

au.at2)

103)

The ROI states that highly active ingredients can be incorporated into

a tablet form without losing activity by using a “dimple approach.” (Id.).

104)

(Id.).

105)

The ROI describes its dimple approach as follows:

i) A solid or liquid reactive raw material is
suspended in a molten mix of an unreactive (inert) material
which will remain at reasonable temperatures above ambient.

ii) A tablet is tabletted with a concave face (dimple)
or multiple dimples (the indentation can be of any shape or
form), i.e.

iii) The molten mix of reactive raw material and inert

carrier, is dropped onto the surface of the tablet and allowed to
cool or a solid mix is pressed onto the surface of the tablet.

 

The ROI describes controlling the delivery of raw materials into the

wash as follows:

26




*** PAGE 27 ***


Particular raw materials can be delivered into the wash at a
specific time/temperature in the wash cycle so as to maximize
performance potential by:

i) Tablets are prepared as described above.

ii) The inert carrier is chosen carefully so that it only
starts to melt/dissolve at a certain temperature in the wash
cycle. This temperature should coincide with the optimum
release time/temperature for the raw material suspended in the
PEG.

(Melting Point)

i.e.. PEG 900 36 °C

PEG 1000 39 °C
PEG 1500 45 °C
PEG 8000 62 °C

(Id. at 3).

106) The ROI provides three examples of dimpled detergent tablets and a

schematic blockﬂow diagram of the tabletting process.

107) The three examples contain generally the same compressed tablet

portions. Examples 1 and 2 describe the compressed granule portion of the

tablet as having:

53.82% phosphate (12% moisture),
15% 2 R sodium silicate,

14% sodium carbonate

108) Example 3 contains the same ingredients and proportions as Examples
1 and 2 except that Example 3 contained 55.32% of the phosphate and 0%
Green Amylase. (Id. at 7).

109) The granules of Example 1 were tabletted with a dimple as follows:

These granules were tabletted @ 7tonf to a hardness of 21kg
and a weight of 20g with convex top punch. Dies + lower
punches diameter (mm): 34.0 Upper punches, hemispherical
dimple diameter (mm): 20mm

(Id. at 5).

110) The granules of Examples 2 and 3 were tabletted the same way as
Example 1 except that the diameter of the dimple was 10 mm. (Id. at 6-7).

11 1) Example 1 describes its dimpled tablet as a Tergitol (grease cleaner)
stability ﬁx where the dimple was formed by dropping a liquid mixture of
Tergitol and PEG 10,000 into the dimple on the compressed tablet. (Id. at
5).

112) Example 2 describes its dimpled tablet as a NB Base (cartenoid stain
remover) stability ﬁx where the dimple was formed by dropping a mixture
of NB Base and PEG 4,000 into the dimple on the compressed tablet. (Id. at
6).

113) Example 3 describes its dimpled tablet as an optimum performance
PCA Base (bleach catalyst) tablet where the dimple was formed by dropping

28

a mixture of Amalyse l20CT/PCA and PEG 3,000 into the dimple on the
compressed tablet. (Id. at 7).

114) The ROI contains a schematic blockﬂow diagram of the tabletting
process for “Dimpled ET.” (Id. at 8).

The above schematic depicts what is said to be a blockﬂow diagram of an
ET (European Tablet) automatic dishwashing tabletting process.

116) The lower right hand corner of the schematic has a date of “28/10/96.”

117) The schematic depicts a resulting tablet having the same ingredients

as Example 1 as follows:

ELDIQQJIMH

11  bani
30 min: dissolution

 

(Id. at 8). The above tablet has a dimple that covers less than 40% of the
total surface area of the tablet (top, bottom and sides).

118) The ROI identiﬁes the chronology of events in the development of the

tablet as including:

September ’96 In work to identify a ﬁx for delivering
Tergitol in tablets the idea to separate tergitol from the main
body of the tablet and apply it via an inert carrier was
identified.

November ’96 Initial laboratory scale work was carried out

31




*** PAGE 32 ***


to identify a suitable inert carrier (i.e. PEG 10 000) and identify
the performance benefits.

(Id. at 9).

119) Mr. McGregor signed the ROI but did not identify anyone else as
contributing to the “initial idea.” (Id. at 9).

9. Sabine Metzger-Groom January 1997 Monthly Report
120) P&G submitted an exhibit PX 1033, which is a single page “Cleaning
Monthly Report” of Sabine U. Metzger-Groom.

121) The monthly report has a “period ending” date of 1/1/97 on the upper

left corner of the report.

122) The report has a title “DIMPLE TABLET PROMISING CONCEPT
FOR SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF NB-BASE.”

123) The top of the report states that:

A new idea in ADW is the “dimple tablet.” We are currently
looking into Ways to use this concept to overcome the storage
stability problems seen with NB-base in regular tablets, and to
deliver the carotenoid stain removal beneﬁt.

124) The report states that the dimple tablet concept enables “physically
separate currently incompatible active ingredients in tablet formation and

appropriate rate of delivery of new technologies.”

125) Under the heading of “Current Status,” the report describes a dimple

32




*** PAGE 33 ***


tablet developed with A.D. McGregor having a dimple containing “PEG
3000 (low melting point ~45°C) and NB-base particles.”

126) The report states that dimple tablets had been placed in storage “with

and w/o NB-base” for two and four weeks at ambient and 40 °C.

127) The report states that the dimple tablet was stable up to at least 40 °C.

128) The report states that dimple tablets were tested for carotenoid stain
removal and were slightly worse than that of regular tablets, the difference
being 61% stain removal with ET tablet with dimple versus 65-68% stain

removal for regular ET tablets.

129) The report identifies two potential reasons for the slight loss in
performance including the “slower release of the NB-base from the dimple

versus the regular tablets.”

130) The report, under the heading “Next steps” states that NB-base
activity prior to and after storage and performance after storage will be

tested early January 1997.

131) Also under the heading, “Next steps” the report states that an
investigation is underway into the hypothesis that early release of NB-base
from the tablet is critical to the performance of the tablet and that using

lower molecular weight PEG and fizzy tablets may facilitate such a release.

132) The report also identiﬁes a future design of the tablet as potentially

33




*** PAGE 34 ***


including a NB-base in a low molecular weight PEG/fizzy matrix to ensure
the faster release of the NB-base as compared to the release of an active

(GCS system) in the compressed portion of the tablet.

133) The reported observation of slower release of NB-base from the melt
region as compared to the compressed region is consistent with the future

investigations of using a lower molecular weight PEG to speed the release of

the NB-base.

10. McGregor’s Post-ROI Monthly Reports
134) McGregor’s January 1997 monthly report states that pre-hydrated
phosphate improved the dissolution of the tablet and identifies a 12%

moisture level, which is the same level exemplified in McGregor’s ROI.

(PX 1026).

135) McGregor’s January 1997 monthly report states that 4 week storage
data for tablets at elevated temperature and humidity was being collected

with results due January 2, 1997. (PX 1026).

136) McGregor’s February 1997 monthly report provides the following
summary of his work on dimpled tablets:

The “dimpled” tablet is a new concept in ADW tabletting. It
combines the main detergent ingredients in a traditional tablet
base using a convex upper punch. This leaves a dimple in the
upper surface of the tablet which can then be filled with active
ingredients which would otherwise be untablettable. This
concept introduces 2 potentially revolutionary advantages.

1) The ﬂexibility to independently control the
dissolution rate of actives suspended in the dimple.

34




*** PAGE 35 ***


2) The ﬂexibility to incorporate active ingredients in
a tablet form without exposing these ingredients to the high
forces traditionally associated with detergent tabletting and
hence the potential to lose activity.

An ROI has now been filed which encompasses this
general concept with particular reference to incorporating
Tergitol and/or NB-base in a tablet form.

(PX 1027).

11. Claire Goodier Patentability Opinion - February 14, 1997
137) Claire Goodier prepared a patentability opinion that is said to
correspond to ROI 2028 by Alasdair McGregor. (PX 1030).

138) The number 2028 appears on the bottom of the first page of
McGregor’s November 22, 1996 ROI. (PX 1030, p. 1).

139) The patentability report (PX 1030) has a date of February 14, 1997 in
the upper comer of the first page and is addressed to M.C. Addison, which

was McGregor’s supervisor.
140) The February patentability report identifies the subject of the report
as: “Dimpled Tablets — reactive/unstable raw materials delivered in a tablet

by Way of an inert carrier.” (PX 1030, p. 1).

141) The February report describes a problem in the art with stability of
active materials in a tablet, e.g., they lose their reactivity. (Id.).

142) The February report states that the invention is to include ingredients

35




*** PAGE 36 ***


on a dimple on the surface of a tablet where a tablet press compacts
ingredients to form a tablet body, which is then modiﬁed to have a convex
surface. The cavity is then filled with a mixture of an inert carrier and

ingredients that could not have been tabletted. (Id.).

143) The February report states:

An additional benefit associated with this development is the
ability to accelerate or delay the release time of the ingredient
held in the tablet dimple, since the inert carrier can be selected
for a particular melting temperature achieved during the
machine wash cycle.

(Id. at 2).

12. Request for Patent Application — February 26, 1997
144) A request for a patent application was signed by M.C. Addison and
identifies the recipient as “C-L Goodier.” (PX 1040).

145) The request states that it corresponds to McGregor’s R01 2028 and
the request states that the subject of the request is:

Dimpled Tablets — reactive/unstable raw materials delivered in
a tablet by way of an inert canier.

(Id.).

146) The request states:

I authorize the preparation of a Patent Application based on
ROI 2028 with the Claim scope as outlined in your patentability
opinion.

(Id.).

36




*** PAGE 37 ***


147) The request has a received date of February 26, 1997. (Id.).

13. Claire Goodier Patentability Opinion - June 2, 1997
148) Claire Goodier prepared a patentability opinion that is said to be an
“update” of the patentability opinion on R01 2028. (PX 1031).

149) The patentability report (PX 1031) has a date of June 2, 1997 in the
upper comer of the ﬁrst page and is addressed to M.C. Addison, which was
McGregor’s supervisor. (Id. at 1).

150) The June patentability report refers back to a patentability opinion
written in February 1997. (Id.).

151) The June patentability report describes R01 2028 as relating to dimple
tablets having incompatible ingredients delivered via a solidifying liquid in a
cavity on the surface of a compressed tablet. (Id.).

152) The June patentability report contains five (5) claims directed to
detergent tablets having a compressed portion and a non-compressed

portion. (Id.).
153) Claims 1 and 2 of the June report require the tablet have a dissolution

rate of greater than 20 g/hr as determined using the SOTAX dissolution
method. (Id.).

IV. Opinion

An interference is a procedure to determine who among competing
parties was the first to invent a commonly claimed invention. 35 U.S.C.
§§ 102(g) and 135 (a). To succeed, a party in an interference need only
demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it was the first to invent
where the involved patent and application were co-pending before the
USPTO. See, Eli Lilly & Co. v. Aradigm Corp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1365 (Fed.
Cir. 2004).

P&G Motion 7 contends that Alasdair McGregor was a joint inventor
for the claimed subject matter of P&G’s involved ‘564 patent. P&G’s
Motion 5 for priority contends that McGregor and/or Speed reduced to
practice the invention of Count 2, the sole count in interference, prior to
Henkel’s earliest actual reduction to practice. (P&G Motion 5, Paper 93).

The rules authorize the Board to take up motions for decisions in any
order. 37 C.F.R. § 41.125(a) (2007). We elect to consider P&G’s motion to
add McGregor as an inventor, as a determination of joint inventorship
identifies whether objective evidence is needed to corroborate McGregor’s

subjective testimony regarding his understanding of the invention.
Invitrogen Corp. v. Clontech Labs., Inc., 429 F.3d 1052, 1065 (Fed. Cir.
2005).

A. P&G Motion 7: Motion to Correct Inventorship
P&G’s involved ‘564 patent names on its face Lynda Speed and
Jeffrey Painter as inventors. (‘564 patent, PX 1004). P&G Motion 7

requests that Alasdair Duncan McGregor be added as an inventor on the

‘564 patent. (Paper 94). Henkel opposes. (Paper 100).

1. Statute and Case Law on Joint Inventorship

35 U.S.C. § 256 provides that the Director may, with proof of the
facts and such other requirements, issue a certificate correcting an error in
inventorship of an issued patent where such error arose without any
deceptive intention.

Inventorship is a mixed question of law and fact where the overall
inventorship determination is a question of law, but is premised on
underlying questions of fact. Univ. of Colo. Found., Inc. v. Am. Cyanamid
Co., 342 F.3d 1298, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The issue of joint inventorship is
governed by 35 U.S.C. §l16, which provides that:

When an invention is made by two or more persons jointly,
they shall apply for patent jointly and each make the required
oath, except as otherwise provided in this title. Inventors may
apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not
physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not
make the same type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did
not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of
the patent.

***

Whenever through error a person is named in an application for
patent as the inventor, or through an error an inventor is not
named in an application, and such error arose without any
deceptive intention on his part, the Director may permit the
application to be amended accordingly, under such terms as he
prescribes.

The Federal Circuit has interpreted §116 as follows:

This provision sets no explicit lower limit on the
quantum or quality of inventive contribution required for a
person to qualify as a joint inventor. Rather, a joint invention is
simply the product of a collaboration between two or more
persons working together to solve the problem addressed.
[citation omitted]. The determination of whether a person is a

39




*** PAGE 40 ***


joint inventor is fact specific, and no bright-line standard will
suffice in every case. [footnote omitted]. Nonetheless, our
precedent provides guidance as to what types of acts are, or are
not, sufficient in quantum and quality to establish joint
inventorship. One need not alone conceive of the entire
invention, for this would obviate the concept of joint
inventorship. However, a joint inventor must contribute in
some signiﬁcant manner to the conception of the invention.
[citations omitted]. As such, “each inventor must contribute to
the joint arrival at a definite and permanent idea of the
invention as it will be used in practice.” Burroughs Wellcome,
40 F.3d at 1229, 32 USPQ2d at 1921.

If a person supplies the required quantum of inventive
contribution, that person does not lose his or her status as a joint
inventor just because he or she used the services, ideas, and aid
of others in the process of perfecting the invention. [citation
omitted]. However, those others may also in appropriate
circumstances become joint inventors by their contributions. In
addition, a person is not precluded from being a joint inventor
simply because his or her contribution to a collaborative effort
is experimental. [citation omitted].

The basic exercise of the normal skill expected of one
skilled in the art, without an inventive act, also does not make
one a joint inventor. [citation omitted]. Therefore, a person will
not be a co-inventor if he or she does no more than explain to
the real inventors concepts that are well known and the current
state of the art. [citation orr1itted]. The case law thus indicates
that to be a joint inventor, an individual must make a
contribution to the conception of the claimed invention that is
not insigniﬁcant in quality, when that contribution is measured
against the dimension of the full invention.

Ia Oil & Chem. Co. v. Ewen, 123 F.3d 1466, 1473 (Fed. Cir. 1997). ']
zleral Circuit has also held that:

For persons to be joint inventors under Section 116, there must
be some element of joint behavior, such as collaboration or
working under common direction, one inventor seeing a
releva.nt report and building upon it or hearing another’s

40




*** PAGE 41 ***


suggestion at a meeting.

Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Procter & Gamble Distrib. C0., 973 F.2d 911, 917
(Fed. Cir. 1992).

Additionally, it is not enough for an alleged inventor to testify that he
contributed to the conception of the invention. Specifically, “[a]n inventor’s
testimony standing alone, is insufficient to prove conception-some form of
corroboration must be shown.” Price v. Symsek, 988 F.2d 1187, 1196.
Further, the unwitnessed and uncorroborated contemporary laboratory
notebook pages of an inventor generally are accorded no more weight than
the inventor’s subsequent testimony. Reese v. Hurst, 661 F.2d 1222, 1231
(CCPA 1981). The requirement for corroboration of an inventor’s testimony
stems from the concern that a party claiming inventorship might be tempted
to describe his actions in an unjustifiably self-serving manner in order to
obtain a patent or to maintain an existing patent. Shu-Hui Chen v.
Bouchard, 347 F.3d 1299, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, “[t]here is no
single formula that must be followed in proving corroboration.” Berry v.
Webb, 412 F.2d 261, 266 (CCPA 1969). Instead, whether an inventor’s
testimony is corroborated sufficiently should be evaluated using a “rule of
reason.” An evaluation of all pertinent evidence must be undertaken so that
a sound determination of the credibility of an inventor’s story can be made.
Price, 988 F.2d at 1187. Circumstantial evidence of an independent nature
may satisfy the corroboration requirement. Cooper, 154 F.3d at 1330. “In
the final analysis, each corroboration case must be decided on its own facts

with a View to deciding whether the evidence as a whole is persuasive.”

Berges v. Gottstein, 618 F.2d 771, 776 (CCPA 1980).

2. P&G ‘564 Patent Claims
The ‘564 patent contains fourteen (14) claims. ‘564 claims 1-12 are
directed to a detergent tablet. ‘564 claims 13-14 are directed to a method for
washing soiled articles in a washing machine comprising treating the articles
with an aqueous liquid having an effective amount of detergent tablet
dissolved or dispensed therein. (P&G Clean Copy of Claims, Paper 10).
The detergent tablet of P&G independent claim 1 contains a

compressed portion and a non-compressed portion wherein the compressed
portion comprises a mould and dissolves at a faster rate than the non-
compressed portion on a weight by weight basis measured using a SOTAX
dissolution test method. The non-compressed portion of the tablet is in the
form of a solid, gel or liquid form and is delivered into the mould of the

compressed portion and secured to the compressed portion. (Id.).

3. P&G Provides Clear and Convincing Corroborated
Evidence that McGregor Contributed to the Conception
of at Least One P&G Claim
P&G must establish that McGregor contributed to the conception of at
least one claim in a manner that was not insignificant in quality when that
contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention. The
burden of proof in infringement cases before the Federal Circuit has been
held to be clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Hess v. Advanced
Cardiovascular Sys. Inc., 106 F.3d 976, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Before this
agency however, a plausible argument can be made that the standard is a
preponderance of the evidence given that Section 116 is remedial in nature.

Cf In re Schmidt, 293 F.2d 274, 279 (CCPA 1961) (Section 116 is remedial
in nature and should be liberally construed in order to readily rectify errors).

42




*** PAGE 43 ***


We need not resolve the standard of proof in this agency proceeding as
P&G’s proofs meet both the preponderance of the evidence standard and the

clear and convincing standard.

a. McGregor Conceived of a Compressed Portion of
a Tablet Having a Mould and Dissolves at a Faster
Rate than a Non-Compressed Portion of the Tablet

P&G’s claimed invention requires a tablet having two portions, a
compressed portion and a non-compressed portion. The invention further
requires that the compressed portion have a mould and dissolve at a faster
rate than the non-compressed portion.

McGregor testifies that he “conceived of the idea of a dimple mould
in the [compressed] tablet for purpose of increasing the surface area of the
tablet.” (PX 1028, ‘H 6). McGregor also testifies that he conceived that the
dissolution rate of the compressed tablet may be increased by introducing
phosphate into the tablet matrix and increasing the hydration state of the
phosphate. (Id.). McGregor further testifies that he conceived of reducing
the pressure of the tablet press to increase the dissolution rate of the resulting

tablet. (Id.).

b. McGregor’s Contribution to Conception Was Not
Insignificant in Quality
The ‘594 patent highlights the advantage of having a compressed

region that dissolves at a faster rate as follows:

A further advantage of using a detergent tablet as described
herein, is the performance benefits which may be achieved in
being able to prepare a detergent tablet where the compressed
portion has a faster rate of dissolution than the non-compressed

43




*** PAGE 44 ***


portion.

(‘594, PX 1001, col. 2, 11. 10-14).

McGregor was responsible for the conception of the compressed
portion of the tablet where the compressed portion has a mould. Further,
McGregor was responsible for increasing the rate of dissolution of the
compressed portion, which is said to be a specific advantage of the tablets.
We find that McGregor’s contribution to conception of P&G’s claimed
tablets was not insignificant in quality as the tablet contains only two

portions and he conceived of at least one of them.

c. McGregor Collaborated with Named Inventors

McGregor worked on the automatic dishwashing team along with
Jeffrey Painter, Lynda Speed, and Sabine Metzger-Groom. The team, along
with Claire Goodier, was located at P&G’s Newcastle Technical Center.
(PX 1028, HI 11).

McGregor, Speed and Metzger-Groom testify that, as project team
members, they often met to discuss their data and results. (PX 1028, HIHI 4,
11, PX 1035, HI 6, and PX 1034, HI 4). Further, McGregor, Speed and Painter
testify that, prior to November 22, 1996, they had specific communications
regarding the developments reported in the McGregor’s ROI. (PX 1028, HI
11, PX 1035, HI 5 and PX 1036, HI 4). In particular, McGregor, Speed and
Painter testify that, prior to November 22, 1996, Speed shared her expertise
in the release of actives with McGregor and Painter shared his perspective of
using PEG and NB-base in a detergent tablet. (PX 1028, HI 11, PX 1035 , HI 5,
and PX 1306, HI 4). This is consistent with McGregor’s monthly reports and
ROI. Specifically, McGregor’s November 1, 1997 monthly report discusses

44




*** PAGE 45 ***


ET tablets and their dissolution but does not mention a delayed release
dimple, yet McGregor’s November 22, 1997 ROI describes using PEG and
NB-base in a solidified melt dimple.

Further evidence of collaboration between at least McGregor and
Speed on the claimed tablets is demonstrated by McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom’s regular communication with Claire Goodier, P&G’s
patent attorney, regarding the drafting of her patentability opinions, which
were based on McGregor’s ROI and which resulted in the ﬁling of the
application that issued as the ‘564 patent. (PX 1028, ‘H 11, PX 1035, ‘][‘j[ 6-7
and PX 1032, ‘H 5).

Based upon the evidence presented, we find that McGregor
collaborated with at least one inventor to solve the problem addressed,
which was the design and development of an automatic dishwashing tablet
with a delayed release non-compressed portion as compared to the

compressed portion.

d. McGregor’s Contribution to the Conception of the
Invention is Corroborated

We review the record as a whole to understand whether McGregor’s
contribution to conception is corroborated. Our review reveals a
straightforward and consistent story. Generally, the named inventors as well
as Alasdair McGregor and Sabine Metzger-Groom worked on the same
project team and were located at the same facility. McGregor was in regular
communication with the project members, and in particular, with Lynda
Speed with whom he generally communicated on a weekly basis. McGregor

conceived of a compressed detergent tablet (“ET tablet”) that had a

45




*** PAGE 46 ***


concavity on its surface to increase the dissolution of the compressed tablet.
Painter and Speed shared their expertise and perspective on using PEG and
NB-base in a detergent tablet. After conversations with Painter and Speed,
McGregor drafted an ROI that describes a dimpled tablet having a
compressed portion with hydrated phosphate that has a dimpled concavity
on its surface and a dimple portion having actives, such as NB-base, and a
controlled release PEG carrier. Further, McGregor, Speed and Metzger-
Groom worked with P&G’s attorney in the preparation of patentability
opinions based on “McGregor’ s” ROI and the subsequent application that
issued as the involved ‘564 patent.3
Further evidence of corroboration for McGregor’s development of the

ET tablets having a dimple mould and increased rate of dissolution may be
found in M.C. Addison and Metzger-Groom’s declarations and Metzger-
Groom’s January 1997 monthly report. Mr. Addison testiﬁes that he
supervised McGregor’s work, was well aware of his activities, and that he
contemporaneously signed the ROI and understood its signiﬁcance. (PX
1041). This is consistent with Metzger-Groom’s declaration and January
1997 monthly report which state that a procedure was developed with A. D.
McGregor to produce dimple tablets. (PX 1033, and PX 1034, ‘l[ 6).

e. Henkel’s Opposition to P&G’s Motion to Add
McGregor

Henkel presents numerous arguments in its opposition to adding
McGregor as an inventor. As explained below however, many of these

arguments are unrelated to the question of whether McGregor is a joint

3 Speciﬁc citations to the record for these findings may be found in the
preceding discussion regarding collaboration.

46




*** PAGE 47 ***


inventor.

i. Conception
Henkel Opposition 7 argues that:

McGregor’s alleged ROI neither demonstrates nor corroborates

that the alleged P&G inventors had conceived and reduced to

practice every limitation of any one of the three claims that in

the alternative deﬁne Count 2.

(Paper 100, p. 12). Henkel goes on to state that “[t]he alleged ROI does not
show that McGregor recognized every limitation of Count 2.”

Henkel’s arguments are not convincing. P&G’s motion requests that
McGregor be added as an inventor of the ‘564 patent. A person does not
need to reduce an invention to practice in order to be a joint inventor.
Further, joint inventorship requires a demonstration of a contribution to the
conception of the invention in a manner that was not insigniﬁcant in quality
as to a single claim and not a demonstration that the person to be added

conceived of every limitation of one of three claims of a Count, especially

where the Count includes claims from a third-party application.

ii. Authenticity & Corroboration

Henkel argues that the R01 is not properly authenticated. (Paper 100,
p. 14). Henkel argues that the signature of M. C. Addison on the ROI has
not been authenticated and there is “no indication that Addison witnessed the
document or understood its meaning and significance.” (Id.).

The Board’s rules provide that a party must file an objection within
ﬁve business days of service of the evidence. 37 C.F.R. § 41.155(b)(1). A

party who timely objected to the evidence must file a miscellaneous motion

to exclude to preserve its objection and the miscellaneous motion must
identify the objections in the record. 37 C.F.R. § 41.155 (c). Henkel did not
explain the timeliness of its objection nor ﬁle a miscellaneous motion to
exclude the disputed evidence. Accordingly, pursuant to the rules, we hold
that Henkel did not preserve its authenticity objection.

Additionally, P&G submitted a declaration from M. C. Addison that
authenticates the ROI. (PX 1041).4 Mr. Addison declares that he was
McGregor’s senior manager at the time and he “was well aware of the work
he [McGregor] was performing.” (Id. at ‘J[ 6). Mr. Addison declares that he
signed the ROI. (Id. at ‘][ 5). Mr. Addison further declares that “I did indeed
witness the ROI and understood its meaning and signiﬁcance.” (Id. at ‘][ 6).

Henkel argues that P&G has failed to offer proof to corroborate that
the work underlying the ROI was actually accomplished. (Paper 100, p. 14).
Joint inventorship focuses on a contribution to the conception of the
invention and does not require proof that experiments were conducted.

Here, Addison testifies that he witnessed the ROI and understood its
meaning and signiﬁcance. This testimony is consistent with the fact that
Addison was McGregor’s supervisor and that he was well aware of the work
McGregor was performing. Additional corroboration is provided by
Metzger-Groom’s January 1997 monthly report and her declaration, which
describe tablets made according to the method developed by McGregor. It is
also consistent with the February 14, 1997 patentability opinion prepared by

4 Henkel’s Request for Oral Argument (Paper 107) states that an issue
to be considered at the hearing was whether P&G exhibits 1040-1043 are
admissible noting that they were served with P&G Reply 5 rather than with
P&G’s case in chief. Henkel however, did not raise this issue at oral
argument. We do not exclude the exhibits as Henkel failed to fully develop
its objection to PX 1040-1043.

Claire Goodier, which was written to “M C Addison” and identiﬁes the ROI
(#2028) as McGregor’s. (PX 1030).

iii. Joint Inventorship

Henkel argues that McGregor, Speed and Painter are not joint
inventors of the ‘564 patent because P&G failed to demonstrate that Speed
and Painter contributed to the conception. (Paper 100, p. 15). For example,
Henkel states:

None of these vague references offer clear and convincing

proof of Speed’s signiﬁcant contribution to the alleged

conception of the invention.

(Id. at p. 16). Henkel also states ‘[t]he facts surrounding Painter’s
contribution to inventorship are even less credible.” (Id.). Henkel concludes
that there is no showing that McGregor, Speed and Painter collaborated on
the invention and if the ROI is relied upon for proof of conception then the
inventorship of the ‘564 patent is incorrect and invalid under 35 U.S.C.

§ 102(f). (Id. at 17-18).

P&G’s motion seeks to add McGregor as a joint inventor. Henkel
acknowledges that “[i]nventorship of an issued patent is presumed to be
correct.” (Id. at 15). Hence, there is a presumption that Speed and Painter
contributed to the conception of at least one claim of P&G’s ‘564 patent.
P&G was entitled to rely upon this presumption in support of its motion and
was not required to provide evidence to support the presumption. Further,
Henkel fails to identify sufﬁcient and credible evidence of record to rebut
the presumption that Speed and Painter provided a signiﬁcant contribution to
the conception of at least one claim of the patent.

Henkel alleges that P&G failed to demonstrate that McGregor

49




*** PAGE 50 ***


collaborated with the named inventors on the invention. We disagree. As
discussed in detail above, McGregor, Speed and Painter as well as Metzger-
Groom and Goodier were all on the same automatic dishwashing project
team at the Newcastle Technical Center. McGregor, Speed and Metzger-
Groom all testify that they met regularly as project team members and
discussed their data and results. Further, Speed and Painter both testify that
they were in communication with McGregor regarding the invention
described in the ROI prior to its drafting. Further evidence of collaboration
is provided by McGregor, Speed, and Metzger-Groom’s regular
communication with Goodier regarding the drafting of the patentability
opinions based on the ROI.
Henkel alleges that, if the ROI is relied upon for proof of conception

then McGregor, Speed and Painter cannot be joint inventors and the ‘564
patent is invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 102(f). We will note that “validity” is
not an issue in an interference. Rather, patentability is an issue. As stated
above, P&G was not required to provide evidence of Speed and Painter’s
contribution to conception of at least one claim. To the extent Henkel
wanted the Board to consider this issue, Henkel could have, but did not, ﬁle

a motion for unpatentability based upon § 102(f).

iv. Henkel Alleges McGregor’s ROI Fails to
Support a Reduction to Practice
Henkel Opposition 7 provides a long discussion of why McGregor’s
ROI did not establish an actual reduction to practice. For example, Henkel

states:

P&G has failed to prove that McGregor’s ROI establishes
reduction to practice of a P&G invention meeting all limitations

50




*** PAGE 51 ***


of Count 2 before P&G’s priority date of November 26, 1997,

which is the filing date of its U.S. Provisional patent

Application Serial No. 60/066,593 upon which the ‘564 patent

claims beneﬁt.

(Paper 100, p. 21).

P&G Motion 7 attempts to add McGregor as an inventor on the ‘564
patent. A person seeking to be named a joint inventor on a patent is not
required to demonstrate an actual reduction to practice, let alone an earlier
actual reduction to practice of a Count.

Inventorship is a question of law premised on underlying questions of
fact. Ethicon, 135 F.3d at 1460. We hold that P&G has provided clear and
sufficient evidence that McGregor collaborated with at least one named
inventor and contributed in a not insigniﬁcant manner to the conception of at
least one claim of the ‘564 patent. We further hold that his contribution is
corroborated by the evidence of record. We grant P&G Motion 7 to add

McGregor as an inventor of the ‘564 patent.

B. P&G Motion 5: Priority of Invention

P&G Motion 5 (Paper 93) moves for judgment on priority of
invention as against Henkel. Henkel opposes. (Paper 98).

A party may demonstrate that it was first to invent by establishing
either (1) an earlier date of reduction to practice, or (2) an earlier date of
conception, but a later date of reduction to practice, coupled with a
reasonable diligence to a reduction to practice from (a) a time prior to the
opponent’s conception until (b) the party’s reduction to practice is achieved.
Eaton v. Evans, 204 F.3d 1094, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Mahurkar v. C. R.
Bard, Inc., 79 F.3d 1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

51




*** PAGE 52 ***


Both parties have attempted to demonstrate that they were the first to
invent based upon an earlier date of actual reduction to practice and have not
relied upon diligence towards an actual reduction to practice.5 (Papers 92
and 93). Actual reduction to practice requires that an inventor demonstrate
that he contemporaneously appreciated an embodiment that met all the
limitations of the interference count. Cooper v. Goldfarb, 240 F.3d 1378,
1386 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit has held that Henkel proved a
corroborated appreciation by no than later May 1997. Henkel at 1376.
Accordingly, the critical date for P&G’s actual reduction to practice is no
later than May 1997.

1. Case Law on Actual Reduction to Practice
Whether an actual reduction to practice has been achieved is a

question of law which is resolved on the basis of underlying facts. Estee
Lauder, Inc. v. L'0real, S.A., 129 F.3d 588, 592 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
Speciﬁcally, in an interference proceeding, a party seeking to establish an
actual reduction to practice must satisfy a two-prong test: (1) the party
constructed an embodiment that met every limitation of the interference
count, and (2) the embodiment operated for its intended purpose. Eaton, 204
F.3d at 1097. As to the second prong, there must be some recognition of

5 Both Henkel’s and P&G’s Preliminary Statements allege diligence towards
a reduction to practice. (Henkel Papers 34 and 89, P&G, Paper 90).
Henkel’s Preliminary Statement alleges that an active diligence towards a
reduction to practice began March 6, 1997. (Paper 34, ‘][ 6). As neither
pa.rty’s motion for priority argued diligence, we find that the parties waived
this issue. (See, e.g., Henkel Motion 4, Paper 92, Conclusion, pages 23-24,
P&G Motion 4, Paper 93, Conclusion, p. 27). Furthermore, Henkel’s
alleged diligence is after P&G’s actual reduction to practice rendering the
issue moot.

52




*** PAGE 53 ***


successful testing prior to the critical date for an invention to be reduced to
practice. Thus, an actual reduction to practice “does not occur until an
inventor, or perhaps his agent, knows that the invention will work for its

intended purpose.” Estee Lauder, Inc., 129 F.3d at 593.

2. Count 2

Count 2 is the sole count in interference and includes three
alternatives, P&G ‘564 claim 1, Henkel ‘434 claim 41 and Henkel ‘578
claim 44. (Paper No. 87, ‘j[ 1).

Henkel ‘434 claim 41 requires a detergent tablet having a compressed
region and a solidified solution or melt region. The compressed region has a
recess and the dissolution rate of the compressed region is greater than the
dissolution rate of the solidiﬁed solution or melt region. The solution or
melt region is at least partially retained in the recess and is affixed to the
compressed region by hardening. The solution or melt region comprises no

more than 40% of the surface of the detergent tablet. (Decision - Rehearing,
Paper No. 86, ‘]I 8).

3. P&G Constructed Dimpled Tablets within the Scope of
Count 2
P&G contends that both McGregor and Metzger-Groom made tablets

falling within the scope of Count 2. Specifically, P&G alleges that
McGregor made the tablets described in his November 1997 ROI and that
Metzger-Groom made the tablets described in her January 1997 monthly
report. (Paper 93, p. 14). As to recognizing the utility of the invention,
P&G directs the Board’s attention to Metzger-Groom’s testing of the dimple

tablet described in her January 1997 monthly report. Hence, our focus for

53




*** PAGE 54 ***


actual reduction to practice is on Metzger-Groom’s making and testing of
the tablet and the inventor’s purported appreciation that the invention
worked for its intended purpose. Yet, to place Metzger-Groom’s monthly
report in context, we first look at the evidence that describes the work
leading up to her report.

Beginning in April 1996, McGregor’s monthly reports describe his
ideas on increasing the dissolution rate of phosphate tablets. (PX 1023).
The April report identiﬁes three potential ways of increasing the dissolution:
1) increase the hydration state of the phosphate; 2) incorporating a
disintegrant into the phosphate matrix; and 3) contouring the tablet surface.
(Id.). The report goes on to state that contouring the surface can be achieved
using dirnpled punch heads and that they are preparing a tablet punch head
for development work. (Id.).

McGregor’s May 1996 report states that the key lead for improving
the dissolution rate of the tablets was to increase the hydration state of the
phosphate. (PX 1024). The report provides a table describing what appears
to be several tests balancing the tabletting pressure and the hydration state of
the phosphate and measuring total dissolution rate. (Id.). The report also
states that process trials have been completed with acceptance testing of a
tablet press with the testing demonstrating that the press was well capable of
meeting the project success criteria for tablet weight and hardness. (Id.).

McGregor’s November 1996 report states that:

The European Tablet (ET) now dissolves at a sufﬁcient rate into
the wash so as to meet the project performance criteria.
Increased phosphate hexa-hydrate conversion and reduced
hardness have achieved this increase in dissolution rate.

(PX 1025).

54




*** PAGE 55 ***


McGregor, Speed and Painter were all working on the same automatic
dishwashing project team at the same facility. All three of them testify that,
prior to the date of McGregor’s ROI, Speed and Painter shared their
perspectives on the release of actives from a tablet. (PX 1028, ‘JI ll, PX
1035, ‘ll 5, PX 1036, ‘j[ 4). In particular, McGregor and Painter testify that
McGregor asked Painter about materials that would start to melt/dissolve at
various temperatures and that Painter shared his perspective on the use of
PEG and NB-base in the tablet. (PX 1028, 11 11, PX 1036, ‘II 4).

McGregor’s ROI has a typewritten date of November 22, 1996 and
has a received stamp of November 29, 1996 in the upper right hand corner.
(PX 1009, p. 1). The ROI provides a descriptive title that refers to djmpled
tablets for delivering raw materials via an inert carrier to maintain the raw
material activity. (Id.). The ROI states that highly active ingredients, e.g.,
NB-base, can retain their activity by using a dimple approach or spray-on
approach. (Id. at 2-3). The dimple approach is described as a tablet having
a concave face or multiple dimples. A reactive molten mix of reactive
material and inert carrier is dropped onto the concave surface of the tablet
and allowed to cool or a solid mix is pressed into the concave surface of the
tablet. (Id. at 2). The ROI states that the inert carrier is chosen carefully so
that it only starts to melt/dissolve at a particular temperature in the wash
cycle. (Id. at 3).

The ROI provides three specific examples of dirnpled tablets and their
method of manufacture. (Id. at 5-8). The three tablets comprise a
compressed region (tabletted granules) and a solidified melt region (PEG
heated until molten, mixed with an active, and dropped into the tablet

dimple). The major component of the compressed region in each tablet is
12% moisture phosphate (i.e., hydrated phosphate). (Id.). The ROI provides

55




*** PAGE 56 ***


a detailed schematic for the ET tabletting process. The “ET Dimpled
Tablet” formed by the process has a diameter of 32 mm and a height of 13.4
mm. (Id. at 8, upper right hand comer of schematic). The upper surface of
the compressed region contains a concavity, i.e., dimple. The concavity is
formed with an upper tablet punch that can be 10 mm or 20 mm in diameter.
(Id. at 5-7). The ROI states that, in November 1996, initial laboratory scale
work was carried out to identify a suitable carrier, i.e., PEG 10,000, and
performance benefits. (Id. at 9).

The tablets in McGregor’s ROI fall within the scope of Count 2. For
reasons of convenience, we compare the detergent tablets described in
McGregor’s ROI with the limitations presented in Henkel ‘434 claim 41,
which forms a part of Count 2.

McGregor’s ROI exempliﬁed detergent tablets have a “compressed
region.” Specifically, the compressed region comprises granules having
12% moisture phosphate that are “tabletted @ 7 tonf to a hardness of 21kg.”
(PX 1009, Examples 1-3, pages 5-7).

The ROI detergent tablets have a “solidified solution or melt region.”
Specifically, the ROI detergent tablets can be prepared using a “molten mix
of reactive raw material and inert carrier [that] is dropped onto the surface of
the tablet and allowed to cool.” (PX 1009, p. 2). R01 Examples 1-3 all
describe heating a PEG (polyethylene glycol) polymer until molten, mixing
it with a detergent active and then dropping the liquid mix into the tablet
dimple. (PX 1009, Examples 1-3, pages 5-7).

The compressed region of the exemplified ROI detergent tablets
contains “a recess.” The ROI states that the surface of the tablet, which is
the compressed region, can be tabletted with a concave face “dimple.” (Id.
at 2). R01 Examples 1-3 all describe the use of an upper punch to create a

56




*** PAGE 57 ***


hemispherical dimple. (Id. at pages 5-7). Fmther, the ROI schematic
diagram of the automatic dishwashing ET tabletting process depicts an ET
dimpled tablet having a recess on its upper surface. (Id. at p. 8).

The exempliﬁed ROI detergent tablets have a dissolution rate of the
compressed region that is greater than the dissolution rate of the melt region.
This property is demonstrated by Metzger-Groom’s testing of a tablet made
according to the ROI and confirmed by the testimony of David Smith, who
has a Bachelor’s degree with honors in Chemical Engineering. (PX 1029, ‘l[
4). Mr. Smith testiﬁes that he is a person of ordinary skill in the art and that
the tablets exempliﬁed in McGregor’s ROI provide “a physical embodiment
that meets all the claim limitations of the claims encompassing Count 2.”
(Id. at ‘J[‘][ 4 and 9). We credit Smith’s testimony, for as explained below, it is
consistent with the contents of the ROI.

Mr. Smith testifies that during the course of the interference he, with
his assistant, essentially reproduced a dimpled detergent tablet according to
Example 2 of the ROI. (PX 1029, ‘][ 9). Specifically, Mr. Smith’s dimpled
tablets are said to be identical to those of ROI Example 2 except for minor
substitutions in the compressed region components that do not materially
affect the dissolution rate of the dimpled tablet or the compressed region of
the tablet. (Id. at ‘][ 10). Mr. Smith testifies that the dimpled tablet exhibited
a dissolution rate of 0.28 g/min for the compressed region and 0.21 g/min for
the solidiﬁed solution or melt region. (Id. at ‘J[ 9). Based upon these results,
Mr. Smith concluded that the compressed region of the tablet dissolved at a
faster rate than the non-compressed portion. (Id.). We give Mr. Smith’s
testimony no weight as to the question of whether the inventors’ conceived
of this tablet property or contemporaneously appreciated this property.
Instead we rely upon Mr. Smith’s testing and testimony solely to

57




*** PAGE 58 ***


demonstrate that post-filing testing was not inconsistent with P&G’s
contemporaneous testing and appreciation, which is discussed later in this
opinion.

The exemplified ROI detergent tablets are made by delivering a melt
into the recess on the surface of the compressed region and are partially
retained in this recess. In particular, the exemplified tablets are made by
1) heating the PEG until molten, 2) mixing the molten PEG with an active
and, 3) dropping the liquid mix into the tablet dimple. (PX 1009, Examples
1-3, pages 5-7). Further, the schematic blockﬂow diagram of the ET
tabletting process depicts the solidiﬁed melt as retained in the dimple. (Id. at
p. 8).

The exempliﬁed ROI detergent tablets have a solidified solution or
melt region afﬁxed to the compressed region by hardening. The ROI’s
molten PEG mixture is dropped into the dimple on the surface of the
compressed region of the tablet. One of ordinary skill in the art would
understand that the PEG mixture, upon cooling, is affixed to the compressed
region by hardening. (PX 1029, ‘II 13, p. 11).

The exempliﬁed ROI detergent tablets have a solidiﬁed solution or
melt region that comprises no more than 40% of the surface of the detergent
tablet. The ROI identiﬁes the dimensions of the exemplified tablets,
specifically the diameter of the tablets, the diameter of the concavity and the
height of the tablets. (Id. at Examples 1-3 and Schematic, pages 5-8). Even
a cursory review of the depicted tablet below, which appears on page 8 of
the schematic, demonstrates that the solidiﬁed melt in the concavity of the

compressed region will be well below the 40% level required by the Count.

58




*** PAGE 59 ***

Further, Mr. Smith conﬁrms what is clear to the casual observer and
calculates the surface area of the solidiﬁed melt tablet depicted above as
only 8.7% of the surface area of the entire tablet. (PX 1029, ‘]I 13, p. 11).
Thus, McGregor’s dimple tablets were specifically designed with a melt
region having a surface area well below the 40% recited in the count.

Metzger-Groom testifies that the dimple tablets she made, and
described in her Januaiy 1997 report, were made according to the method
developed by McGregor as detailed in McGregor’s ROI. (PX 1034, ‘H 6).
Her testimony is consistent with the descriptions provided in her January
1997 report, which itself is consistent with the dimple tablets described in
McGregor’s ROI. We credit Metzger-Groom’s testimony and find that the
dimple tablets described in her monthly report were made according to the
procedure described in McGregor’s ROI.

Metzger-Groom’s dimple tablets, like the ROI tablets, fall within the
scope of Count 2. Specifically, Metzger-Groom’s dimple tablets were made
according to the procedure described in the ROI. For example, Metzger-
Groom’s dimple tablets use PEG 3000 and NB-base “to fill the dimple,”

which is consistent with the examples and schematic of the ROI where the

59




*** PAGE 60 ***


compressed regions concavity (“dimple”) is filled with a molten mixture of
PEG and an active ingredient. (Compare PX 1033, PX 1034, ‘][ 6 and PX
1009, Examples 1-3 and schematic). We find that Metzger-Groom’s dimple
tablets fall within the scope of Count 2, for the reasons explained above with
respect to the ROI dimple tablets and in View of Metzger-Groom’s testimony
and report identifying that the dimple tablets were made according to
McGregor’s ROI where PEG 3000 was melted together with NB-base
particles to fill the dimple.

We ﬁnd that P&G has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate by
at least a preponderance of the evidence that the dimpled tablets described in
Metzger-Groom’s January 1997 report constitute an embodiment within the

scope of Count 2.

3. P&G Tested the Dimpled Tablets and McGregor and/or
Speed Appreciated that the Invention Worked for its
Intended Purpose

Metzger-Groom’s January 1, 1997 report states that the dimple tablets
are storage stable. Additionally, the report states that the performance of the
dimple tablet is slightly worse than regular tablets, i.e., 61% carotenoid stain
removal for ET tablet with dimple versus 65-68% for regular ET tablets.
The report states that the reduced performance may stem from the “slower
release of NB-base from the dimple vs. regular tablets.” The report
identifies potential future designs of the tablet as including lower molecular
weight PEG to release the active in the melt region dimple faster than the
actives in the compressed region of the tablet.

Metzger-Groom testiﬁes that the dimple table in her report was made
according to the “method developed by Alasdair McGregor as detailed in the

60




*** PAGE 61 ***


ROI (Ex. 1009).” (PX 1034, ‘j[ 6). Metzger-Groom confirmed that the
dimple tablet of her report achieved success by demonstrating a 61%
carotenoid stain removal. (Id.).

Metzger-Groom testifies that, as required by management, it was her
standard practice to publish her monthly report within at least one week after
the end of the month. (Id. at ‘]I 5). She testifies that, based on her customary
practice, she likely published her report by January 7, 1997. (Id.). Further,
Metzger-Groom testifies that Speed was her manager at the time she
conducted the work and that she reported the data of the subject monthly
directly to Speed after generating the data. (Id.). Metzger-Groom also
testifies that she, Speed and McGregor were on the same project team and
“met often discussing our data and results on a regular basis, if not at least a
weekly basis.” (Id.).

McGregor testifies that, by at least early January 1997, he appreciated
that a detergent tablet made according to the procedure described in his ROI
worked for its intended purpose as evidenced by Metzger-Groom’s monthly
report. (PX 1028, ‘]I 14). McGregor testifies that he recalls reading the
report at least in early January 1997 based on his standard practice of
reading monthly reports of his project team members shortly after they are
published. (Id.). McGregor also testifies that by February 14, 1997 he fully
appreciated that the use of PEG 3,000 (which was used in Metzger-Groom’s
tablets) equates to a slower dissolution rate for the non-compressed region of
his tablets. (PX 1042, ‘J[ 8).

We credit McGregor’s testimony regarding appreciation as it is
sufficiently corroborated by, and consistent with, the evidence of record.
For example, Metzger-Groom’s monthly report identifies the tested tablets

as successfully removing carotenoid stains and as having a slower

61




*** PAGE 62 ***


dissolution rate for the non-compressed region (dimple) as opposed to the
compressed region. Metzger-Groom testiﬁes that, as project team members
working on the same project in the same facility, she met often with
McGregor to discuss data and results. Further corroboration is provided by
Claire Goodier who testiﬁes that she met with McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom before issuing her February 14, 1997 patentability opinion
and that before this date it was well established that the dissolution rate of
the non-compressed region is decreased by the use of PEG. (PX 1032, ‘]I 6).

4. Henkel’s Opposition

Henkel opposes P&G motion for priority alleging that P&G has failed
to prove conception and reduction to practice earlier than P&G’ s
constructive reduction to practice date of November 26, 1997. (Henkel
Opposition 5, Paper 98, p. 14). Henke1’s opposition is limited to contesting
P&G’s conception and contemporaneous appreciation of the dissolution rate
limitation of Count 2. Indeed, Henkel Opposition 5 provides an Appendix A
listing the requirements of each alternative embodiment of the Count and
objects only to the dissolution rate limitation. (Id. at Appendix A). For
example, Henkel’s opposition with respect to ‘434 claim 41, which is an

embodiment of Count 2, is reproduced below:

(Id.). Henkel’s opposition arguments are considered below.

a. The ROI

Henkel argues that McGregor’s ROI fails to demonstrate that P&G’s
inventors had conceived and reduced to practice every limitation of any one
of the three claims that, in the alternative, define Count 2. (Id. at 15).
Henkel’s argument is moot as we don’t rely upon McGregor’s R01 to
demonstrate a complete conception of an embodiment within the scope of
the Count or to prove that McGregor made the tablets reported in the ROI.

Henkel argues that McGregor’s R01 is inadmissible for lack of
authenticity. (Id. at 16). As discussed above, Henkel did not preserve its
objection to the authenticity of the ROI. 37 C.F.R. § 41.155(c).
Additionally, the testimony of Addison authenticates the ROI. (PX 1041, ‘]I
‘j[ 5, 6).

Henkel argues that McGregor’s ROI lacks corroboration. (Paper 98,
p. 16). In particular, Henkel argues that P&G offers no proof to corroborate
that the work underlying the alleged ROI was actually accomplished and that
the statements in the R01 are suspect since McGregor’s notebooks are lost.

*** PAGE 64 ***


(Id. at 17). We have not relied upon the R01 to prove that the work recited
therein was actually conducted. Rather, we have relied upon the ROI as
describing dimple tablets and describing a method of manufacturing the
dimple tablets. However, to the extent corroboration of the work reported in
the R01 is necessary, we identify Mr. Addison as providing credible
testimony that, as McGregor’s supervisor, he was well aware of the work
that McGregor was performing and that he witnessed the ROI and
understood its meaning and signiﬁcance. (PX 1041, HI ‘J[ 5, 6).

Henkel argues that McGregor, Speed and Painter are not joint
inventors as Speed and Painter did not participate in the alleged conception.
(Paper 98, p. 17-20). In particular, Henkel takes the position that if the ROI
is relied upon for proof of conception then McGregor, Speed and Painter

carmot be joint inventors and the ‘564 patent is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.

§102(f). (Id. at 20). Henkel’s position does not add up to a convincing
argument. Joint inventorship can be established by a demonstration of a
contribution to the conception of the invention in a manner that was not
insigniﬁcant in quality as to a single claim of the patent. The issue raised by
P&G Motion 5 is priority of invention as to the Count. Additionally, as
noted earlier, Henkel could have, but did not, file a motion for
unpatentability based upon § 102(f) where it would have had the burden of
coming forward with evidence to rebut the presumption that Speed and
Painter contributed to the conception of at least one claim of the patent.
Henkel argues that the ROI does not support a reduction to practice of
the invention. (Id.). For example, Henkel argues that the ROI Example 2
offers no indication that the measurement of the dissolution rate was
attempted. (Id. at 21). The Count however, does not require a measurement

of speciﬁc dissolution rates. Henkel Corp. at 1374 (“The correct

64




*** PAGE 65 ***


requirement of the count calls for a showing of an appreciation by the
inventors simply that the dissolution rate of the compressed region is greater
than the dissolution rate of the other region.”). Further, as discussed above,
we have not relied upon the ROI as proof that the work recited therein was

actually conducted.

b. Metzger-Groom’s Report
Henkel argues that the Metzger-Groom January 1997 monthly report
(PX 1033) fails to establish a reduction to practice as “no alleged P&G
inventor recognized all limitations of Count 2.” (Id. at 22). Henkel goes on
to state:

At least as reported (P&G once again did not produce

contemporaneous documentation in the form of Metzger-

Groom’s laboratory notebooks), Metzger-Groom did not

determine the dissolution rates of the tablet by the so-called

SOTAX method or any equivalent. Moreover, Metzger-Groom

does not state that she appreciated the limitation in the

invention of differential dissolution rate (see Ex. 1034), so any

arguments P&G might make regarding inurement of the

invention to the beneﬁt of the alleged inventors would likewise

fail.

(Id.).

Contrary to Henkel’s arguments, the Count does not require a
determination of the speciﬁc dissolution rates of the tablet. Instead, the
Count merely requires a showing that an inventor appreciated that the
dissolution rate of the compressed region is greater than the other region.
Henkel is correct however, that Metzger-Groom does not explicitly aver that
she or the inventors appreciated the speciﬁc dissolution rate limitation at the

time of her experiment but such a formulaic afﬁrmation is unnecessary

65




*** PAGE 66 ***


under the facts of this case. This is not a case where there is a signiﬁcant
danger that the inventors accidentally created something new; rather, they
set out to design detergent tablets having a particular structure and
composition and did so. The only question is whether they appreciated the
discernible property that was observed and reported by their fellow project
team member in her monthly report. Speciﬁcally, the dissolution rate
limitation is a discernible property of the invention that was directly
observed and reported in Metzger-Groom’s January 1997 report. (PX 1033).
Metzger-Groom worked under the supervision of one of the inventors,
Speed, and testiﬁes that she was in regular communication regarding her
data and results with both Speed and McGregor. Further, McGregor testiﬁes
that, by at least February 14, 1997, he appreciated that use of PEG 3,000
(which was used in Metzger-Groom’s tablets) equates to a slower
dissolution rate for the non—compressed region of his tablets. McGregor’ s
testimony is consistent with Metzger-Groom’s testimony and monthly report
as well as the testimony of Claire Goodier who testiﬁes that she met with
McGregor, Speed and Metzger-Groom before issuing her February 14, 1997
patentability opinion and that before this date it was well established that the
dissolution rate of the non-compressed region is decreased by the use of
PEG. (PX 1032, ‘j[ 6). To require more speciﬁc declarations than P&G has
proffered would be in contravention of the Federal Circuit’s holding in
Mycogen that an inventor can appreciate an embodiment within the scope of
a count without enunciating the precise language of the count. Mycogen,
243 F.3d at 1336.
Henkel directs our attention to the stated purposes of Metzger-

Groom’s dimple tablet experiments, which were to improve the stability and

rate of delivery of Tergitol and to improve the stability of NB-base in

66




*** PAGE 67 ***


tablets. (Paper 98, pages 22-23). Henkel also directs our attention to the
statements in the report that the hypothesis that the early release of NB-base
is critical to performance is being investigated and that such early release
may be obtained by using lower molecular weight PEG. Henkel states that
these statements in the monthly report teach away “in the strongest possible
terms” from P&G’s inventors’ appreciation of the required dissolution rate.
(Id. at 23).

Henkel is correct that the stated purpose of the test was not to
determine the dissolution rates of the compressed and non-compressed
regions. Again, this is not a case where there is a significant danger that the
inventors accidentally created something new; rather, they set out to design
detergent tablets where the structure and composition of the tablet were
designed to control the dissolution of the inert carrier and actives in the non-
compressed region as compared to the compressed region. As such, the
reported “purpose” of the test does not detract from the ROI’s statements
that a PEG carrier is selected to control the dissolution of the dimple or the
observation in Metzger-Groom’s monthly report regarding a slower release
of NB-base in the dimple versus a regular tablet.

Henkel is incorrect in suggesting that the monthly report’s statement
of future efforts teaches away from the inventors’ appreciation of the
dissolution rate limitation. Instead, it teaches the opposite. Specifically, the
monthly report hypothesizes that stain removal could be improved by a
faster release, i.e., faster dissolution rate, for the non-compressed dimple
portion of the tablet. The monthly report states that a lower molecular
weight PEG could be used to ensure that the NB-base is quickly released and
identifies a system using low molecular weight PEG in combination with a

fizzy matrix to control the release of the NB-base prior to the release of

67




*** PAGE 68 ***


components from the compressed region. This is entirely consistent with the
reported observation that the NB-base in the noncompressed portion of the
tested tablet dissolved slower than the NB-base in the regular compressed
portion of the tablet. Further, the fact that a product can be improved upon
does not mean that the product is a failure. For instance, as both parties are
aware, P&G’s Tide® brand of detergent is useful in cleaning clothes but it
has consistently been updated and improved upon over the years.

Henkel contends that P&G seeks to establish a reduction to practice
nunc pro tunc. (Paper 98, p. 23). As discussed above, P&G’s testing and
appreciation of an embodiment within the scope of Count 2 was prior to
Henkel’s critical date and does not involve a nunc pro tunc reduction to
practice.

Additionally, Henkel states that it was unable to decipher Metzger-
Groom’s report stating, for example, “no description of an ‘ET’ tablet is
offered.” (Paper 98, p. 22). The report however, states that the dimple
tablets were made according to the procedure developed with McGregor.
Likewise, Metzger-Groom testified that the dimple tablets were made
according to the method described in McGregor’s ROI. (PX 1034, ‘]I 6).
McGregor’s ROI provides a detailed schematic for the “ADW (ET)
Tabletting Process” and McGregor’s November 1996 monthly report refers
to the “European Tablet (ET).” (PX 1009, p. 8 and PX 1025). Based upon
the evidence of record, we find that Henkel has failed to establish that one of
ordinary skill in the art would have been unable to decipher Metzger-
Groom’s monthly report.

We hold that P&G has demonstrated at least one of its inventors
appreciated that an embodiment of the count worked for its intended purpose

by no later than February 14, 1997. We grant P&G Motion 5 and hold that

68




*** PAGE 69 ***


P&G’s actual reduction to practice date is February 14, 1997, which is prior
to Henkel’s actual reduction to practice date of no later than May 1997.
Priority of invention is awarded against Henkel.

It is:

Ordered that P&G Miscellaneous Motion 7 (Paper 94) for correction
of inventorship is granted.

Further Ordered that P&G Substantive Motion 5 (Paper 93) for
judgment on priority of invention as to Count 2, the sole count in

interference, is granted.

ON REHEARING

 

Before THOMAS, and TORCZON, ' ' t t" e a n

Judges.

JERRY SMITH,

TORCZON, Administrative Patent Judge.
DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Appellant's request on rehearing for withdrawal (Paper

No. 19 at 2) of our prior decision on appeal (Paper No. 18) is
denied.
BACKGROUND
Appellant discloses a semiconductor device using fuses or
diodes to protect the remaining circuitry from electrostatic

damage. (Paper No. 1 at 2-3 and 5-6.) In the decision under

rehearing, we reversed two rejections based on our finding

that a resistor would not meet the claim requirement for an

"opening structure". We affirmed, however, the rejection of

_TA

1 Attorney docket no. P94,0978.

*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603 Page 2
Application No. 08/243,839

all claims under 35 U.S.C. § 103 in view of Appellant's
admitted prior art (Figures 5 and 6) and:

Ukai et al. (Ukai) 5,068,748 26 Nov. 1991
Our conclusion of obviousness was based in part on our finding
that a diode, such as those taught in Ukai, would meet the
claim requirement for an opening structure. According to
Appellant,

The Board then asserted that it would have been

obvious to combine the diodes of Ukai with the

structure of the admitted prior art in order to

result in the claimed invention. The fundamental

error in this analysis is that Ukai does not teach

or suggest the use of an “opening structure" as

claimed because diodes, which are structures that

prevent the transmission of electrical current in a
single direction, are not suggestive of opening

structures that prevent the transmission of

electrical current in either direction.
(Paper No. 19 at 1.) Note that Appellant is not contesting
the combination but rather the finding that diodes are opening
structures and the claim construction that permits that
finding.

DISCUSSION

As we noted in our decision (Paper No. 18 at 2), during
prosecution a claim must be construed as broadly as is
reasonably possible in light of the disclosure and the related

prior art. E.g., In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d

1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989). This practice reflects the broad




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603 Page 3

Application No. 08/243,839

latitude applicants have during prosecution to amend their
claims to clarify their intent and to avoid prior art. Id;;
In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1056, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1029 (Fed.
Cir. 1997).

The starting point for claim construction is always the
language of the claim itself. Comark Comm. Inc. v. Harris
Q9;p;, 156 F.3d 1182, 1186, 48 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir.
1998); Desper Prods. Inc. v. Qsound Labs. Inc., 157 F.3d 1325,
1332, 48 USPQ2d 1088, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Appellant stated

that all of the appealed claims stood or fell together.

(Paper No. 11 at 3.) Pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7), we
selected claim 4 as representative of the group. (Paper No.
18 at 1-2.) Claim 4 requires "an opening structure in said

connection pattern." The claim itself does not define
"opening structure" beyond the functional limitation that it
open something at sometime and the structural limitation that
it be in the connection pattern. Nothing in the language of
claim 4 excludes a diode as an opening structure or requires
the use of a fuse pattern. Both the specification and the
related art support our construction that an opening structure
may be a diode.

In the specification, Appellant explains the opening

structure as follows:




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603 Page
Application No. 08/243,839

The present invention is characterized in that the

connection pattern has opening structures for

dealing with an external overcurrent provided on

both sides of the division lines. Specifically[,]

the opening structures are constituted by fuse

patterns. Alternatively, the opening structure may

be constituted by diodes having a reduced gate

width.
(Paper No. l at 6, emphasis added; see also Paper No. l at ll
(explaining how the diodes open in response to an overcurrent
before the transistors of the internal circuit are damaged).)
The genus of opening structures is bounded by the fact that

each "must have a property such that predetermined

conductivity is maintained unless an overcurrent is applied

and it opens when such an overcurrent is applied." (Paper No.
l at l2.) As indicated, however, a diode meets these
requirements. The specification expressly contradicts

Appellant's argument on rehearing that the opening structure
cannot be a diode.

Ukai also supports our construction of opening
structures. Appellant has not contested our finding (Paper
No. l8 at 4) that Ukai is directed to the same problem (see
Ukai at 2:20-3:36), i.e., protecting display circuits from
electrostatic discharge. Ukai uses coupling elements 42 in

connection patterns between two guard rings 31, 32 to protect

display circuits from static electricity. (4:49—60.) The




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603 Page 5
Application No. 08/243,839

coupling elements may be non—linear elements, e.g., diodes.
(4:37—44.) As we noted in our decision (Paper No. 18 at 4),
Appellant's brief on appeal did not address these non—linear
elements. Ukai's diodes shunt static discharge from
terminals 20 to the internal short circuiting bus 32. As
Appellant notes (Paper No. 19 at 1), however, the orientation
of the diode determines whether the diode appears to be an
open circuit or a short circuit in the presence of a high
voltage. Claim 4 does not specify a direction in which the
opening structure must be open, nor does it exclude an
internal short—circuiting bus to which static discharge may be
shunted as in Ukai.

Appellant belatedly refers to claim l3 on rehearing
(Paper No. l9 at 2). Claim l3 was not separately argued in
the original appeal nor is its use now consistent with
Appellant's election to have the claims stand or fall
together. The limitations of claim 13 cannot be read into the
other claims. In any case, Appellant does not explain how the
limitations of claim 13 are inconsistent with our construction
of claim 4. Nothing in claim 13 excludes diodes, requires a

fuse, or specifies any direction of conductance.




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603
Application No. 08/243,839

Fundamentally, we disagree with Appellant's construction
of his claim. Appellant urges that

the use of a diode that conducts in a given

direction neither teaches nor suggests the use of a

fuse that will conduct in neither direction upon the

occurrence of an overcurrent condition but that will

conduct in either direction prior to such an event.
(Paper No. l9 at 2.) Assuming, arguendo, the truth of that

statement, it does not represent the entire scope of the

subject matter that Appellant has claimed.

determinations) we affirmed the examiner's rejection of claims

the present application in place of Judge Lazarus, who has

l, 3 and 6 through 10 under 35 U.S.C. § lO2(b) as being

anticipated by Noiles (U.S. Patent No. 4,978,356).

We have carefully reviewed the points of argument raised
by appellant in the request, however, we note that instead of
directing the request for rehearing to points which were
misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the decision on
appeal as is mandated by 37 CFR § l.l97(b), appellant has
essentially made new grounds of argument (regarding dependent
claim 8) which were not previously presented in the brief on

appeal.

While appellant recognizes that no separate argument was
presented in the brief (Paper No. 11) or in the reply brief
(Paper No. 13) concerning the examiner's rejection of
dependent claim 8 under 35 U.S.C. § lO2(b) as being
anticipated by Noiles, appellant now urges that claim 8
deserves substantive consideration and characterizes this
Board's determination that dependent claims 7 and 8

(particularly claim 8) should fall with independent parent




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2000-0451
Application No. 08/726,088

claim 6 as being "a specious basis for upholding an otherwise

defective rejection" (request, page 2).

37 CFR §§ l.l92(c)(7) and l.l92(c)(8)(iii) clearly place
the burden on appellant to state in the brief that the claims
of a given group subject to a particular ground of rejection
"do not stand or fall together" and also to present arguments
for the separate patentability of each of the claims to be
contested, and, with regard to a rejection based on 35 U.S.C.
§ l02, requires appellant to specify the error in the
rejection and to set forth why a particular claim or group of
claims is patentable, including any specific limitations in
the rejected claim or claims which are not present in the
prior art relied upon in the rejection. If, as in the present
case, appellant has not complied with the above dictates of 37
CFR § l.l92, then the regulation provides that the Board
"shall select a single claim from the group and shall decide
the appeal as to the ground of rejection on the basis of that
claim alone." As was made clear in the paragraph bridging
pages l2 and l3 of our decision mailed March 29, 2001, this is

essentially what transpired with regard to appellant's

Appellant's attempt to belatedly present new arguments
directed to the examiner's rejection of claim 8 under 35
U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Noiles is unavailing,
since a new argument advanced in a request for rehearing, but
not advanced in appellant's brief, is not properly before the
Board and will not be considered. See Ex_pa;;g_Hindg;§inn,

177 USPQ 78, 80 (Bd. App. 1971) and Ex_pa;;g_Ha;ygy, 163 USPQ

572, 573 (Bd. App. 1968) (Question not presented to Board in

appeal and not discussed by examiner is not appropriate for

decision by Board on petition for reconsideration). Note also

1986) and  ,

154 F.3d 1321, 1331, 47 USPQ2d 1896, 1904 (Fed. Cir. 1998)
wherein the Court noted that a party cannot wait until after
the Board has rendered an adverse decision and then present

new arguments in a request for reconsideration.

Regarding appellant's assertion (request, page 2) that
the limitation in claim 8 "is the same limitation on which the
Board patentably distinguished claim 4 from Moch," we suggest

that appellant might wish to read claims 4 and 8 again, since

5




*** PAGE 6 ***

the limitations in these two claims are clearly not the same.
The limitations of claim 4 are much more precise as to the
curvature of the superior neck of the femoral stem and the

planes involved, than the broader recitation in claim 8.

In light of the foregoing, appellant's request is granted
to the extent of reconsidering our decision, but is denied

with respect to making any changes therein.

This is a decision on the Request for Rehearing, filed Aug. 15, 2002, from our
decision affirming-in-part the examiner's final rejection of claims 1-28 under 35 U.S.C.
§§ 102 and 103.

We have carefully considered appellant's arguments in the request, however, we
are not persuaded that our decision on the record before us was in error. Appellant
argues at page 7 of the Request for Rehearing that the conclusion paragraph does not

agree with the text of the decision. We agree with appellant that the conclusion




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2000-0930
Application No. 08/888,339

paragraph erroneously indicated claims 25 and 27 as being reversed, but it was clear
from the text of the decision at page 6 that we sustained the examinefs rejection based
upon our finding of an aperture stop in Vogeley.
BACKGROUND

The appellant's invention relates to a catadioptric lens system for a scanning
device. An understanding of the invention can be derived from a reading of exemplary
claim 1, which is reproduced below.
1. An optical assembly for a photoelectric imaging apparatus in which a light path
extends between an object which is to be imaged and a photosensor array, said optical
assembly comprising:

said photosensor array;

at least one optical component arranged along said light path;

said at least one optical component including a lens; and

wherein said lens comprises a catadioptric lens.

The prior art reference of record relied upon by the examiner in rejecting the
appealed claims is:
Vogeley 4,003,642 Jan.18, 1977

Claims 1-4 and 12-16 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being anticipated
by Vogeley. Claims 5-11 and 17-28 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being

unpatentable over Vogeley.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2000-0930
Application No. 08/888,339

In the decision, we affirmed the decision of the examiner to reject claims 1-3 and
12-15 under 35 U.S.C. § 102; we reversed the decision of the examiner to reject claims
4 and 16 under 35 U.S.C. § 102; we affirmed the decision of the examiner to reject
claims 25 and 27 under 35 U.S.C. § 103, and we reversed the decision of the examiner
to reject claims 5-11 and 17-24, 26 and 28 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

With this said, appellant argues that we misapprehended the scope of
appellant's claims, and the independent claims 1 and 12 “require two-dimensional
imaging." (See Request for Rehearing at page 3.) Appellant argues that In re Sneed,
710 F.2d 1544, 1548, 218 USPQ 385, 388 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and In re Bond, 910 F.2d
831, 833, 15 USPQ2d 1566, 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1990) provide guidance as to interpreting
the claims in light of appellant’s speciﬁtion. We agree with appellant that claims must
be interpreted in light of the disclosed invention, but we are not willing to extend the
interpretation of elements and limitations that are neither impliedly set forth in the
language of the claim nor expressly recited in the disclosed invention. Appellant has
not identified what specific language in the claims is to be interpreted to limit the
claimed invention to two dimensional imaging. While appellant cites to various
occurrences in the specification of a “scanning device” (Request for Rehearing at pages
4-7), we do not agree that these disclosures change the scope of the claimed invention.
Appellant argues that we found that Vogeley discloses only a one dimensional image,

but that "scanning" involves two dimensional images. (See Request for Rehearing at




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2000-0930
Application No. 08/888,339

page 6.) We disagree with appellant. Rather, we found that Vogeley teaches two
dimensional imaging within the optics and the two dimensional image is compressed
into a one dimensional image by the optics. (Decision at page 3.)

We are not persuaded that we erred in our interpretation of the language of
independent claims 1 and 12. Appellant has the burden of identifying a clear error
(points misapprehended or overlooked) in the decision. (See 37 CFR § 1.197(b).) We
find that appellant has not identified any points misapprehended or overlooked in the
decision. Therefore, we decline to modify our decision beyond clariﬁcation of the
correct status of dependent claims 25 and 27.

CONCLUSION

In light of the foregoing, the appellant's request for rehearing is granted to the

extent of reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to making any change

thereto.

Judges.

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

The appellants request reconsideration of our October 19,
2001 decision wherein we affirmed the rejection of claims 6-8
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over the admitted prior art in view of
Aindow.

It remains undisputed that it would have been obvious to one
of ordinary skill in the art to apply Aindow’s powder removal air

jet (col. 7, lines 35-39) to the admitted prior art paste—point




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1060
Application No. 09/030,378

coating and scattering device (specification, page 1). The

appellants argue in their request for rehearing that if one did

so, that person would




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1060
Application No. 09/030,378

use only a small air jet angle as shown in Aindow’s figure 5
(item 152), and would not use an angle of 30—80° as recited in
the appellants’ claim 6.

Specifically, the appellants argue that the fact that
Aindow’s rollers are round rather than elliptical indicates that
Aindow’s drawings are at least roughly proportional, horizontal-
to—vertical (request, page 3).1 Round circles, however, are what
are drawn using a draftsman’s compass or template. The fact that
the circles are round does not mean that the components of the
apparatus, the distances between components, or the angle of the
air jet with respect to the web surface, are drawn to scale.
Aindow does not disclose the air jet angle in the specification,
and “[a]bsent any written description in the specification of
quantitative values, arguments based on measurement of a drawing
are of little value.” In re Wright, 569 F.2d 1124, 1127, 193

USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977). In Wright, wherein a reference did

not disclose that the drawings are to scale, the court rejected

the solicitor’s argument that the reference pointed to a distance

1 The appellants also argue generally that most drawings
are at least roughly proportional, horizontal—to—vertical
(reply, page 3), but provide no support for this argument.

from a groove to the rim of a whiskey barrel of about % inch to

1 inch. See id.
Also relevant are In re Nash, 230 F.2d 428, 109 USPQ 36

(CCPA 1956) and In re Olsen, 212, F.2d 590, 101 USPQ 402-03 (CCPA
1954). In Nash, 230 F.2d at 430-31, 109 USPQ at 37-38, the

specification described one of two openings in a load supporting
pneumatic cushioning device as being in free open communication
with a reservoir, and the other opening as being a restriction,
but the drawing showed the two openings as having substantially
the same diameter. The court stated that “[w]hile the
appellant's drawing, as above noted, seems to show the passages
as being of about the same size, it is well settled that the
drawings of patent applications are not necessarily scale or
working drawings, and that a clear disclosure of parts or
proportions in the specification is not nullified by a
draftsman’s error indicating different proportions or

arrangements.” Nash, 230 F.2d at 431, 109 USPQ at 38. In Olsen,

212 F.2d 590, 592-93, 101 USPQ 401, 402-03 (CCPA 1954), the court
stated that “[o]rdinarily drawings which accompany an application

for a patent are merely illustrative of the principles embodied




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1060
Application No. 09/030,378

in the alleged invention claimed therein and do not define the
precise proportions of elements relied upon to endow the claims
with patentability," and held that the drawings did not

adequately support an amendment to the specification which

recited




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1060
Application No. 09/030,378

that ball stop head portions of a coupler for releasably
connecting hydraulic fluid conduits are equally spaced with
respect to their associated valve seats.

Thus, Wright, Nash and Olsen all indicate that unless patent

drawings are disclosed as being drawn to scale, which Aindow’s
drawings are not, meaningful measurements cannot be taken from

them.

The appellants argue that the present case is more similar

to In re Heinrich, 268 F.2d 753, 122 USPQ 388 (CCPA 1959) than to

any of the above cases (request, page 3). The court in Heinrich,

268 F.2d at 755-56, 122 USPQ at 390, stated:

Each of the appealed claims calls for a taper of less
than 75° as projected against a plane parallel to the
axis of the sealing ring. Weis does not specify the
angle of taper but the board stated that the taper
shown in his drawing is less than 75° and that
statement is not questioned here by appellant. While
it is true that patent drawings are not ordinarily
considered to be working drawings drawn to scale, the
only reasonable interpretation of the Weis disclosure
is that a very small angle of taper is to be used and
we are of the opinion that one skilled in the art would
normally use a taper of less than 75° in carrying out
the teachings of the Weis patent, and that such an
angle is, therefore, fairly disclosed by the patent.

The appellants argue that “[h]ad Heinrich claimed a taper angle

of, say, ‘more than 30°’ surely the decision would have come out




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1060
Application No. 09/030,378

different" (request, page 3). That may be correct, considering
that the taper was that of a frusto—conical surface of a sealing
ring.

The present case, in contrast, involves the angle of a jet
for blowing powder off of a web and, unlike in Heinrich, it is
not reasonable to interpret Aindow as requiring a very small
angle of taper. Aindow's illustration of an air jet (figure 5,
item 152) and teaching that the air jet is for blowing powder off
of a web (col. 7, lines 35-39) in no way indicates that the angle
of the air jet to the web is to be limited to that illustrated.
The most reasonable interpretation of the reference is that any
angle which is effective for blowing off the powder is suitable.
As stated in our decision (page 6), one of ordinary skill in the
art, when applying Aindow's air jet to the admitted prior art
paste—point coating and scatter coating device (as, it is
undisputed, the applied prior art would have led such a person to
do), would have optimized the angle of the air jet and thereby
arrived at the steep angles recited in the appellants’ claims.

See In re Boesch, 617 F.2d 272, 276, 205 USPQ 215, 219 (CCPA

Application No. 09/059,865

ON BRIEF

Before SMITH, FLEMING, and GROSS, Administrative Patent Judges.

FLEMING, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has made two requests for rehearing, the first is
Paper No. 19 and the second is Paper No. 21. We will answer both
in this decision. In the first request, Appellant requests that
we reconsider our decision mailed on September 25, 2002, with
respect to affirming the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 18

through 23 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0336
Application No. 09/059,865

Appellant argues on pages 1 through 5 of the request that
the Board held that the term "stringer" means undesirable
residual non—dielectric material in accordance with the meaning
found in the specification and in accordance with the manner in
which the term is commonly understood by those of ordinary skill
in the art of semiconductor fabrication. Appellant points to
page 13, line 29 to page 14, line 2 of the specification which
describes stringers as being undesirable because they cause
problems, such as gate leakage for example. Appellant directs
the Board to page 22 of Plasma Processing Material; Scientific
Opportunities and Technological Challenges, Exhibit 1, which
describes "stringer" residue as being undesirable residual non-
dielectric material.

Upon our careful review of the specification and extrinsic
evidence now made of record, we agree with the Appellant that the
proper meaning of the claimed term "stringer" is an undesirable
residual non—dielectric material. We note that claim 12 requires
the limitation "removing a portion of the layer of non—dielectric
material, leaving stringers of the non—dielectric material in the
creases." We find that the scope of this limitation is removing
a portion of the layer of non—dielectric material, leaving an

undesirable residual non—dielectric material in the creases.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0336
Application No. 09/059,865

Claims 13 through 17 also recite this limitation due to their
dependence on claim 12.

As we have found on page 14 of our opinion, claim 18
includes the limitation of "removing a portion of the non-
dielectric material from the creases using a given method, the
given method leaving undesirable residual non—dielectric material
in some of the creases. Claims 19 through 23 also recite this
limitation due to their dependence on claim 18.

Appellant argues that Kim's silicon spacer is not an
undesirable residual non—dielectric material as required by
Appellant's claims. Appellant points out that in Kim's first
embodiment of Figure 1, the silicon spacer 18 is actually present
in the final device and used to fill part of the contact hole.
Appellant points out that even in Kim's second embodiment of
Figure 2, if it were not for the silicon spacer 18, the thermal
oxide spacer 19 could not be formed. Appellant argues in both
embodiments, the silicon spacer 18 is purposely created, useful,
desirable, and necessary for successful implementation of the Kim
device. see page 7 of the request.

We agree that Kim's spacer 18 cannot read on Appellant's

claimed undesirable residual non—dielectric material. Therefore,




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0336
Application No. 09/059,865

we reverse the rejection of claims 12 through 23 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103.

Appellant filed a second request for rehearing which
presents a Terminal Disclaimer, not before us at the time of our
decision. The second rehearing requests that we reconsider our
decision of the rejection under obviousness—type double patenting
in light of this Terminal Disclaimer. We will not reconsider our
decision because the Board will only consider a single request
for rehearing and the Board will only consider matters that the
Board misapprehended or overlooked in rendering our decision as
per 37 CFR § l.l97(b). The newly presented Terminal Disclaimer
was not before us when we rendered our decision and it would be
improper for us to consider it now.

Appellant's first request for rehearing is granted and the

second request is denied.

Appeal No. 2001-1381
Application 08/826,741

Patent No. 2,345,072 to Rosenleaf et al. (Rosenleaf) in view

of U.S. Patent No. 5,207,138 to Sato et al. (Sato)?

At issue is whether the combined teachings of Rosenleaf
and Sato would have suggested a machine meeting the
limitations in claims 1 and 26 requiring a base roll for
supporting the conveyed web during passage through the
perforating or severing station. In the decision, we
concluded that they would “because the web passing through
Rosenleaf’s machine is necessarily supported by the lower
rotor [base roll] 16 via one of its knives 17-20 during the
perforating or severing operation . . . . In this regard,
the limitations at issue do not require direct contact between
the base roll and the conveyed web” (page 8). Essentially
repeating arguments earlier made in their briefs, the
appellants dispute that the web passing though the Rosenleaf
machine is so supported by rotor 16. According to the

appellants,

1 In the decision, we also sustained the examiner's 35

U.S.C. § 103(a) rejection of dependent claims 3, 9 through 11,
13, 28 and 31 through 34 as being unpatentable over Rosenleaf
in view of Sato.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2001-1381
Application 08/826,741

[t]he knives easily slice through [Rosenleaf’s]
plaster board [web] without giving any support to
the plaster board.

As noted in Appellant's [sic] Reply Brief at
page 2, if a knife 17-20 on the rotor 16 of
Rosenleaf cuts or perforates the plaster board, it
cannot be said that the knife also supports the
plaster board. The terms “cutting” and
“perforating” each means that there is a relative
[vertical] movement between the knife and the
plaster board. The term “support” means that there
is no relative [vertical] movement between the knife
and the plaster board.

As soon as a knife 17-20 of Rosenleaf contacts
the web of plaster board, the cutting edge of the
knife (shown serrated in Fig 1) cuts into the
plaster board. As such, the knife and particularly
the serrated knife edge cannot support the web
[request, page 4].

Before addressing the substance of this argument, we f
it necessary to remark on the following passage in the
appellants’ request:

[i]t appears that the decision has not agreed
with the Examiner's reasons for rejecting claims 1
and 26 as being unpatentable over Rosenleaf in view
of Sato. That is to say, the BPAI agrees that it
would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
in the art to eliminate the cradle frame 112 of
Rosenleaf and to provide the Rosenleaf device with a
base roll moving means for moving the base roll
vertically out of position with the upper perforator
roll during a non—cutting phase in order to insure
that there is no interference between the lower base
roll and the web. Instead, the decision appears to
hold that Rosenleaf alone teaches that the plaster
board is supported by the rotor 16 during a
perforating or cutting operation, i.e. when the




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2001-1381
Application O8/826,741

cradle frame 112 is lowered out of the orbit of the

knives 17-20. This was not the issue of the Final

Rejection [page 3].

The foregoing takes great liberties with what we actually
stated. As pointed out on page 6 in the decision, the
appellants did not challenge the propriety of the proposed
combination of Rosenleaf and Sato. Hence, we found it
unnecessary to comment on same, and did not in fact do so. As
indicated above, the issue on appeal with respect to claims 1
and 26 was, and is, whether the combined teachings of
Rosenleaf and Sato respond to the base roll web—supporting
limitations in these claims. Given Rosenleaf’s status as the
primary reference in the proposed combination and the
character of the unchallenged modifications
advanced by the examiner in view of Sato, this question boils
down to whether Rosenleaf’s rotor 16 meets the subject
limitations. The examiner's position that rotor 16 does meet
these limitations appears in both the final rejection and
answer (Paper Nos. 17 and 20).

As for the merits of the examiner's determination, we

remain of the view that “the web passing through Rosenleaf’s

machine is necessarily supported by the lower rotor 16 via one




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 2001-1381
Application O8/826,741

of its knives 17-20 during the perforating or severing
operation" (decision, page 8). Even if the appellants’ bald
assertion that Rosenleaf’s knives easily slice through the
plaster board web is taken at face value, it simply does not
follow that the knives fail to provide at least some support
to the web. The nature of plaster board and the engagement of
the knives with the bottom thereof provide reasonable factual
support for concluding that the knives, and hence the rotor or
roller 16 mounting the knives, support the web however
fleetingly. Contrary to the appellants’ contention, there is
nothing in claims 1 and 26 or in the ordinary and accustomed
meaning of the term “support” which excludes the relative
vertical movement between Rosenleaf’s knives and the web which
admittedly occurs during the perforating or severing
operation. Simply put, this argument, and the

appellants’ position as a whole that Rosenleaf’s rotor 16 does
not respond to the web supporting limitations in claims 1 and
26, rest on an improper attempt to read limitations from the

specification into these claims.

MCQUADE, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQQEST FQR REHEARINQ

Pursuant to 37 CFR § l.197(b), R. Lee Roberts et al. request
rehearing of our decision on appeal rendered January 27, 2003
(Paper No. 27). The appellants have limited the request to that
part of the decision under the heading “IV. Additional matter for
consideration” wherein we stated:

[u]pon return of the application to the technology
center, the examiner should consider whether the

extruded multi-block sections or lengths disclosed by

Roberts and Berkebile, considered in conjunction with

the conventional 4 foot individual block length taught
by Brown ‘388 and admitted to be prior art [by]




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2002-1430
Application 08/935,365

the appellants (see pages 3 and 8 in the appellants’

specification) would have suggested a multi-block

section or length meeting the limitations in claims 6,

7 and 18, thereby warranting an appropriate § 103(a)

rejection of these claims [page 13].

On rehearing, the appellants raise two matters for
reconsideration. First, the appellants believe that the
reference to claim 18 instead of claim 28 was a typographical
error and seek correction thereof. Second, the appellants
“request that section IV of the Decision on Appeal be stricken in
its entirety” (request, page 3) as being unwarranted and
inconsistent with principles of res judicata because it instructs
the examiner to entertain “the precise issue considered by this
Board in section III of the Decision on Appeal” (request, page
2).

The appellants’ first point is well taken, but their second
is not.

Read in context, the reference in section IV of the decision
to claims 6, 7 and 18 clearly should have been to claims 6, 7 and
28. As surmised by the appellants, this mistake stemmed from a
typographical error.

As for its substantive content, section IV of the decision

merely proposed that the examiner consider whether the combined

teachings of Roberts, Berkebile and Brown ‘388 would have




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2002-1430
Application 08/935,365

suggested a multi—block section or length meeting the limitations
in claims 6, 7 and 18 [sic, 28], thereby leading to an
appropriate § 103(a) rejection of these claims. Although the
same references were employed by the examiner to reject claims 6,
7 and 28 under § 103(a), they were applied in a different manner
to conclude that it would have been obvious in view of Roberts or
Berkebile to modify the length of the underdrain block disclosed
by Brown ‘388 in order to form longer blocks necessary to support
longer filter media beds of liquid filtration systems. Finding
nothing in the disclosures by Roberts and Berkebile of extruded
multi—block sections or lengths intended to be cut into
individual blocks which would have suggested providing the
individual block disclosed by Brown ‘388 with a longitudinal
length any longer than its disclosed about 4 foot length, we
declined to sustain the rejection (see section III, pages 10 and
11 in the decision). In doing so, we found the Roberts,
Berkebile and Brown ‘388 references to be wanting only as to the
particular manner in which they were combined by the examiner to
support the rejection. Our suggestion that the examiner
reconsider the patentability of claims 6, 7 and 28 involves a
different application of these references, and consequently a

different issue. Accordingly, it does not run afoul of any

principles of res judicata, even if it is assumed that such
principles are relevant to these circumstances.

In light of the foregoing, section IV will not be stricken
from our decision, but it is modified to the extent that the
reference therein to “claims 6, 7 and 18” should be read as
——claims 6, 7 and 28——. Hence, the appellants’ request for

rehearing is granted—in—part.

ON BRIEF

Before COHEN, FRANKFORT, and NASE, Administrative Patent Judges.
NASE, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to the appellant's request for rehearing‘ of our decision mailed

July 31, 2002, wherein we affirmed the examiner's rejection of claim 3 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103 as being unpatentable over the acknowledged prior art set forth on pages 1, 2 and 6

of the specification (hereafter, APA) in view of Wierz.

 

‘ Filed August 12, 2002.

2 Wier, Adventure Travel Photography, 26 (New York, Watson-Guptill Publications, 1992).




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2002-1809 Page 2
Application No. 09/798,050

The argument (p. 2) raised by the appellant is that this panel of the Board of Patent
Appeals and interferences overlooked the fact that
the Wier prior art was withdrawn and deemed in the EXAMlNER'S ANSWER at

page 5 in the last paragraph as "art rejections of non-final Office Action of June 26,
2001 [that] are no longer applied to the appealed claim."

We have carefully considered the argument raised by the appellant in the request
for rehearing, however, the argument therein does not persuade us that our decision was
in error in any respect. In fact, the argument does not set forth any error in our
detennination that claim 3 was unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over the combined

teachings of APA and Wier.

We do not agree with the appellant's apparent argument that Wier was withdrawn
as prior art being applied against claim 3 for the following reasons: (1) Weir was cited and
applied against claim 3 in the final rejection (Paper No. 5, mailed October 9, 2001);

(2) Weir was cited and applied against claim 3 in the examiner's answer (Paper No. 8,
mailed March 21, 2002); and (3) on page 2 of the answer, the examiner stated that "[t]he
appellant's statement of the issues in the brief is correct" and the sole issue set forth on
page 3 of the appellant's brief (Paper No. 6, filed January 18, 2002) was whether claim 3
on appeal is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over the APA in view of Wier. While the

examiner did state on page 5 of the answer that "[i]n response to arguments of lines 17




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2002-1809 Page 3
Application No. 09/798,050

and 18 of page 6, the art rejections of non-final Office Action of June 26, 2001 are no
longer applied to the appealed claim," we cannot speculate as to what the examiner
meant. However, it is clear to us that the examiner did not mean by that statement to
withdraw Wier as a reference being applied in the final rejection of claim 3 that was being

appealed.

In light of the foregoing, the appellant's request for rehearing is granted to the
extent of reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to making any change

thereto.

ON BRIEF

Before PAK, OWENS, and DELMENDO, Administrative Patent Judges.

DELMENDO, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REHEARING
This is in response to the appellant's request for

rehearing (request) pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.197(b)
(2003)(effective Dec. 1, 1997), filed on Jul. 15, 2004 (paper
15), of our Jun. 28, 2004 decision (paper 14). In our original
decision, we affirmed the examiner's rejection under 35 U.S.C. §
103(a) (2003) of appealed claims 27 and 30 as unpatentable over
U.S. Patent No. 4,150,851 issued to Cienfuegos on Apr. 24, 1979.

(Original decision, pages 3—9J




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2004-1408
Application No. 10/166,590

Because we do not find any of the appellant's arguments to
be persuasive, we decline to modify our original decision in any
respect.

The appellant argues that Cienfuegos does not provide any
motivation to form the claimed adjustable support and in fact
teaches away from it. (Request at 2.) Specifically, the
appellant alleges (;g.):

The structural requirements logically imposed by
the reference to form a device adjustable to hold a
seat at a plurality of closely spaced apart elevations
to accommodate a plurality of users having different
sizes is in direct conflict with the required large
distance (“greater than about 2 inches”) between first
and second adjacent holdable positions. The reference
teaches away from the claimed widely spaced apart
holdable positions by suggesting a mechanism operable
to hold a seat at a plurality of closely spaced apart
positions to fit all of a plurality of users having a
variety of sizes. In conflict with MPEP 2143.01, the
asserted modification renders the prior art
unsatisfactory for its intended purpose.

We do not agree. While Cienfuegos teaches that an
“exercycle in a gymnasium is used by large numbers of different
people during the course of the day” (column 3, lines 1-3),
nothing in the reference indicates that the disclosed adjustable
support must necessarily accommodate “all of a plurality of
users having a variety of sizes." That is, nothing in

Cienfuegos indicates to one of ordinary skill in the art that a




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2004-1408

Application No. 10/166,590

support that is incrementally adjustable in height by greater
than about 2 inches would be unusable. In re Gurley, 27 F.3d
551, 553, 31 UsPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

To the contrary, Cienfuegos would have suggested to one of
ordinary skill in the art that a support having several
adjustable height positions at, e.g., about 2-inch increments
would be suitable for use as part of a home exercycle or
bicycle. Although the same adjustable support might not
comfortably accommodate the entire world population, it would
nevertheless be useful for a significant portion of the general
population. In the case of a child's bicycle, such increments
would facilitate periodic height adjustments commensurate with
the natural growth of the child. Here, one of ordinary skill in
the art would have recognized from the teachings of the prior
art that the number of possible height positions and the
distance be:ween the positions of adjacent heights would
necessarily affect the cost of manufacturing the device. For a
given overall length of adjustable support, the total number of
drilled holes increases as the distance between the adjacent

height posi:ions is decreased. Thus, one of ordinary skill in

the art would have balanced the desirability of accommodating




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2004-1408

Application No. 10/166,590

the entire population against the cost of manufacturing the
device.

The appellant urges that if the first and second holdable
positions were spaced at greater than 2 inches in the support of
Cienfuegos, a person with an intermediate height “unavoidably
would be precluded from supporting the seat at his desired
ergonomic elevation..." (Request at 3.) We are not persuaded,
because the appellant has failed to identify any objective
evidence in the record establishing that a person of such
intermediate height would be inconvenienced to any significant
degree, much less unable to use the exercycle or bicycle.

The appellant alleges that the recited distance between the
first and second holdable positions “is outside a known, or even
reasonably suggested, range." (Request at 3.) Again, however,
the appellant has utterly failed to establish that the recited
distance would result in a support that is unusable for any of
the purposes disclosed or suggested in Cienfuegos.

The appellant contends that “more precise adjustment
obtained from a smaller spacing was admitted by the Examiner at
page 2 of paper No. 5, which constitutes evidence in the record
to substantiate criticality for a size of a spacing between

holdable positions." (Request at 4.) This position lacks




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 2004-1408

Application No. 10/166,590

merit. In the final Office action mailed May 1, 2003 (paper 5),
the examiner merely repeated a finding of fact made in the
Office action mailed Feb. 4, 2003 (paper 3). This finding of
fact, which the appellant does not dispute, does not constitute
evidence substantiating “criticality,” much less unexpected
criticality. Rather, it constitutes evidence of ohviousness.

The appellant's request is granted to the extent of

reconsidering our original decision but is denied with respect

to making any substantive changes thereto.

HEARD: February 9, 2000

Before PAK, WARREN and WALTZ, Administrative Patent Judges.

WARREN, Administrative Patent Judge.
On Request F or Rehearing

Appellants request rehearing under 37 CFR § 1.197(b) (1997) of our decision dated February
29, 2000 (Paper No. 27) aﬂirrning the examiner’s rejection of appealed claims 1 through 20 under 35
U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over Gamble in view of Morgan. Appellants contend (1) that our
opinion includes new grounds of rejection of (a) claims 5 and 6, because the examiner “did not rely on
‘admitted prior art’ to rejec ” these claims, and (b) of claim 18, because the examiner “did not rely on
‘overlapping subject matter’ to reject” this claim, that were not designated as such under 37 CFR §
1.196(b) (1997); and (2) that we must reverse the gound of rejection of record because we gave “the
claimed phrase ‘in a resin’ . . . an unreasonable interpretation” in our opinion (request, page 1).




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 96—3533
Application 08/203,624

Appellants submit, with respect to their ﬁrst contention, that the “Courts have recognized
Appellants’ right to respond to new grounds of rejection advanced for the ﬁrst time in a decision on
appeal” (id., page 2). We agree with appellants that this is the case if a new grormd of rejection was in
fact made in a decision on appeal. Indeed, the issue presented here is whether our opinion in support of
our affrrrrrance of claims 5 and 6 and of claim 18 included a new ground of rejection of these two
groups of claims. With respect to whether a new ground of rejection was in fact made in a decision on
appeal, the predecessor court to our reviewing court set forth the general proposition that “the ultimate
criterion of whether a rejection is considered ‘new’ in a decision by the board is whether appellants
have had fair opportunity to react to the thrust of the rejection.” In re Kronig, 539 F.2d 13(1), 1302-
03, 190 USPQ 425, 426-427 (CCPA 1976) (“In affirming, the board used the same basis, but without
disagreeing with the examiner’ s approach, limited its discussion to the evidence contained” in three of
the four cited references, relying thereon for the same evidence used by the examiner, such that
“[h]aving compared the rationale of the rejection advanced by the examiner and the board on this
record, we are convinced that the basic thrust of the rejection at the examiner and the board level was
the same.”); see also In re Boon, 439 F.2d 724, 727-28, 169 USPQ 231, 234 (CCPA 1971) (Even
though the board’s opinion included “ampliﬁed reasons” in support of the aflirrnance of the exarr1iner’s
rejection that were based on “additional facts, not previously in the record, of which the board took
notice[,] . . . we are satisﬁed from our review of the record that, even when such facts are included, the
‘evidentiary scheme’ supporting the board’s position on this rejection does not differ in substance from
that of the examiner,” as “the fact so noticed plays a minor role, serving only ‘to ﬁll in the gaps’ which
might exist in the evidentiary showing made by the examiner . . . . [In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 165
USPQ 418 ([CCPA] 1970)]. Under such circumstances, as we held in Ahlert, an applicant must be
given the opportunity to challenge either the correctness of the fact asserted or the notoriety or repute of
the reference cited in support of the assertion,” which challenge must “contain adequate information or
argument so that on its face it creates a reasonable doubt regarding the circumstances justifying the
judicial notice.”).

With respect to claims 5 and 6, appellants submit that our reliance on admitted prior art set forth
in appellants’ speciﬁcation in affirming the examiner’s ground of rejection constituted “a different

-2-




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application O8/203,624

rationale and different evidence” than advanced by the examiner in tl1e answer because the examiner
relied “only on Gamble combined with Morgan throughout the prosecution “without any menti of any
alleged prior an admissions” (request, pages 3-5). While we agree that the examiner did not rely on
admitted prior art in the ground of rejection, we cannot agree that appellants’ analysis adequately
reﬂects the record.

Appealed claim 5 modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1, wherein the applying step comprises
spraying the coating material on the substrate” while claim 6 modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1, wherein
the applying step is carried out with an air nozzle spray gun.” In explaining the ground of rejection in the
answer (pages 4-5), the examiner stated that “Morgan teaches that resinlﬁber mixtures used as EMI
shields can be applied by spraying” in taking the position that one of ordinary skill in this art would have
reasonably expected “that the resin(ﬁber mixture of Gamble could be successfully applied by
spraying based on the combined teachings of Gamble and Morgan” (emphasis supplied). In
response to appellants’ arguments in their principal brief speciﬁcally directed to claims 5 and 6, i.e.,
‘Morgan fails to provide the necessary incentive or motivation to modify Gamble in a manner which
would result in a coating applied to a substrate nmch less applying the coating by spraying,” (page 14),
the examiner stated (answer, page 9; emphasis supplied):

Claim 5 recites spraying. Morgan clearly teaches spraying.

Claimérecitesthatthe applying stepiscauiedoutusinganairnozzle spray gun. Morganis
silent regarding the type of spray gun to be used. Since Morgan is silent with respect to the
typeofsprayguntobeused,theslcilledartisanwouldhavetotumtothepriorarttoﬁnda
suitable spray gun to use. Air nozzle spray guns are conventional and commonplace in the
coating art and the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation that an air
nozzle spray gun would successfully function as the generic spray gun of Morgan.

In theirreply brief (page 9), appellants point out in argument with respect to claims 3 and 4 that
“the fact that Morgan fails to disclose how the spraying is performed cannot possibly be a disclosure of
pressurizing a container,” and state that “[t]he same reasoning applies to Claim 6 which recites that the
applying step is carried out with an air nozzle spray gun, a feature not taught or suggested by Morgan.”
The examiner stated in the supplemental answer (page 3), that the limitations of claim 6 “were




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

thoroughly addressed” in the section of the answer we set forth above. Appellants did not respond
ﬁrrther with respect to this matter in their supplemental reply brief
In considering claims 5 and 6, we stated in our original opinion (pages 10- 11):

With respect to claims 5 and 6, we ﬁnd that appellants admit that coating material
compositions comprising at least ﬁbers contained in a resin matrix were known in the art to
be applied to a substrate by “spraying” with an “air nozzle spray gun” in disclosing that

standard top—feed pressure—pot spray systems with either extemal— or intemal—mix
needle valve spray guns have been found to promote ﬁber clumping and breakage
since they do not provide a smooth, Imrestricted passage for the ﬁber containing
matrix. [Page 4, lines 7- 10; emphasis supplied.]

We point out with respect to this disclosure that there is no limitation in the appealed claims
which speciﬁes the condition of the ﬁbers in the spray_nozzle during the spraying action (see
supra pp. 5- 6). Even if the claims contained such a limitation, the selection of solvents which
facilitate spraying of an El\/II coating composition that can contain conductive ﬁbers was
within the ordinary skill in the art as seen from the teachings of Morgan (e.g., col. 4, line 45,
col. 5, lines 26-42, col. 6, lines 7- 15 and 30-44).

Furthermore, in addition to appellants’ admission, we ﬁnd that Morgan would have
reasonably suggested to one of ordinary skill in this art that coating material compositions,
such as those taught in Gamble, can be applied to a substrate by spraying because Morgan
teaches that this method is one of a number of conventional coating techniques which can be
used with coating compositions containing ﬁbers and resin (e.g., col. 4, line 45, and col. 6,
lines 7- 11) and, as we found above, discloses that the solvent used in the compositions
should be selected accordingly. Indeed, Gamble does not limit the manner in which the
compositions disclosed therein can be applied to a substrate and further discloses that
“[v]arious chemical additives” can be added to these compositions “for their art-recognized
purposes” (col. 6, lines 35-40). Thus, the compositions of Gamble can contain the same
solvents as contained by the compositions of Morgan, which compositions would fall within
those used in the claimed methods of the appealed claims. Accordingly, one of ordinary skill
in this art following the combined teachings of Gamble and Morgan in light of the knowledge
in the art as admitted by appellants, prima facie, would have applied the compositions of
Gamble to a substrate using conventional spraying methods with the reasonable expectation
of forming a coating on the substrate. [Citations ornitted.]

In considering appellant’s arguments, we referred to the limitation “to a speciﬁc type of spray gun (claim
6, dependent on claim 1) (see reply brief, page 9)” (opinion, page 12).

On this record, it is apparent that the issue of whether the “applying step is canied out with an
air nozzle gun” is lirrrited to claim 6 as this limitation does not appear in claim 5. It is further apparent




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

from the record that issues raised by the examiner of whether “[a]ir nozzle spray guns are conventional
and commonplace in the coating art” and whether “the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable
expectation that an air noule spray gun would successfully ﬁmction as the generic spray gun of Morgan”
also were made with respect to claim 6 and were at least noticed by appellants in their reply brief with
respect to claim 6. Thus, these issues were placed squarely before appellants in the answer and in the
supplemental answer, providing appellants with the opportunity to respond to the examiner’s ﬁndings in
the answer in their reply brief and in their supplemental brief. Appellants did not challenge the
examiner’s ﬁndings in either of these briefs, not1'r1g only in the former that the lirrritation of claim 6 is “a
feature not taught or suggested by Morgan.” Because appellants did not take either opportunity to
challenge the exarr1iner’s notice that “[a]ir nozzle spray guns are conventional and commonplace in the
coating art,” we considered the examiner’s ﬁndings to be conclusive, although we did not expressly so
state in our opinion. See generally, In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 1091-92, 165 USPQ 418, 420-21
(CCPA 1970).

Following the lead of the examiner that “[a]ir nozzle spray guns are conventional and
commonplace in the coating art,” we pointed out in the section of our original opinion set forth above, to
the admission in appellants’ speciﬁcation that “coating material compositions comprising at least ﬁbers
contained in a resin matrix were known in the art to be applied to a substrate by ‘spraying’ with an ‘air

7”

nozzle spray gun. We then separately discussed the issue of whether ‘Morgan wo11ld have reasonably
suggested to one of ordinary skill in this art that coating material compositions, such as those taught in
Gamble, can be applied to a substrate by spraying,” and concluded on the combined teachings of
Gamble and Morgan, along with the admission as to claim 6, that ‘prima facie, would have applied the
compositions of Gamble to a substrate using conventional spraying methods with the reasonable
expectation of forming a coating on the substrate,” which did not emphasize the issue of the
conventionality 0 “air nozzle spray glms.”

Thus, while we recognized that appellants’ disclosure contained an aclmowledgermnt that “air
nozzle spray guns” were known in the art, as noticed by the examiner, it is apparent that the position
advanced by the examiner was indeed the basis for the ground of rejection on appeal with respect to
claims 5 and 6 and our afﬁrmance thereof with respect to these claims. Therefore, we did no more in

-5-




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

our opinion than further note the conventionality of “air nozzle spray guns” with the additional
particularity of pointing to the admission in appellants’ speciﬁcation.

Thus, upon reconsideration of our decision to affirm the examiner’s ground of rejection with
respect to claims 5 and 6 hr light of appellants’ arguments and authority advanced in their request, on
this record, we cannot discern that we have changed the thrust of the examiner’s ground of rejection, or,
ir1 other words, the evidentiary scheme that we have described in our opinion with the ampliﬁed
reasoning set forth therein based on facts of record does not differ ir1 substance from that set forth by
the examiner ir1 his answer. Indeed, it is apparent that appellants had ample “fair opportunity” to react
to the thrust or evidentiary scheme of the rejection with respect to claim 6 based on the examiner’s
notice of the conventionality of “air nozzle spray guns” even in View of our opinion. Kronig, supra; cf.
Boon, supra; In re Waymouth, 486 F.2d 1058, 1060-61,179 USPQ 627, 629 (CCPA 1973).

Accordingly, we decline to designate our afﬁrmance of the examiner’s rejection of claims 5 and
6 as a new ground of rejection under 37 CFR § 1.196(b) (1997).

With respect to claim 18, appellants submit that “it is clear [from the answer] that the Examiner
did not reject claim 18 on the basis of ‘overlapping subject matter’ between the claimed range and the
range disclosed in Gamble” and “it is clear [from the answer and supplemental answer] that the
Examiner considered the range set forth ir1 claim 18 to be different from, not overlapping, the range ir1
Gamble” while we stated ir1 our opinion that the teachings of Gamble “overlaps” the range speciﬁed in
this claim. Thus, appellants argue that ‘The Board adopted a different line of reasoning than the
Examiner in afﬁrming the rejection of claim 18 (request, pages 5-7). We cannot subscribe to
appellants’ position.

Claim 18 modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1, wherein the ﬁbers comprise less than 0.2% by
weight of the coating.” In the answer, the examiner, in considering claim 7, stated that “Gamble teaches
that the ﬁbers make up 1 to 45% of the coating” (page 9) and, found with respect to claim 18 that “[i]t
would have been obvious to the skilled artisan, in the absence of a showing of criticality, to have
determined the optimum amount of ﬁbers to be added to the resin through routine experimentation”
(pages 10-11). After urging the separate patentability of claim 18 solely on the basis that “the ﬁbers
comprise less than 0.2% by weight of the coating” hr the principal brief (pages 14- 15), appellants argue

-5-




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

in their reply brief that “Gamble prefers 2 to 20%” and thus “teaches away from the claimed invention
since the unpreferred 1% lower limit of Gamble’s ﬁbers is still 500% greater than the upper limit recited
in claim 18” (page 10). The examiner points out in the supplemental answer that ‘The actual difference
between the two values is 0.8 wt % and this small difference is considered to be an obvious
modiﬁcation of [Gamble] in the absence of a showing of criticalityf’ (page 4). In their supplemental reply
brief, under the heading “Absence of overlapping subject matter negates Examiner’s requirement for
‘showing of criticality”’ (page 1), appellants argue that “[t]he Examiner has provided absolutely no
reasoning to support the assertion that it would have been obvious to lower the lower limit of the ﬁber
content in the composite of Gamble to within the range set forth in Claim 18” and thus “has failed to
establish a prima facie case of obviousness with respect to” this claim (page 5).
hr considering claim 18, we stated in our original opinion (pages 14- 15; italic emphasis in

original; underline emphasis supplied):

As we set forth above (see supra p. 11), Gamble would have taught one of ordinary skill in
this art that the selection of these materials is based on the desired EMI characteristics of the
shield to be prepared. We are not persuaded otherwise by the limitations with respect to the
amount of ﬁber which is speciﬁed in unrelated dependent claims 7[1] and 18. In this respect,
we fail to ﬁnd any teaching in Gamble which would place a lower limit on the amount of
ﬁbers, conductive (claims 7 and 18) and non—conductive (claim 18), that can be dispersed in
the resin matrix. Indeed, Gamble discloses that the conductive ﬁber, such as those speciﬁed
ir1 claim 7 (col. 4, line 30, and col. 4, line 30, to col. 5, line 5), “advantageously comprises . .
. about 1 . . . percent by weight of the ElVlI shield” (col. 5, lines 9-11; emphasis supplied),
which disclosure in view of the term “abou ” would have been considered one of by ordinary
skill in this art to reasonably encompass ﬁber “in an amount less than 1 wt % of the coating”
as speciﬁed ir1 claim 7. We are ﬁnther of the opinion that this disclosure of Gamble along
with the ﬁrrther teaching that any amount of non—conductive ﬁber could be used (col. 6, lines
46-54), would also have suggested to one of ordinary skill in this art that an even smaller
amount of ﬁbers may be present, including a content of “less than 0.2% by weight of the
coating” as speciﬁed ir1 claim 18. Thus, we agree with the examiner that the range of the
percent by weight of ﬁber, conductive and non— conductive, which can be contained in the
compositions of the claims, overlaps with the range of such ﬁbers in Gamble. Indeed, in

1 We observe that claim 7, which was not include hr the request, modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1,
wherein . . . the ﬁbers comprising n1etal- coated dielectric or semiconductive ﬁbers ir1 an amount of less
than 1 wt % of the coating” and thus would encompass methods that utilize at least part of the types of
ﬁbers and the amount thereof as speciﬁed for methods encompassed by claim 18.

Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

View of the teaching in the reference that the amount of ﬁber employed depends on the
desired properties, the absence of a lower limit for the ﬁber in Gamble would have
reasonably suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art that the ﬁbers can be used in an
amount which encompasses the claimed ranges. Under these circumstances, the burden is
on appellants to demonstrate the criticality of the claimed ranges. In re Geixler, 116 F.3d
1465, 1470, 43 USPQ2d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1997); In re Waodruﬂ, 919 F.2d 1575,
1577-78, 16 USPQ2d 1934, 1936-37 (Fed. Cir. 1990); In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456,
105 USPQ 233, 235 (CCPA 1955).

We must agree with appellants that we incorrectly attributed to the examiner our ﬁnding that the
teachings of Gamble “overlaps” with the methods of claim 18. In addition to this characterization of the
teachings of Gamble vis-a-Vis the methods of clainr 18, we also expressed the opinion that “in view of
the teaching in the reference that the amount of ﬁber employed depends on the desired properties, the
absence of a lower limit for the ﬁber in Gamble wo11ld have reasonably suggested to one of ordinary
skill in the art that the ﬁbers can be used in an amount which encompasses the claimed ranges.” While
our ﬁndings present a more comprehensive review of the teachings of Gamble vis-a-vis the methods of
claim 18 than that presented by the examiner in stating that Gamble teaches that the ﬁbers can be
present in an amount of 1 wt %, we consider our ﬁnding that the teachings of “Gamble wo11ld have
reasonably suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art that the ﬁbers can be used in an amount which
encompasses the claimed ranges” to be essentially the same as the examiner’s ﬁndings that one of
ordinary skill in the art would “have determined the optimum amount of ﬁbers to be added to the resin
through routine experimentation” and that “the actual difference between [1 wt % and less than 0.2 wt
%] is 0.8 wt % and this small difference is considered to be an obvious modiﬁcation of [Gamble].” We
agreed with the examiner that the ﬁnding of primafacie obviousness of the amount of “ﬁbers
comprising less than 0.2% by weight of the coating” in claim 18 over the teachings of Gamble, which
does not disclose that amount per se, was such as to shift the burden to appellants to demonstrate the
criticality of the amount of ﬁbers speciﬁed in that claim.

On this record, it is apparent that our afﬁrrnance of the examiner’s ground of rejection with
respect to claim 18 was not based solely on the ﬁnding of an “overlap” between the amount of ﬁbers
according to the teachings of Gamble and the amount speciﬁed in claim 18. Indeed, we lmow of no

authority which holds that a primafacie case of obviousness is established only when there is an




*** PAGE 9 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application O8/203,624

“overlap” in the claimed and prior art ranges of a particular process parameter or ingredient. Rather, a
primafacie case of obviousness is dependent on whether one of ordinary skill in the art would have
reasonably expected that the proportion or range of the claimed invention encompassed by the
appealed claims would result in the same properties or achieve the same results as the proportion or
range of the applied prior art. See generally, Haynes Int'l, Inc. v. Jessop Steel Co., 8 F.3d 1573,
1577 n.3, 28 USPQ2d 1652, 1655 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (‘The Board’s position was consonant with
this court’s precedent holding that when the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is
the range or value of a particular variable, then a primafacie rejection is properly established when the
differencein range orvalueis minor. In re Woodruﬂ, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578, 16 USPQ2d 1934, 1936
(Fed. Cir. 1990); Titanium Metals Corp. of America v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775,783, 227 USPQ
773, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1985).”).

Thus, upon reconsideration of our decision to aﬂirm the exarniner’s ground of rejection with
respect to claim 18 in light of appellants’ argurmnts advanced in their requmt, on this record, we ﬁnd
that we cannot discern that we have changed the thrust of the exa.rniner’s grounds of rejection, or, in
other words, the evidentiary scherm that we have described in our opinion with the arrrpliﬁed reasoning
set forth therein based onfacts of record does not differ in substance from that set forth by the examiner
in the answer. Indeed, it is apparent that appellants had ample “fair opportunity” to react to the thrust or
evidentiary scheme of the rejection with respect to claim 18 based on the examiner’s ﬁnding that the
differences between the teachings of Gamble and the limitation of claim 18 was such as to require
appellants to establish the criticality of the claimed amount of ﬁbers even in view of our opinion.

Kronig, supra; cf. Boon, supra; In re Waymouth, supra.

Accordingly, rm: decline to designate our afﬁrrnance of the examirrer’s rejection of claim 18 as a
new ground of rejection under 37 CFR § l.l96(b) (1997).

Appellants’ second contention is that we must reverse the yound of rejection of record because
we gave “the claimed phrase ‘in a [sic, the] resin’ . . . an unreasonable intmpretation by reading the
claimed phrase on an aqueous suspension of ﬁbers and powder resin” in our opinion (request, pages 1
and 7- 10). The subject phrase appears in the ﬁrst and second speciﬁed steps of the claimed method
encompassed by claim 1 (emphasis supplied):




*** PAGE 10 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

1. A method of dispersing ﬁbers in an electromagnetic-attenuating coating and applying the
coating to a substrate, comprising steps of:

mixingacoatingmaterialctmrprisingﬁbers andresininacontainerby shakingthecontainer
such that the ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in the resin without breaking tl1e ﬁbers;

feeding the coating rmterial from the container while maintaining the ﬁbers uniformly
dispersed in the resin and withtmt breaking the ﬁbers; and

applying the coating material to the substrate.

According to appellants, we improperly read “the claimed phrase on an aqueous suspension of
ﬁbers and powder resins” and thus “on Garr1ble’s ‘papermaking’ process” shown in Gamble Example 1”
that involves “stirring a slurry of . . . aluminum coated glass ﬁbers and . . . high density polyethyle
powders in . . . water,” which “mixes ﬁbers in water, not in a resin, as claim ” (request, page 7).
Appellants contrast this result with the “method wherein the ﬁbers are mixed in a molten resin,” citing
Gamble, col. 7, lines 14-25, which process they also describe as “dispersing ﬁbers in a resin matrix,”
citing Gamble, col. 5, lines 6-15 (id., page 8). In other words, appellants allege that ‘the Board
conﬁlses ‘mixing ﬁbers in an aqueous sltmy’ With ‘mixing ﬁbers in a resin’" (id., n.4; see also page 9).
Thus, the issue of claim interpretation involves essentially the ﬁrst stated step of the claimed method
encompassed by claim 1.

The difﬁculty that we have with appellants’ position is that (1) they have not stated why our
interpretation of the terms of claim 1 which lead us to apply the teachings of Gamble thereto as set forth
in our original opinion is unreasonable in light of the speciﬁcation as it would be interpreted by one of
ordinary skill in this art; (2) they have not expressly stated their interpretation of the cited claimed phrase

the ﬁbers canbeuniforrnlydkpersedby shaking “in amoltenresin” or “in aresinrnatrix,” the latterterm

As werecognizedinouroriginalopinion (page3), theinterpretationofthescopeofthe

In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1054-55, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“[T]he PTO
applies to the verbiage of the proposed claims the broadest reasonable meaning of the words ir1 their
ordinary usage as they would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, taking into account
whatever enlightenment by way of deﬁnitions or otherwise that may be afforded by the written
description contained in the applicant’s speciﬁcation.” , without reading into these claims any limitation
or particular embodiment which is disclosed in the speciﬁcation. See In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321-
22, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989), citing In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162

citing Prater, 415 F.2d at 1405, 162 USPQ at 551. Thus, the terms in the appealed claims must be
given their ordinary meaning unless another meaning is intended by appellants as established in their
speciﬁcation. See, e. g., Morris, supra; Zlet; supra (“During patent prosecution the pending claims
must be interpreted as broadly as their terms reasonably allow. When the applicant states the meaning
that the claim terms are intended to have, the claims are examined with that meaning, in order to achieve
a complete exploration of the applicant’s invention and its relation to the prior art. [Citations omitted.]”).
When the speciﬁcation does not contain an express deﬁnition, we can an'iVe at a reasonable, supported
interpretation of the appealed claims that differs from that urged by applicants and determine the
patentability of the claims on that basis. Morris, 127 F.3d at 1055-56, 44 USPQ2d at 1028-30
(“Absent an express deﬁnition in their speciﬁcation, the fact that appellants can point to deﬁnitions or
usages that conform to their interpretation does not make the PTO’s deﬁnition unreasonable when the
PTO can point to other sources that support its interpretation”). Therefore, “[i]t is the applicants’
burden to precisely deﬁne the invention, not the PTO’s. See 35 U.S.C. § 112 ‘j[ 2 [statute omitted].”
Morris, supra.

We did not speciﬁcally interpret all or any part of the phrase “ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in
the resin” (emphasis supplied) appearing in the ﬁrst speciﬁed step of claim 1 in our original opinion.
We did interpret the transitional term “comprising” in the preamble to “open the claimed method to
include other steps,” on the authority of In re Baxter, 656 F.2d 679, 686-87, 210 USPQ 795, 802-03
(CCPA 1981) (opinion, page 4). We further interpreted the phrase “coating material comprising ﬁbers

and resin” ir1 view of the open—ended term “comprising” to

-11-




*** PAGE 12 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

further include any manner of ingredients, s11ch as viscosity modiﬁers, solvents or ﬂocculating
agents, which would facilitate or otherwise aﬂect the uniform distribution of any ﬁber
in the resin and/or the application of the mixed coating material composition on a substrate
(speciﬁcation, e.g., page 4, lines 16- 19, and page 6, lines 17-24). Baxter, supra. [Id.;
emphasis supplied.]

Thus, we found that mixing ﬁbers with resin in water in Gamble Example I resulted in a uniform
distribution of ﬁbers in the resin (id., pages 6-9).

We have not found a deﬁnition for the claim phrase “ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in the resin”
per se in our review of appellants’ speciﬁcation Nor have we found any disclosure which would
provide a deﬁnition for any part thereof, including “in the resin” and “resin.” The disclosure which
appears to pertain to the ﬁrst step of the claimed method encompassed by claim 1 is that “[t]he
S11CCBSSflll utilization of artiﬁcial dielectric coatings requires a uniform dispersion of ﬁbers in a resin matrix
and then applying the ﬁber-containing resin matrix onto a substrate in such manner as to provide random
ﬁber placement and uniform thiclmess control’ (page 3). It wo11ld thus appear that the art recognized
requirement is “a uniform dispersion of ﬁbers in a resin matrix” which can be applied to a substrate in a
“manner as to provide random ﬁber placement and uniform thiclmess control.” Indeed, the speciﬁcation
(e.g., pages 4-6) provides no further processing information other than the nature of the ﬁbers, the
physical manipulation by which the ﬁbers and resin are mixed and, with respect to the “resin,” that

[t]he ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in a lightly loaded dielectric matrix material. The matrix
material comprises a resin material which preferably is a non— thermoplastic material. For

instance, the resin can comprise a thermosetting polymer material such as silicone. [Id., page
6.]

There is no deﬁnition of “matrix” in the speciﬁcation. The speciﬁcation concludes with a statement that
the disclosure is non—lirr1itir1g (id.).

On this record, we interpret the bare term “resin” in appealed claim 1 to have the customary,
ordinary meaning of a polyuneric resinous material recognized in the art of electromagnetic-attenuating
coatings. We ﬁrrther ﬁnd that the polymeric resinous material must be capable of forming a “matrix,” as
this term is ordinarily deﬁned, within which ﬁbers can be contained in a coating material such that the
coating material will form a coating containing the ﬁbers when applied to a substrate. There is no
limitation in claim 1 which would limit the “resin” other than its capability to form the stated coating.

-12-




*** PAGE 13 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

Thus, we arrive at the point where our interpretation of claim 1 differs from that apparently
urged by appellants. The ordinary meaning of “matrix” is “A . . . surrounding substance within which
something originates, develops or is contained.” See, e. g., The American Heritage Dictionary
Second College Addition 772-73 (Boston, Houghton Miﬂlin Company, 1982). We have found no
ordinary deﬁnition of the term “matrix” which requires that the “surrounding substance” must necessarily
be a solid. The interpretation apparently urged by appellants is that the resin would form a solid
“matrix,” but they have not pointed to the basis in the speciﬁcation as it would be interpreted by one of
ordinary skill in the art or elsewhere for their interpretation.

Therefore, on this record, we ﬁnd it reasonable to interpret the claim phrase “ﬁbers are
uniformly dispersed hr the resin” to encompass ﬁbers uniformly dispersed in a resin matrix wherein the
resin surrounding the ﬁbers is in particulate form. Indeed, such amixtnre ofﬁbers unifrnnlydispersedin
a matrix of particulate resin would form a coating or sheet in which the ﬁbers would be randomly
oriented in the manner required for “successﬁtl utilimtion of artiﬁcial dielectric coatings” as stated in
appellants’ speciﬁcation (page 3), and, in our view, as shown by Gamble (e.g., col. 2, line 64, to col. 3,
line 7, col. 6, line 60, to col. 7, line 5, and Example 1). We are not persuaded otherwise by the use of
water by Gamble to disperse the ﬁbers in a resin matrix. Indeed, as we noted above, we interpreted the
claimed phrase “coating nmterial comprising ﬁbers and resin” in our original opinion to further comprise
any material “which would facilitate or otherwise affect the uniform distribution of any ﬁber in the resin.”
This would include water.

Accordingly, because appellants have not established that, on this record, our interpretation of
the claim terms of claim 1 is unreasonable, Morris, supra, we decline to reverse our afﬁrmance of the
examiner’s ground of rejection.

We have granted appellant's request to the extent that we have reconsidered our decision of
February 29, 2000, but we deny the request with respect to making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended
under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request reconsideration (rehearing) of our
decision of May l8, 2000, wherein we affirmed the examiner's
rejection of the appealed claims under 35 U.S.C. §§ l02 and

l03.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. l997—O855
Application No. 08/248,543

Appellants submit at page 2 of the Request that we
inexplicably adopted the examiner's reasoning that element (d)
of claim 22 is "met by water supplied by conduit 45 to adjust
the consistency in mix tank 32" (page 4 of Answer).
Appellants maintain that "the means of element (d) must supply
'a slurry of fiber in liquid water,'" whereas "[p]ure water
supplied through conduit 45 of Cheshire 'l56 cannot satisfy
element (d)." Appellants contend that "mix tank 32, conduit
35 and pump 34 are not capable of supplying a slurry of fiber
in ‘liquid water‘ as mix tank 32 contains a 'foam—fiber'
mixture — not a 'slurry of fiber in liquid water'" (page 2 of
Request).

We are not persuaded by this argument because Cheshire
'956 expressly discloses that pump 34 is activated to supply
foamable liquid from silo 26 and mix tank 32 to the headbox.
Hence, the material delivered to the headbox through line 35
is a liquid that is capable of generating a foam.

Appellants also contend at page 2 of the Request that
"Cheshire fails to disclose a ‘means for combining said water
slurry of fibers with said foamed liquid‘ as required by

element (e)." In our view, it is clear from reading the




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-0855
Application No. 08/248,543

entirety of the Cheshire patents, e.g., '956 at column 5,
lines 11 g;_§gg‘, that lines 35 and 24 carry both liquid and
foam and are combined at the T in a mixture of foamed liquid
and a water slurry of fibers.

Appellants also submit at page 3 of the Request that we
erroneously concluded that claims 23-25 fall together with
claim 22. Appellants point out that the Brief states at page
9 that "[c]laims 23, 24 and 25 contain additional features
which make each of them separately patentable." However, such
a conclusory statement falls far short of the requisite
presentation of substantive arguments which explain why each
of claims 23, 24 and 25 would have been nonobvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art. See 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7) and
(c)(8) (1995). In the opening sentence of the paragraph at
page 9 of the Brief, referred to by appellants, appellants
treat all the appealed claims as a group. In particular,
appellants state that "[e]ach appealed claim in this
application (22-25) contains a limitation requiring: means
for mixing an aqueous slurry of fibers with foam to form a
foamed fiber furnish." Although appellants maintain at page 3

of the Request that "much of Applicants [sic, Applicants']

Appeal No. 1997-0855

oral argument focused on the patentability of claim 24 as a

result of the novel incorporation of a positive displacement
pump" (emphasis added), it is well settled that arguments not
contained in the Brief are considered abandoned, and that such

abandonment cannot be resurrected at oral hearing.

We note that appellants point to no argument in the Brief that

holding that claims 23-25 stand or fall together.

request is granted to the extent we have reconsidered our

decision, but we decline to make any change therein.

Ex parte ROY D. SEEL

Appeal No. 1997-2021
Application No. 08/500,231

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, HAIRSTON and KRASS, Administrative Patent
Judges

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

In a paper filed September 20, 2000, appellant requests
that we reconsider or rehear our decision dated March 22,
2000, where— in we sustained the rejection of claims 21
through 24, 26 through 28, 30 and 31 under the public use
clause of 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). The application file reveals

that subsequent to our earlier decision in March, appellant




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1997-2021
Application No. 08/500,231

was granted various extensions of time to file this request

for rehearing.

Pages 2 and 3 of our original opinion set forth a brief
file history of prosecution of this application as well as its
earlier applications.

This is the fourth appeal in this application before the
Board. As indicated at page 3 of our original decision, after
the third decision on appeal, appellant sought relief at
Federal District Court in the District of Columbia. The
present application was filed at the direction of the
presiding judge in that appeal with instructions that
declarations of all those who saw the video booth more than
one year before the great grandparent application Serial No.
07/170,924, filed on March 21, 1988, should be filed in the
present application. Therefore, the critical date in question
is March 22, 1987.

At the outset, to the extent appellant's request for
rehearing urges a reconsideration of the decision rendered in
each of the first three appeals, as set forth more or less in

the first twenty six paragraphs of the request for rehearing,

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-2021
Application No. 08/500,231

the request is denied. Appellant has long lost any rights
accorded to him under the rules of practice to seek any relief

for any

alleged errors in these earlier decisions on appeal. Of those
first three appeals taken by appellant during earlier
prosecution of parent applications of this application, a
request for reconsid—eration was filed in a timely manner only
with respect to the second appeal in Appeal No. 92-1594 which
request was denied on June 18, 1992. We are unaware of any
provision of 37 CFR § 1.197 which permits appellant to seek a
reconsideration of prior appeals after the time set therefor
has expired.

We have considered appellant's positions set forth
between paragraphs 27 and 44 of the request for rehearing. It
is believed that the discussion at pages 4 and 5 of our
original opinion in effect basically still answers the urgings
for reconsideration set forth in the above noted paragraphs.

For emphasis, we repeat again the essence of the statement we

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1997-2021
Application No. 08/500,231

made at page 4 of our original opinion that the focus of the
affirmance of the rejection was, as urged by the examiner, the
absence of any curative and subsequent declarations from
declarants McLaughlin, Goman, Floam [sic: Flom] specifying the
year in which they each saw the video booth located in the so-

called Commercial

Craft facility. We did not accept in our original opinion nor
do we accept now, without confirming declarations, appellant's
own declarations or those of others averring or otherwise
declaring that declarants McLaughlin, Goman and Flom agreed to
the confidentially and limited control of the video booth in
this Commercial Craft facility before the critical date. We
do not question that appellant's own direct declaration and
those of other individuals may be probative of a pattern of
behavior of individuals agreeing to the confidentiality and
limited control of access of the video booth at the time it
was seen by the respective individuals.

We made specific findings at the top of page 5 of our

4




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1997-2021
Application No. 08/500,231

original opinion regarding the declarations of Mr. Flom and
Goman. Mr. Flom's declaration of August 2, 1989, indicates
that he saw the prototype booth operating satisfactory during
the month of September 1987, but this declaration contains no
statement of confidentiality and no statement as to where the
booth was located when it was seen by the declarant. The
subsequently filed declaration filed in August of 1995 from
Mr. Flom, although it includes a statement of confidentiality,

does

not indicate in what year he observed the booth in operation
at the Commercial Craft facility. Because this is a
subsequently filed declaration, we do not have the certainty
we require that the booth was seen to be operated after the
critical date of March 22, 1987. The observations by Mr. Flom
past the critical date are not probative of the issue before
us.

A similar conclusion can be reached with the declarations
from Mr. Goman. His July 31, 1987, declaration indicates that

he saw the prototype video booth operating satisfactory during

5




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1997-2021
Application No. 08/500,231

the month of April 1987, while, on the other hand, the
subsequently filed declaration on July 31, 1995 does not
include the year in which Mr. Goman saw the operation of the
booth at the Commercial Craft facility even though the
declaration of this date indicates an agreement as to
confidentiality. The initial declaration contains no
statement as to where the booth was located when it was seen
by the declarant. Again, any events that occurred after the
critical date are not probative of the issue before us as it
applies to Mr. Goman.

As to the third individual in question, Mr. McLaughlin,
his initial declaration of July 31, 1989 indicates that he saw

the

prototype video booth operating satisfactory during the month
of March 1987. While not indicating any sense of any
agreement as to confidentiality in this declaration, it cannot
be determined

from this declaration that he saw the operation of the

prototype




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1997-2021

video booth before or after the critical date of March 22,
1987. There is also no statement as to where the booth was
located when it was seen by the declarant. His subsequently
filed declaration filed on July 31, 1995, does not cure these
defects even though it does indicate that a sense of
confidentiality was agreed to while at the same time no year
was specified as to when he observed the prototype booth in
the Commercial Craft facility. Again, since this was a
subsequently filed declaration, we remain unpersuaded that he
agreed to any sense of confidentiality before the critical
date.

In essence, we remain unconvinced that all of the people
who observed the prototype video booth in operation before the
critical date agreed to the confidentiality and limited
control thereof at the Commercial Craft facility as required
at the direction of the presiding judge in the Federal
District Court discussed earlier in this opinion and noted at
the top of page 3 of our earlier opinion. Even if we consider

collectively both

declarations from each of the three declarants, McLaughlin,

Flom and Goman, it has not been convincingly established to us
by their own declarations that each of them respectively
agreed to the confidentiality concerning any demonstrations of
the prototype claimed invention before the critical date. It
is not sufficient for appellant and/or other people to make
declarations that other people were made subject to
confidentiality and the complete control of the facility was
maintained prior to the critical date without confirming
declarations or affidavits from the respectively named
individuals. As set forth at the bottom of page 4 of our
original opinion, we can conclude only that ng; all of the
people who saw the video booth at the Commercial Craft
facility were made subject to secrecy agreements and that
complete control of that facility was not maintained prior to
the critical date. The public policy considerations
underlying the prior public use provisions of 35 U.S.C. §
lO2(b) demand no less.

Finally, we considered at page 5 of our original opinion,
the particulars regarding the alleged special consideration
aspects of appellant's arguments relating to independent claim

31 and its dependent claims. This claim focuses on the two-

mirror feature of the claimed invention. We required proper,
additional declarations from the three earlier noted
individuals subsequent to our earlier decision on appeal to
obviate any sub-

issue with respect to the special considerations as well as
the assertion of private experimental use also discussed at
the bottom of page 6 of our last decision in Appeal No. 94-
1463 to which we made specific reference and incorporated by
reference into our original opinion in March of this year
(2000). Paragraphs 46 and 47 of appellant's request for
rehearing merely indicate that appellant's attempts to seek
the subsequent declarations "were unsuccessful". In paragraph
47 of the request for rehearing appellant urges the allowance
of claim 31 and its dependent claims "because these
indiviguals [sic] said it was too long ago to specifically
recall details about their involvement with the booth." On
their face, appellant's urgings do not convince us of any

error in our original opinion as to any subissue relating to

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte JOHN R. J. SORENSON

Appeal No. 1997-3047
Application O8/480,152

ON BRIEF

Before GARRIS, WARREN and OWENS, Administrative Patent Judges.

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests reconsideration of our decision mailed
on December 22, 2000, wherein we affirmed the rejections of
claims 1-8 under the judicially created doctrine of
obviousness—type double patenting over claims 1-9 of Sorenson

‘834 and over claims l—8 of Sorenson ‘l7l. We treat this




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. l997—3047
Application O8/480,152

request as a request for rehearing under 37 CFR

§ l.l97(b)(l997).

Appellant argues that the examiner's January 15, l976
restriction requirement established that the generic claim was
separately patentable from the species claims (request,
pages 2-3). What the examiner stated in the restriction
requirement (pages 2-3) is that “[s]ince the various compounds
embraced by the claims are not so related that a prior art
reference anticipating the claims in respected [sic] to
certain members would render the claims obvious in respect to
other members, applicant is further, required to elect a
single disclosed species and to list all claims readable
thereon including claims subsequently added.” This statement
clearly pertains to separate patentability among the species,
and not to separate patentability of the genus and any of the
species therein, because a reference which anticipates a
specie also anticipates a genus which encompasses that specie.

See In re Gosteli, 872 F.2d lOO8, lOlO, lO USPQ2d l6l4, l6l6

(Fed. Cir. l989).




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3047
Application O8/480,152

Appellant argues that consonance is not an absolute
requirement for 35 U.S.C. § 121 to apply (request, page 3).

Appellant relies upon Applied Materials Inc. v. Advanced
Semiconductor Materials, 98 F.3d 1563, 1568, 40 USPQ2d 1481,

1484 (Fed. Cir. 1996), wherein the majority stated that “even
if such consonance [i.e., demarcation among the separate
inventions] is lost, double patenting does not follow if the
requirements of § 121 are met or if the claims are in fact
patentably distinct."1 Section 121 requires that inventions
which are restricted from each other must be independent and
distinct from each other. As explained in our decision (pages
5-6), the generic claims in the present case are not
independent and distinct from the claims in Sorenson ‘834 or
Sorenson ‘171. Appellant, therefore, is not entitled to the
benefit of 35 U.S.C. § 121.

Appellant argues that Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs. Inc.,

1 In a dissent—in—part, Judge Archer, citing Gerber
Garment Technology, Inc. V. Lectra Sys., 916 F.2d 683, 688, 16
USPQ2d 1436, 1440 (Fed. Cir. 1990), stated that “[t]his court
has ruled, however, that the protection of § 121 is only
available for claims issued on a divisional application that
are consonant with the examiner's restriction requirement."
Applied Materials, 98 F.3d at 1577, 40 USPQ2d at 1492.

222 F.3d 973, 987, 55 USPQ2d 1609, 1619 (Fed. Cir. 2000),
relied upon by the board (decision, pages 8-9), is contrary to
prior controlling law (request, pages 3-4). Appellant argues

that In re Stanley, 214 F.2d 151, 102 USPQ 234 (CCPA 1954)

indicates that mere dominance by generic claims is not

decisive (request, page 4). In Stanley, the Truitt patent had

the same assignee as the appellant's application, was based
upon an application filed more than two years after the
appellant's application was filed, and contained claims which
were limited to an improvement over the appellant's generic

claims. Stanley, 214 F.2d at 152 and 158, 102 USPQ at 235 and
240. The court in Stanley, 214 F.2d at 156, 102 USPQ at 238,
citing In re Mann, 47 F.2d 370, 8 USPQ 381 (CCPA 1931), noted

what it called an exception to the obviousness—type double
patenting rejection:

In certain cases, where there are two
applications by different inventors, but held by a
common assignee, and there is a disclosure of the
same basic invention in both applications, but in
one of which it is asserted that the applicant is
the inventor only of an improvement in the basic
invention disclosed, a patent issued upon the
improvement claim [sic] in such last named
application is not a bar to a patent upon the other
application....




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. l997—3047
Application O8/480,152

The court in Stanley stated:

We are of the opinion that the generic invention is
not rendered unpatentable by the fact that a prior
patent has been issued on a distinct improvement of
that invention. We think this appeal clearly comes
within the exception set out in the Mann and
Koppleman case, supra, since none of the appealed
claims could have been made on the Truitt
disclosure, nor do both applications disclose the
same invention. Further, we think that the

appellants should not be denied a patent for their
invention because of the specific improvement patent
to Truitt merely on the basis of the common
assignee.

Stanley, 214 F.2d at l59, lO2 USPQ at 240.

The court in Stanley discussed Thomson—Houston Electric
Co. v. Ohio Brass Co., 80 F. 7l2 (6th Cir. l897), which is
relied upon by appellant (request, pages 3-4). The Stanley
court stated that in Thomson—Houston, the court held that the
‘45l patent, which was drawn to distinct and specific
structural improvements in the device claimed in the ‘695
patent which was based on an application filed more than a
year before the filing of the application which led to the
first—to—issue ‘45l patent, did not render the ‘695 patent

invalid. See Stanley, 214 F.2d at l54—55, lO2 USPQ at 237.

Thus, the facts in Thomson—Houston were comparable to those in




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. l997-3047
Application O8/480,152

Stanley, and the decisions in these cases were consistent with
each other.

The facts in Lilly, however, were quite different from
the facts in Stanley and Thomson—Houston. In Lilly, claim l

of the ‘895 patent recited treating depression in humans by
administering a compound within a genus which included
fluoxetine hydrochloride, and claim 7 of the ‘549 patent
recited administering fluoxetine hydrochloride to an animal to
block serotonin uptake in the animal's brain neurons. See
Lilly, 222 F.3d at 978-79, 55 USPQ2d at l6l2—l3. The
applications which led to the ‘895 and ‘549 patents were
filed, respectively, on September 17, l975 and March 31, l986,
and issued, respectively, on April 19, l977 and December 2,
l986. According to the court, both claimed benefit under 35
U.S.C. § l2O of the filing date of an application filed in
1974. See Lilly, 222 F.3d at 978-79, 55 USPQ2d at l6l2—l3.
The court stated that “[t]hroughout the term of the ‘895
patent, by virtue of claim l’s broad coverage, Lilly possessed
the right to exclude other parties from administering any of

the thousands of claimed compounds, including but not limited




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3047
Application O8/480,152

to fluoxetine hydrochloride, to treat depression.” See Lilly,

222 F.3d at 986-87, 55 USPQ2d at 1618. According to the

court:
The only discernible difference between claim 1 of
the ‘895 patent and claim 7 of the ‘549 patent is
that the former addresses the treatment of
depression in humans while the latter addresses the
treatment of serotonin uptake in animals. Humans
are a species of the animal genus, and depression is
a species ailment of the genus of ailments caused by
defective serotonin uptake. Our case law firmly
establishes that a later genus claim is not
patentable over an earlier species claim.

Lilly, 222 F.3d 987, 55 USPQ2d 1619.

Thus, contrary to appellant's argument, Lilly is not
inconsistent with Stanley and Thomson—Houston. Stanley and
Thomson—Houston involved the situation in which a later filed

application claiming a specie within a genus issues before an
earlier filed application which claims the genus. In both of
those cases, the courts held that the specie claims could not
be used to reject claims to the genus in an obviousness—type
double patenting rejection. The court in Stanley indicated
that prior courts applied a two—way test for obviousness—type

double patenting in such a situation. See Stanley, 214 F.2d

at 155, 102 F.2d 238. Appellant in the present case has not

7




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3047
Application O8/480,152

argued that a two—way test should be used. Lilly, on the
other hand, involved the situation in which two patents have
the same effective filing date, the first filed and issued
application claims a specie and the later filed application
claims a genus. The court held that in that situation the
later genus claim is unpatentable under the doctrine of
obviousness—type double patenting over the earlier specie
claim.

The present case is similar to Lilly in that the Sorenson
references and the present application have the same effective
filing date, the earlier filed and issued Sorenson patents
claim species, and the present application claims a genus
which encompasses the species. In the present case it is the
compositions themselves which have a specie—genus
relationship, rather than the uses having that relationship as
in Lilly. As explained in Lilly and the cases relied upon
therein, in such a situation the genus is considered to be
unpatentable over the specie under the doctrine of

obviousness—type double patenting. See Lilly, 222 F.3d at

987, 55 USPQ2d at 1619.

WILLIAM F. SMITH.

Appellant requests rehearing of this appeal in light of our decision entered January
11, 2001 (Paper No. 21) wherein we vacated the examiner's rejection and instituted a new
of round of rejection under 37 CFR § 1.196(b). This rule provides




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3137

Application No. 07/978,670

appellant with two options. First, appellant may submit an appropriate amendment of the
claims or a showing of facts relating to the claims and have the matter reconsidered by the
examiner, in which event the application will be remanded to the examiner. Second,
appellant may request that the appeal be reheard by the Board upon the same record. At
pae one of the request for rehearin appellant states that he wishes to “be reheard under
37 CFR § 1.197(b) upon the same record, as supplemented by the arguments set forth
herein and as supported by the accompanying declaratiors of Joseph Hines and Dr.
Douglas Burkett.” Manifestly, the request is improper. In essence, appellant is requesting
that we create a third option under 37 CFR § 1.196(b). We decline to do so.

Since appellant's submissions have created a new record, we interpret appellant's
intent is to have the matter reoonsidered by the examiner upon the new record.
Accordingly, we remand the application to the examiner to consider appe|lant’s
submissions and take whatever action is deemed appropriate.

Appellant’s request for rehearing is denied to the extent it asks the merits panel to

review the new ground of rejection in light of the new record. Upon return of the

FLEMING, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request that we reconsider our decision dated
May 31, 2000, with respect to affirming the Examiner's
decision rejecting claims 14-18 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second

paragraph.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. l997—3472
Application O8/405,278

Appellants argue on page 3 that claim l, from which claim
l4 depends, recites that the rotor is integrated with a disk
in a one piece assembly. Appellants argue that claim 1 is
broadly written and does not recite that the rotor must be
directly attached coplanar to only the perimeter of the disk
as shown in the Figure l embodiment. Appellants argue that
claim l4 is another species in which the rotor l6d is now
being defined with its cooperating rotor shaft 34d as joined
to the plural disk. Appellants argue that the structure as
recited in claim l4 is integrated with a disk in a one—piece
assembly as claimed in Appellants‘ claim l. On page 4 of the
request for rehearing, Appellants further point to Appellants‘
specification arguing that it clearly discloses the one—piece
ABS construction of a rotor shaft 34d and disk 12, and the
rotor l6 formed on the shaft. Appellants argue that the
specification expressly discloses at page 12, line l+, that
not only can magnetic coatings be applied to the surface of
the ABS disk l2, but the entire rotor l6d may be formed from a

suitable magnetic material. Appellants argue that this is

_2_




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3472
Application 08/405,278

ample support in the specification for a one—piece assembly of
the disk 12, rotor shaft 34d and rotor l6d recited in claim 14
and expressly illustrated in Figure 8.

In our May 31, 2000 decision, we interpreted Appellants’
claim l4 language, "a plurality of storage disks coaxially
joined to a rotor shaft and axially spaced from each other for
allowing independent access thereto, and said rotor is
coaxially joined to said rotor shaft and axially spaced from
said disk for simultaneously rotating of said disk", as
reciting separate pieces being attached together. We found
that the structure recited in Appellants‘ claim 14 was not "a
rotor integrated with said disk in a one piece assembly" as
recited in claim 1 because claim 14 was reciting structure
that included independent pieces being attached together which
is not a one—piece integrated assembly. Having benefit of
Appellants‘ arguments as set forth in the request for
rehearing, we find that claim 14 language is simply labeling
the parts of a one—piece assembly in which the rotor is
integrated with the disk. We agree with the Appellants that
in viewing the claim language in this light, the claim 1

recital of "a rotor integrated with a disk in a one—piece

_3_




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3472
Application O8/405,278

assembly" is broad enough in scope to include the structure as
recited in claim 14 in which the assembly is a rotor
integrated with a disk in a one piece assembly in which there
is a plurality of disks coaxially joined to a rotor shaft and

axially spaced from said disk.

In view of this interpretation of claim 14, we thereby
find that we can determine the scope of claim 14.
Accordingly, we reverse the rejection of claims 14-18 under 35
U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph. Furthermore, we reverse the
rejection of claims 14-18 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 for the same
reasons that we set forth in our opinion dated May 31, 2000.

In regard to whether the specification supports the
interpretation of claim 14 in which there is a disclosure of
an integrated one—piece assembly having a plurality of storage
disks coaxially joined to a rotor shaft and axially spaced
apart from each other for allowing independent access thereto
and said rotor is coaxially joined to said rotor shaft and
axially spaced from the disk for simultaneously rotating of
said disk, we note that this issue is not before us for our

decision. We will leave this to the Examiner to determine if

FRANKFORT, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to appellant's request for rehearing of
our decision mailed July 31, 2000, wherein we affirmed the

examiner's rejection of claims 1 through 6 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. l998—O838
Application No. 08/265,858

We have carefully considered each of the points of argument
raised by appellant in the request for rehearing, however, those
arguments do not persuade us that our prior decision was in error

in any respect.

In contrast with appellant's position that we have
misapprehended the primary distinction between the prior art
applied by the examiner and appellant's invention, we recognize
that the slag handling system disclosed by appellant and that
disclosed in Hibbel are not the same, however, it is the claimed
subject matter which we have evaluated in this appeal relative to
the applied prior art and not the system as specifically
disclosed by appellant. During the prosecution of a patent
application, claims are given their broadest reasonable
interpretation consistent with the specification. See Ig_re
gneed, 710 F.2d 1544, 1548, 218 USPQ 385, 388 (Fed. Cir. 1983);
In re Tanaka, 551 F.2d 855, 860, 193 USPQ 138, 141 (CCPA 1977).
However, limitations in the specification will not be read into
the claims. See In re Winkhaus, 527 F.2d 637, 639, 188 USPQ 129,
131 (CCPA 1975). In this particular case, we have given the
claimed slag handling system and, more particularly, the claim

language “closed loop sluice water system” in appellant's




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-0838
Application No. 08/265,858

independent claim 1 on appeal its broadest reasonable
interpretation and found that it is readable on the closed loop
sluice water system in Hibbel which transports slag from the
separating chamber (43) and lock vessel (6) in a water/slag
mixture into the collecting vessel or sump pit (22). Appellant
has pointed to nothing in the claims on appeal (particularly,
independent claim 1) which in any way changes our views as set

forth on pages 5 through 10 of our earlier decision.

The fact that appellant's invention as disclosed may be a
substitute for the mechanical device (49) of Hibbel and that the
system or process in Hibbel may be an appropriate process
precursor to appellant's process, is of no avail, since the
claims before us on appeal (specifically independent claim 1) do
not include any limitations which make or require any such
distinctions in the claimed subject matter. For that reason, we
remain of the view expressed in our earlier decision concerning

the obviousness of the subject matter set forth in appellant's

Claims on appeal.




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. l998—O838
Application No. 08/265,858

In light of the foregoing, appellant's request is granted to
the extent of reconsidering (rehearing) our earlier decision, but

is denied with respect to making any changes therein.

connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

HEARD: January 24, 2001

Before JOHN D. SMITH, WARREN, and DELMENDO, Admi ' ativ ent
Judges.

DELMENDO, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Pursuant to the provisions of 37 CFR § l.l97(b) (1997), the
appellants have submitted a request for rehearing of our decision
entered February 20, 2001, in which we affirmed the examiner's
rejection of appealed claims 9 and 10 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 but
reversed the rejection of appealed claims 2 through 8, 23 through 28,

and 30 through 44 under the same ground.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1663
Application No. 08/508,408

The appellants argue as follows:

The above step [i.e., the sputtering step of appealed
claim 9] clearly recites that the titanium film is sputter
deposited and that the sputter deposited film is a metal
film. After the titanium film is deposited, the oxidizing
step is pracziced. Clearly claim 9 recites that the step
of sputtering and the step of oxidizing are separate
steps. In i:s broadest reading the “sputtering and
oxidizing steps" of claim 9 are not conducted in one step.
[Request for rehearing, p. 2.]

The appellanzs then submit as follows:

Finley as read by the Board teaches sputtering to
deposit a tizanium oxide film. Applicants’ claim 9 as
discussed above covers sputtering to deposit a titanium
film and thereafter, oxidizing the deposited film.

Based on the above, applicants respectfully submit
that Finley zeaches depositing a metal oxide film; Khanna
also teaches depositing a metal oxide film. An artisan
combining Khanna and Finley would deposit a metal oxide
film. Applicants’ claims 9 and 10 on the other hand
recite that an amorphous titanium film, more particularly
a metal amorphous titanium film, is deposited, and
thereafter the film is oxidized. [Id. at pp.2—3.]

We cannot agree. As we stated in our original decision (page

6), appealed claim 9, unlike claim 31, does not recite that the
deposition of the film is operated below the “switch point.” Nor is
there any recitation in claim 9 that the deposition is conducted in
the “metallic mode” as described in the present specification.
Although the appellants urge that the recited oxidizing step is

practiced after the titanium film is deposited, appealed claim 9 does




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1663
Application No. 08/508,408

not preclude the sputtering of a titanium film and the oxidation of
the film in one step. This is exactly what occurs in Finley or

Khanna.

In addition, appealed claim 9 does not recite the term “after”
or “thereafter” as the appellants seem to think. In re Morris, 127
F.3d 1048, 1056, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“It is the
applicants’ burden to precisely define the invention, not the
PTO’s.").

According to the appellants’ specification, “[t]he amount of
reactive gas is kept sufficiently low so that the sputtering mode is
essentially metallic, and the film deposited is essentially
metallic." (Underscoring added; page 14.) The term “essentially”
would indicate to one skilled in the relevant art that in the
broadest reasonable interpretation of appealed claim 9, the film
deposited by sputtering includes not only purely metallic but also
metal oxide films. Where the film deposited by sputtering is a metal
oxide, the oxidizing step would have occurred during the sputtering
step as in Finley or Khanna. In our view, the use of the term
“titanium film” as it appears in appealed claim 9 is purely a matter

of semantics, as one skilled in the relevant art would understand

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1663
Application No. 08/508,408

this term in its broadest context to actually include titanium oxide
layers deposited in a “slightly oxidizing atmosphere" as described

in Finley or about 28% reactive gas as described in Khanna.

The appellants have proposed amending appealed claim 9 to

positively recite that the deposited film is a “titanium metal

film" and that the sputtering and oxidizing steps are separately
conducted, in the event that we agree appealed claim 9 “inherently
recites” these limitations. (Request, page 3.) However, 37 CFR §
l.l97(b) does not provide for such a proposal to amend appealed claim
9 at this stage. Therefore, it is not appropriate. Further, we do
not agree with the appellants that the limitations are “inherently”
recited in appealed claim 9. Quite oppositely, we find that the
appellants’ conditional proposal to amend further supports our
determination that appealed claim 9 is significantly broader in scope
than that argued by the appellants.

In summary, we have reconsidered our decision in light of all

of the arguments made in the appellants’ request. However, we see no
compelling reason justifying a different result. Accordingly, we

decline to modify our original decision.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

KRASS, Administrative Eatgpt Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests rehearing and reconsideration of our
decision of June 30, 2000 wherein we affirmed the examiner's

decision rejecting claims 1, ll, 12, 16-18 and 25 under 35




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1748
Application No. 08/758,295

U.S.C. 102(b) and rejecting claims 1, 9, 16 and 25 under 35
U.S.C. 103.

In particular, appellant takes issue with our
interpretation of the claimed shield being “readily
deformable." Appellant contends that while they agree that
all materials are “deformable” to a degree, this does not mean
that all materials, such as that in the reference to Kirschner

are “readily deformable,"

as claimed. Appellant points to
instant Figure 3 for an illustration of what is intended by
“readily deformable." Figure 3 shows a shield being pushed in
by a falling coffee mug. Appellant's position is that
“readily deformable” is clearly defined in claim 1 in stating
that the purpose of the shield being “readily deformable” is
to protect the display screen on which it is mounted.

We disagree. We find nothing in claim 1 which would
distinguish the shield being “readily deformable” from that
which is disclosed by Kirschner. While the primary purpose of
the shield in Kirschner is to reduce the amount of ambient
light impinging on the screen, the shield also clearly
protects the screen. Moreover, since the material of the

shield in Kirschner does deform to some degree and deforms

_2_




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. l998—l748
Application No. 08/758,295

“immediately” upon impact by an object, we hold that

” as claimed and as

Kirschner’s shield is “readily deformable,
defined by appellant. The shields of Kirschner and appellant
may differ by the amount, or degree, of deformation, but we
find no language in the instant claims which would distinguish
over that disclosed by Kirschner.

At the bottom of page 2 of the Request for Rehearing,
appellant states that “Kirschner can only logically be applied
to the skins of Kirschner’s “rigid” composite. Applicant's
claim l sets forth that the top and sides of the shield can be
readily deformed, not just the skins thereof.”

Appellant's argument is not well taken. If, by “skins,”
appellant refers to the flexible vinyl cover sheets overlying
the laminated chipboard of Kirschner’s shield, the top and
sides of Kirschner’s shield are both covered by the vinyl
sheets. Therefore, if one accepts that the vinyl coverings,
or “skins,” of Kirschner’s shield are “readily deformable,”
then clearly the top and sides of Kirschner’s shield are, or
can be, readily deformed, as required by claim l. But, we
note again, that in addition to the vinyl covering of

Kirschner being “readily deformable,” the laminated chipboard

_3_




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1748
Application No. 08/758,295

which is covered by the vinyl sheets is also “readily
deformable," to a degree, when impacted by a foreign object.
Thus, the language of instant claim 1 would appear to be
anticipated by Kirschner under alternative interpretations.

At page 3 of the Request for Rehearing, appellant
contends that our decision is “deficient” because while claims
1, 9, l6 and 25 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103, only claim 9
is discussed in the opinion. We addressed only claim 9
because appellant argued the merits of no other claim with
regard to the rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103. If appellant had
arguments with regard to the substance of any other claim,
those arguments should have been presented. Arguments not
made are waived. In re Kroekel, 803 F.2d 705, 231 USPQ 640
(Fed. Cir. 1986). Even in the Request for Rehearing,
appellant offer no arguments as to why the examiner's
rejection of these claims under 35 U.S.C. 103 is in error.

In arguing claim 9 in the Request for Rehearing (pages 3-
4), appellant contends that the Giulie reference does not
disclose the claimed structure wherein the side walls are
releasably cojoined by means of interfitting tabs and slots.

We disagree. Figure 2 of Giulie and the section depicted in

_4_




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1748
Application No. 08/758,295

Figure 3 clearly show that the sides and top of Giulie’s glare
shield are releasably interconnected by “interfitting tabs and
slots" (for example, horizontal portion 29 is a “tab” and gaps
27 and 28 form a “slot"). While Giulie’s joined portions may
differ from the “interfitting tabs and slots" shown in
appellant's drawing wherein the portions are meshed together,
Giulie clearly discloses a glare shield which has a top wall
and two side walls and wherein the side walls are “releasably
joined to said top wall by means of interfitting tabs and
slots," as broadly claimed. Giulie’s portions are
“interfitting” because the tabs of the side portions fit into
the slots of the top portion.

Appellant's Request for Rehearing has been granted to the
extent that we have reconsidered our decision but the request

is denied with respect to making any changes in our decision.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under

37 CFR § l.l36(a).

Application No. 08/549,828

HEARD: MAY 9, 2001

Before STAAB, NASE and BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.
BAHR, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to appellant's request for rehearing
(Paper No. 30, filed July 30, 2001) of our decision (Paper No.
29, dated May 30, 2001) reversing the examiner's rejection of
claims 10-19 and sustaining the examiner's rejection of claims
25 and 26 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being unpatentable over
Wright (U.S. Pat. No. 2,740,168) in view of Thom (U.S. Pat. No.

3,774,342).




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1781
Application No. 08/549,828

Appellant's request submits that this panel has
misapprehended the structure of Wright and misconstrued the
meaning of the language of claim 25. In particular, the request
urges that, contrary to our decision, the fitting (frame member
17) of Wright does not pivot relative to the panel (including
the lower housing 13), that the mounting of the fitting to the
lower housing is not a pivotal mounting, and that we have
misconstrued the claim terminology “mounted” and “rotate in a
plane.”

Turning first to appellant's argument that the frame member
17 of Wright does not pivot relative to the lower housing 13, we
note that the frame member 17 pivots about a point of contact
(at 27) on the track 20. In that the pivotal movement of the
frame member is relative to the lower housing 13, we maintain
our view that the frame member pivots relative to the lower
housing.

As for appellant's argument that the mounting of the
fitting on the panel is required by claim 25 to be a pivotal
connection, in that the mounting via the shafts 24 and openings
23 permits pivotal movement of the frame member 17 relative to

the lower housing 13, we consider the frame member to be

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1781
Application No. 08/549,828

pivotally mounted on the lower housing 13 to pivot relative to
the lower housing.

Appellant's assertion on page 2 of the request that “[f]or
the frame member 17 to pivot relative to the panel 10 (lower
housing 13), there would have to be a pivot axis passing through
both the frame member 17 and the panel 10" is not well founded,
as there is no requirement in claim 25 that the mounting of the
fitting on the panel coincides with the mounting of the fitting
on a common horizontal axis. We remind appellant that
limitations not appearing in the claims cannot be relied upon
for patentability. In re Self, 671 F.2d 1344, 1348, 213 USPQ 1,
5 (CCPA 1982).

As for our interpretation, on page 7 of our decision, of
the term “mounted” in the claim terminology “mounted on a common
horizontal axis" as placed on something raised, in accordance
with the definition of “mount” in Webster's New World
Dictionary, Third College Edition (Simon & Schuster, Inc. 1988),
we observe that, in proceedings before it, the PTO applies to
the verbiage of claims the broadest reasonable meaning of the
words in their ordinary usage as they would be understood by one

of ordinary skill in the art, taking into account whatever

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1781
Application No. 08/549,828

enlightenment by way of definitions or otherwise that may be
afforded by the written description contained in the applicant's
specification. In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d
1023, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Moreover, absent an express
definition in the specification, the fact that appellant can
point to definitions or usages that conform to his
interpretation does not make the PTO's definition unreasonable
when the PTO can point to other sources that support its
interpretation. ;d;, 127 F.3d at 1056, 44 USPQ2d at 1029.

Finally, appellant's request (page 2) contends that “the
plain meaning of claim 25 particularly when read in light of the
drawings and the specification at page 10, lines 26 to 29 is
that it is the central plane of the wheel which is claimed in
claim 25.” Appellant's specification (page 10, lines 26-30)
states that

[t]he bearing profile 20 is pivotably mounted about

the axis 21a, which in the illustrated embodiment is

located laterally outside the central plane of the

castor wheel 17a and laterally outside the central

plane of the bearing profile 20 and also the central

plane of the sliding panel 12.

There is no mention in this discussion of a plane of rotation.

Further, we find no definition of plane of rotation or rotating




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1781
Application No. 08/549,828

in a plane anywhere in appellant's specification. Appellant has
provided no evidence to support the assertion on page 3 of the
request that “one of ordinary skill would interpret the plane of
rotation of the wheel in claim 25 as the central plane”1 and we
are not aware that "rotate in a plane" is a term of art which
refers to the central plane of a rotating wheel or roller. In
fact, we find it equally likely, if not more likely, that one
skilled in the art would consider the face of a rotating wheel
or roller to be the plane in which it rotates. An applicant can
be his own lexicographer provided the applicant's definition, to

the extent it differs from the conventional definition, is

clearly set forth in the specification. Bea er '1
 , 31 F-3d 1154, 1158. 31

USPQ2d 1653, 1656 (Fed. Cir. 1994). As appellant has not
clearly set forth a definition of the plane of rotation of the
wheel, our treatment of the claim language “disposed to rotate
in a plane spaced laterally of said common horizontal axis” on
page 7 of our decision is not unreasonable. While such an

interpretation is broad, it would not “make the claim

1 Attorney's arguments in a brief cannot take the place of evidence. In

indefinite" as appellant urges on page 3 of the request.’ As
pointed out on page 7 of our decision, “the plane of rotation
running along each face of the roller element [of Wright], for
example, is spaced laterally of the common horizontal axis,"

thereby meeting the above—noted limitation of claim 25.

2 Just because a claim is broad does not mean that it is indefinite.

Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, FLEMING and LALL, Administrative Patent Judges.

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
In a paper filed on April 26, 2001, bearing a Certificate of Mailing date of April 23,
2001, appellants request that we rehear our decision of February 23, 2001, in which we

affirmed and reversed the rejection of some claims under 35 U.S.C. § 102 and affirmed




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

and reversed some claims rejected under 35 U.S.C. §103. The request is thus filed in a
timely manner. In the request appellants set forth what amounts to three points alleging
misapprehension by us in our earlier opinion of certain features of the prior art as applied
only to independent claims 1, 15 and 24 on appeal, which are in the context only of the
rejection within 35 U.S.C. § 102.

As to the first point, appellants allege that we improperly interpreted what
constitutes a "chip site" in independent claims 1, 15 and 24. We do not see that
appellants have alleged any error at pages 2-4 of the request. We discussed chip sites in
various contexts at pages 6-9 of our original opinion even to the point of making reference
to appellants’ disclosure in the paragraph bridging pages 8 and 9 of our original opinion
as the term was originally used in the specification as filed.

Appellants’ reference to plural integrated circuit chips as discussed at page 3 of the
request is noted. Besides stating that Sommerfeldt is consistent with appellants’
consideration of what a chip site is, appellants make reference to their own specification
generally relating to a discussion of Multi-Chip Modules or MCMs. The discussion at

columns 1 and 2 of Sommerfeldt is consistent with this description of what an MCM is.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

Thus, Sommerfeldt clearly suggests there, if not its entire discussion and the portions we
outlined at pages 6-9 of our original opinion, that plural integrated circuit chips or plural
chips may be embodied on the top surface of the Figure 1 device 10 in Sommerleldt.

At the bottom of page 6 of our original decision, we stated that the "entire depiction
in Figure 2 [of Sommerfeldt] may comprise a so-called ‘chip site.’ We therefore agree with
the examiner's view expressed at the seventh page of the answer.“ There, the examiner
states that "any group of these pads can be called a chip site." It is appellants and not us
or the examiner at page 2 of the request that indicates that only two bonding pads may
constitute a chip site. Appellants‘ discussion in the remaining portion of the tirst alleged
error seems to be focused only upon a consideration of two bonding pads as a chip site.
The examiner seemed to be indicating that Sommerfe|dt’s chip sites may be located
anywhere. It appears that appellants have attempted to set up a redherring argument only
to shoot it down. We also indicated at the bottom of page 8 of our original opinion that
appellants‘ discussion of chip sites in the paragraph
bridging specification pages 7 and 8 should not be considered to be sites for receiving
complete integrated circuits or chips themselves since they are merely described there to

receive discrete semiconductor devices.




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

Appellants next assert at pages 4-6 of the request that we misapprehended
"whether Sommerfeldt accomplishes their wiring objectives on a single sublayer as
required by Appellants’ claims 1, 15 and 24." Appellants state at the top of page 5 that
"there is no teaching g disclosure in Sommerfeldt that one of the upper or lower planes
may be used to the exclusion of the other." Appellants invite us at the top of page 6 "to
particularly point out where in Sommerfeldt it is stated or disclosed that one of the upper Q
lower wiring planes may be used alone to connect wiring cells or route the conductive lines
across the interconnect device."

At the outset, we noted at page 6 of our original opinion that the respective planes
or layers 68 and 70 of representative Figure 8 and their corresponding layers in Figures 2,
3, and 6 may separately comprise an individual or single sublayer to the extent recited at
the end of each independent claim 1, 15 and 24 on appeal. We remain of this view. The

"comprising" nature of each independent claim 1, 15 and 24

on appeal does not exclude the fact that Sommerfeldt may require additional layers
beyond the planes or layers 68 and 70 of representative Figure 8. Sommerte|dt’s Figure 8

layers compare with appellants’ layers in Figure 1 as disclosed. Moreover, Sommerfeldt




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

states at lines 3-6 of the abstract that the "interconnect device is fully customizable or
programmable upon the upper surface to accommodate various electrical components
and connectivity to those components." A similar statement is made in Sommerfe|dt’s
Summary of the Invention at the bottom of column 2 at lines

64 and 65 which is that "the improved MCM hereof is not only fully programmable on only
the surface layer." We identified certain layers in Sommerfeldt as comprising the claimed
"single sublayer" in the last lines of each independent claim on appeal. These claims
require nothing more.

Finally, we turn our attention to the third point at pages 6 and 7 of the request.
There, appellants alleged that we misapprehended whether Sommerfeldt discloses the
inter pad limitation of independent claims 1, 15 and 24. The context in which we
discussed the inter pad spacing at the top of page 10 is the whole paragraph bridging
pages 9 and 10. The basic premise is that the bonding pads may be connected in any
manner in association with the use of connective links 58 shown in Figures 6 and 7. All of
this is caught up in the context of what we considered to be a chip site as discussed in this
paragraph. All that the claim requires is that a pair of connection pads at one chip site be

separated from the chip connection pads at another site by a space greater than any of the




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

inter pad spaces. Because Sommerfeldt indicates that his integrated circuit chips may be
mounted in various locations or "chip sites," the spacing between them implicitly is greater
than any space between the pads themselves at least to provide enough space between
the chip sites or the integrated circuit chips themselves.

Since we are unpersuaded that we misapprehended or overlooked appellants’
three enumerated points as set forth in the request for rehearing, we do not change our
views expressed in our February 23, 2001 opinion that the subject matter of independent
claims 1, 15 and 24 was anticipated by Sommerfeldt within 35 U.S.C.

§ 102.

ABRAMS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This case comes before us again on request for rehearing of our decision of
September 5, 2000, wherein we affirmed the decision of the examiner. The appellants
requested that we reconsider certain aspects of the reasoning which led to our conclusion
to affirm the examer's positions. We have done so and, for the reasons expressed below,

we have altered our decision. The Request for Rehearing is GRANTED.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3423 Page 2
Application No. 08/584,962

OPINION

The appellants’ invention relates to a folding combination tool. The following were
the rejections before us on appeal, all of them under 35 U.S.C. § 103:

(1) Claims 1-6, 12, 13 and 15-18 on the basis of Frazer in view of Newton.
(2) Claim 14 on the basis of Frazer in view of Newton and Pullman.

(3) Claims 1, 4-6, 12, 13 and 15-18 on the basis of Frazer in view of Schmidt.
(4) Claim 14 on the basis of Frazer in view of Schmidt and Pullman.

In our decision, we sustained all of the examiner's rejections, thereby affirming the
examiner's decision. A key tactor in each of the rejections was modification of the Frazer
combination tool by causing the handles to move in opposite directions between the
nested position and the deployed position, rather than in the same direction, as disclosed,
based upon the teachings of Newton or Schmidt. The appellants argue in the Request for
Rehearing (Request) that the Board erred in five respects, the second of which tocuses on
the propriety of this modification. The appellants pointed to passages in column 3 of
Frazer as support for their position that Frazer’s invention does not work unless the
handles fold in the same direction (Request, pages 6 and 7). While this point was raised
on page 6 ot the Appellants’ Brief, we have revisited this issue in the light of all of the
arguments presented in the Request, and now find ourselves in agreement with the
appellants’ position. Our reasoning follows.

Frazer discloses a combination hand tool with a pair of pliers jaws operated by

handles. A plurality of additional implements are pivotally stowed within each of the




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3423 Page 3
Application No. 08/584,962

handles. As illustrated in the drawings, the handles and the jaws are connected together
by pivots such that they are movable in the same direction with respect to one another
between a nested position and a deployed position (Figures 4-6). The pivot axes are
oriented at angles to each other, so that during the final phase ot rotation of the jaws into
the nested position (Figures 5 and 6), the handles are drawn together, causing them to
become interlocked by virtue of the interaction ot projections 19 on one handle with
notches 20 on the other. Owing to this arrangement of elements, an advantage is provided
when an additional implement, such as a knife blade, is deployed tor use from inside a
handle. As explained in column 3, in order to free an implement stowed in a handle for
use, the jaws are rotated to the deployed position (Figure 4), whereupon the handles
become spreadable and the implement can be moved to its operating position. The jaws
then are rotated to the nested position (Figure 7), at which point they become interlocked.
As explained in line 47 et seg.,

such interlocking allows a convenient working position for a pocket knife

implement. When the jaw members are projected from the handles, a

selected implement can be swung to its open position, whereupon the jaw

members can be swung to their nested or retracted position so as to

interlock the handles together. As shown in FIG. 7, the projected implement

9 will be in a projected working position with the interlocked side-by-side

handles forming a convenient grip allowing manipulation of the implement

without the danger of the implement closing on the hand of the user.

If the Frazer device were modified in the manner proposed by the examiner, that is, so that

the handles moved with respect to the jaws in opposite directions, it would appear that this




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3423 Page 4
Application No. 08/584,962

feature of the invention would be destroyed. Even acknowledging that it was known in the
art at the time of the appellants’ invention to fold the handles of this type of tool in opposite
directions to obtain other advantages, as explicitly is taught by Schmidt, the fact that the
proposed modification would nullify a basic feature of the Frazer invention would have
operated as a disincentive for one of ordinary skill in the art to do so.

Independent claims 1 and 16 each contain the requirement that the handles of the
device be rotatable in opposite directions between nested positions wherein they are
coplanar with the two jaws and adjacent thereto and deployed positions wherein they are
coplanar with the two jaws and remote therefrom. On the basis of the reasoning set forth
above, it is our view that the required suggestion to combine the references in such a
manner as to render the claimed subject matter obvious is lacking. This being the case, it
is our opinion that the combined teachings of Frazer and Newton, and Frazer and Schmidt,
fail to establish a grima facie case of obviousness with regard to the subject matter recited
in independent claims 1 and 16. We therefore will not sustain any of the rejections,
considering that Pullman, which was additionally cited against claim 14, fails to overcome
the deficiency in the other references.

QQNQLUSION

Our decision of September 5, 2000, hereby is modified in the following manner:

(1) None of the rejections are sustained.

(2) The decision of the examiner is reversed.

Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application O8/174,353

ON BRIEF

Before JERRY SMITH, RUGGIERO and BARRY, Administrative Patent
Judges.

JERRY SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request that we reconsider our decision of
January 14, 2002 wherein we sustained the rejection of claims 1,
3-6, 8-12, 14-16, 21, 23-28, 31, 33-35 and 37-40 as unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102 or 103.

We have reconsidered our decision of January 14, 2002 in
light of appellants’ comments in the request for rehearing, and

we find no errors therein. We, therefore, decline to make any




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application O8/174,353

changes in our prior decision for the reasons which follow.

A brief review of the prosecution of this appeal is
instructive. Appellants filed an appeal brief in which each of
the examiner's rejections was argued to some extent. The
examiner's answer in response to this appeal brief responded to
each of the arguments in the brief in a manner that was complete
and persuasive. Appellants filed a reply brief in which they
stated the following:

The Examiner's Answer clarifies the

Examiner's position in regard to many of the

rejections.

The Applicants’ primary position on Appeal is

that one skilled in the art would not have

been motivated to combine the disclosure of

Wilson with that of Brownstein and/or Hamada

et al. to achieve the present invention

[reply brief, page 1].
The reply brief did not address any of the specific responses
made by the examiner in the answer, but only addressed the
propriety of the combination of references used by the examiner.
The previous decision essentially affirmed the examiner's
rejections because appellants did not respond to the persuasive
arguments of the examiner set forth in the answer, and because we

agreed with the examiner that there was appropriate motivation to

combine the prior art teachings in the manner proposed by the




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application 08/174,353

examiner.

In the request for rehearing, appellants’ first point
asserts that the decision by the Board reflects a technical
misunderstanding of the prior art. Specifically, appellants
argue that Hamada corrects for shake on a real—time basis, and
therefore, does not use stored shake information for shake
correction. Appellants also argue that the portions of Wilson
and Hamada relied on in formulating the rejection are
inconsistent with each other [request, pages 1-4].

Appellants’ position improperly analyzes the obviousness
of physically combining Wilson's preferred embodiment with
Hamada’s preferred embodiment. Wilson was used as a teaching
that shake can be corrected at a later time by using previously
stored shake information. Wilson, however, does not describe the
nature of the shake correction. Hamada was cited for the sole
purpose of teaching that shake correction involves a comparison
between detected shake information and image information. Thus,
when the shake correction occurs at a later time as suggested by
Wilson, it would have been obvious to the artisan that this
correction would be achieved by performing a comparison as
suggested by Hamada. Therefore, we are not persuaded by this

particular argument that the previous decision was in error.




*** PAGE 4 ***





*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application O8/174,353

Appellants’ second point in the request is that the
previous decision ignores the significance of the still image
claim language. Specifically, appellants argue that Wilson
cannot be used with still images and Hamada does not teach shake
correction at a later time [request, pages 4-5].

In the original brief, appellants simply argued that the
applied prior art did not teach a reproducing apparatus in which
a still image is reproduced from a developed film and corrected
based on shake information of the still image. They supported
this argument by noting that Hamada corrected for shake before
the film was developed and Wilson corrected the video signal
during the buffering function [brief, pages 29-30]. The examiner
clearly responded to this argument [answer, pages 24-25].
Although appellants filed a reply brief as noted above, they
never addressed the examiner's response nor made any further
mention of the separate patentability based on a still image.

To the extent that this request asks that we change the
previous decision based on the fact that the claimed image is a
still image, we decline to do so. As noted in the previous
decision, we only considered those arguments actually made by
appellants in the brief. To the extent that appellants argued

the patentability of claims containing a recitation of still




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application O8/174,353

images in the original brief, the examiner persuasively responded
to these arguments as was evident in our previous decision.
Appellants are attempting to have new arguments considered in
this request for rehearing, and we will not consider arguments in
a rehearing which have not been first presented during
prosecution of the appeal before the examiner. Therefore, we are
not persuaded by this particular argument that the previous
decision was in error.

Appellants’ third point in the request is that there is
no motivation to combine the references. Specifically,
appellants argue that the Board failed to consider the requisite
legal requirements necessary for the combination of references
[request, pages 6-11].

To the extent that appellants raised issues of motivation
for the combination of references in the briefs, the examiner
responded to these issues in the answer and we responded to these
issues in the previous decision. For the most part, the request
for rehearing simply raises additional arguments which were not
presented in the briefs. As noted above, these are arguments
that appellants could have made and should have made while
prosecution was before the examiner. It is not appropriate for

us to consider arguments made for the first time in a request for




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application O8/174,353

rehearing. We have carefully reviewed the record in this appeal,
and we find that the questions regarding motivation to combine
were properly addressed by the examiner and by the Board.
Therefore, we are not persuaded by this particular argument that
the previous decision was in error.

Appellants’ fourth point in the request is that the
decision ignores In re Donaldson. Specifically, appellants argue
that the rejection of claim 1 be reconsidered in view of the
requirements of Donaldson, as requested in the original brief on
appeal. Appellants then analyze the relevant differences that
affect this analysis [request, pages 11-13].

We note that the original brief did raise the Donaldson
issue with respect to claim 1 only. The brief only raised the
question of whether the first and second recording means were
anticipated by Wilson under a Donaldson analysis [brief, pages
12-13]. The examiner responded to this argument by analyzing why
the corresponding elements of Wilson were equivalents to the
claimed first and second recording means [answer, page 15].
Although appellants filed a reply brief, they did not further
challenge the examiner's response with respect to the Donaldson

issue.




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application O8/174,353

In the previous decision, we noted that the examiner had
persuasively responded to each of appellants’ arguments with
respect to the rejection of claim 1 [previous decision, page 5].
We also stated the following:
Since we agree with each of the examiner's
assertions with respect to the disclosure of
Wilson as set forth in the response to
arguments section of the answer, and since
appellants have not persuasively challenged
these assertions, we agree with the examiner
that claims 1 and 3 are fully met by the
disclosure of Wilson [previous decision, page
7].

Thus, based on the record before us, we agreed with the

examiner's analysis of claim 1 based on the Donaldson issue.

The request for rehearing essentially seeks to change our
previous decision by asking us to look at a new record by making
several new arguments with respect to the Donaldson question. As
noted above, these are arguments that appellants could have made
and should have made while prosecution was before the examiner.
It is not appropriate for us to consider arguments made for the
first time in a request for rehearing. We have carefully
reviewed the record in this appeal, and we find that the
questions regarding Donaldson were properly addressed by the

examiner and by the Board. Therefore, we are not persuaded by

this particular argument that the previous decision was in error.




*** PAGE 9 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2687
Application O8/174,353

We have carefully considered the arguments raised by
appellants in their request for rehearing, but none of these
arguments are persuasive that the original decision was in error.
We are still of the view that the invention set forth in claims
1, 3-6, 8-12, 14-16, 21, 23-28, 31, 33-35 and 37-40 is not
patentable over the applied prior art based on the record
presented to us in the original appeal.

We have granted appellants’ request to the extent that we
have reconsidered our decision of January 14, 2002, but we deny

the request with respect to making any changes therein.

AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte SEAN P. HANSON

Appeal No. l999—2774
Application O8/794,337

ON BRIEF

Before MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, and
FRANKFORT and JENNIFER D. BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.

FRANKFORT, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING
This is in response to appellant's request for rehearing
of our decision mailed September 28, 2000, wherein we affirmed
the examiner's rejection of claims 1 through 6, l0 through 13,
22 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § lO3(a) as being unpatentable over

Kee in view of Law or Utterberg, and reversed the examiner's




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2774
Application O8/794,337

rejection of claims 7 through 9 and 14 through 21 under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) as being unpatentable over Kee in view of Law
or Utterberg considered further in view of either Oreopoulos

or Rugheimer.

In the request, appellant urges that our decision
regarding the combination of Utterberg with Kee as applied to
independent claims 1, 22 and 23 is based on a mistaken
interpretation of the structural characteristics of the Luer—
Lok joint seen in Utterberg. More specifically, in contrast
to our observations on page 8 of our earlier decision that
Utterberg discloses “a loose, freely rotatable mounting of the
sleeves once the connector is past the threaded portion of the
luer lock or the :angs of the retention device (34a),”
appellant argues :hat it is well known that such a Luer—Lok
joint operates by jamming the frustoconical sealing surfaces
of the joint toge:her to create a seal (as seen at 46 in Fig.
5B of Utterberg), and that rotation at the sealing interface
would be inconsis:ent with the proper functioning of a Luer—

Lok device. Having again reviewed the Utterberg reference in

light of appellan:’s points of argument, we must agree with

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. l999—2774
Application O8/794,337

appellant's position as presented in the Request for Rehearing
(pages 3-4). Accordingly, we modify our earlier opinion by
now reversing the examiner's rejection of claims 1 through 6,
10 through 13, 22 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § lO3(a) as being

unpatentable over Kee in view of Utterberg.

However, after having carefully considered each of the
points of argument raised by appellant in his Request for
Rehearing in relation to the combination of Kee and Law, we
remain of the view expressed in our earlier decision that
claims 1 through 6, 10 through 13, 22 and 23 would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art under 35 U.S.C. §
lO3(a) based on the collective teachings of Kee and Law.
Contrary to appellant's assertions on page 2 of the request,
the clevis
set forth in independent claims 1, 22 and 23 on appeal is not
required to be “a cylindrical element structured to capture
the tang," and nothing in the originally filed drawings or the
specification as originally filed requires that the clevis be
a cylindrical element, or requires that the clevis necessarily

provide “structural reinforcement completely around the tang

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2774
Application O8/794,337

circumference,” as urged on page 2 of the request. In this
regard, we direct appellant to our discussion of this issue on
pages 6 through 8 of our decision mailed September 28, 2000,
and again point out that the originally filed disclosure of
the application does not even use the terminology “tang,”

“clevis," or “tang and clevis connection.”

In further support of our determination in the decision
mailed September 28, 2000 regarding the combination of Kee and
Law, we observe that a “tang” is defined? as “a long and
slender
projecting strip, tongue, or prong forming part of an object,
such as a chisel, file, knife, etc., and serving as a means of
attachment for another part, as a handle or stock," while a
“clevis” is defined as “a U—shaped yoke at the end of a chain
or rod, between the ends of which a lever, hook, etc., can be
pinned or bolted." Thus, contrary to appellant's argument in
both the brief and this Request for Rehearing, a clevis would

ngt be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art as

English Language, Portland House, 1989.

*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. l999—2774
Application O8/794,337

requiring “a cylindrical element structured to capture a

n

tang, as argued, for example, on page 2 of this request and
would not necessarily be required to provide structural
reinforcement completely around a tang circumference, or be
required to carry transverse loading diametrically, from side-
to—side of a joint, through a continuous span of material

arranged in a hoop direction, as argued on pages 2 and 3 of

the request.

Looking at Law, Figures l—3, it remains our opinion that
the projecting portion (18, 40) of the conduit housing (12)
would have been viewed in its broadest reasonable
interpretation as constituting a “tang,” while the U—shaped
receiving portions defined by structures (42, 52, 60) of the
second conduit housing (20) would have been viewed as broadly

being a “clevis,"

and that the “tang and clevis connection”
formed when these components are brought together to define a
raintight and oiltight swivel connection is “capable of low
friction rotation while maintaining a fluid tight seal at the

interface between the first and second parts,” as set forth,

for example, in independent claim 1 on appeal. As a further

5




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. l999—2774
Application O8/794,337

point, we observe that in Figure 4 of Law the rotatable
connection between the conduit housings (ll2) and (120)
likewise provides a “tang and clevis connection” as broadly

set forth in claim l on appeal.

Moreover, even if we were to accept appellant's
assertions on pages 2 and 3 of the request concerning what
constitutes a “clevis,” we view the structure in Figure 4 of
Law to be responsive. In Figure 4 of Law the projecting
portion (ll8, ll9) of the conduit housing (ll2) would have
been viewed as broadly constituting a “tang,” while the U-
shaped receiving portion defined on the second conduit housing
(l20) would have been viewed as broadly being a “clevis.” In
this instance, the “clevis” includes (at annular channel 54) a
portion that is a
U—shaped, cylindrical element which provides structural
reinforcement completely around the tang circumference (at
ll9), but still provides for swivelling of the joint without
permitting unintended decoupling of the joint (col. 6, lines
l—8). In addition, the cylindrical portion of the “clevis” in

Figure 4 of Law would transfer transverse loads from one side

6




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2774
Application O8/794,337

to a diametrically opposite side of the joint through a
continuous span of material arranged in a hoop direction.
Thus, the structure in Law Figure 4 satisfies even appellant's

more restrictive understanding of what constitutes a “clevis."

In light of the foregoing, our affirmance of the
rejection of claims 1 through 6, 10 through 13, 22 and 23
under 35 U.S.C.
§ lO3(a) based on the collective teachings of Kee and Law set
forth in our decision mailed September 28, 2000 is maintained.
But our affirmance of the rejection of that same set of claims
based on Kee and Utterberg is now vacated and the examiner's
rejection of claims 1 through 6, 10 through 13, 22 and 23
under 35 U.S.C. § lO3(a) based on the collective teachings of

Kee and Utterberg is reversed.

As for appellant's comments in the request concerning the

7




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. l999—2774
Application 08/794,337

proposed drawing corrections submitted with the Request for
Rehearing, we leave consideration of such drawing corrections
and the drawing corrections filed on February 23, l998 to the
examiner, with the suggestion that the examiner carefully
review both of the proposed drawing corrections and the
amendments to page 8 of the specification (made in Paper Nos.

4 and 6) for any new matter.

Appellant's request for rehearing is granted to the
extent that we have modified our earlier decision by now
reversing the examiner's rejection of claims 1 through 6, l0
through l3, 22 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § l03(a) based on the
collective teachings of Kee and Utterberg, but, in our
opinion, no further change in our decision mailed September

28, 2000, is warranted.

Application 08/892,836

ORDER REMANDING TO EXAMINER

An Information Disclosure Statement (IDS) was filed July 5,
1997 (Paper No. 18). It is not apparent from the record that the
examiner properly considered the IDS submitted in accordance with
the criteria set forth in 37 CFR §§ 1.97 and 1.98.

Further, a first declaration (attached to Paper No. 11) and
a petition to change inventorship (Paper No. 14) were filed June
2, 1997. There is no indication in the record that either
submission has been considered by the examiner.

In addition, Amendment B filed June 2, 1997 (Paper No. 11)
was approved for entry by the examiner in his office action of

June 12, 1997 (Paper No. 13). The amendment remains unentered.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2000-0207

The copy of Claim 28 as submitted in Appellants’ Brief and
indicated by the examiner to be a correct copy does not appear to
agree with the claim presented by appellants in their amendment
filed on June 2, 1997 in Paper No. 11. The first two lines of
part (c) should read as follows: “c) a first uppermost cutting
level comprising superabrasive gains and successive uppermost

cutting levels among the plurality of cutting levels of each

Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that the application is remanded to the
Examiner for the following matters:

(1) consideration of the IDS (Paper No. 18) in accordance
with the pertinent rules;

(2) consideration of the Declaration (attached to
Paper No. ll);

(3) consideration of the petition to change inventorship
(Paper No. 14);

(4) appropriate entry of Amendment B (Paper No. ll);

ORDER VACATING REJECTION
AND REMANDING TO THE EXAMINER
Pursuant to 37 CFR § l.l96(a) and the Manual of Patent

Examining Procedure (MPEP) § l2ll, this application is remanded to
the examiner for appropriate action with respect to the matters
discussed below. Because the present rejection of the claims on
appeal is considered by us to be not appropriate and not ripe for

our review, we VACATE the rejection of the claims on appeal under




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

35 U.S.C. § 103 and remand the application in view of the following.
Essentially, we have concluded that the examiner has failed to
establish a prima facie case of obviousness as to any claim on
appeal.

Preliminarily, we note the following. The present application
contains a specification of over 130 pages with 67 drawing figures.
There are approximately 150 claims on appeal with 39 of these being
independent claims. The brief is approximately 200 pages long and
appears to argue each claim on appeal. The reply brief is 72 pages.
The examiner relies upon seven references to formulate a rejection
under 35 U.S.C. § 103, and the answer is over 20 pages.

At page 3 of the answer, the examiner sets forth the rejection
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 by relying upon all seven references together
to reject each claim on appeal. Beginning at this page of the
answer, the examiner has only briefly detailed some features of each
of the respective references relied upon. Initially, at least two
separate portions of Ito are discussed briefly. Since the examiner
considers this first reference as not explicitly disclosing a
certain feature, the examiner then relies upon a second, different
reference at page 4 of the answer. This practice is repeated again
by asserting that the primary reference does not disclose a

different feature and a tertiary reference is therefore found

2




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

obvious to combine with the initial reference to Ito. The statement
is made at the top of page 5 that the primary reference to Ito "as
modified" does not teach certain features, to which the examiner
relies upon two additional references, arguing their combinability
within 35 U.S.C. § 103. It is not clear to us in each instance in
which the examiner uses the term "Ito as modified," what the
examiner is referring to that has been previously recited since this
terminology is used in multiple locations. The examiner continues
with this approach until all of the seven references have been
considered together, each separately with Ito.

Beginning at page 6 of the answer, the examiner then considers
various combinations of the references relating to particular
independent claims. This appears to conflict with the examiner's
assertion at page 3 of the answer, which states that all claims are
rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being obvious in view of all seven
references relied on. Moreover, the assertions made with respect to
each of the seven references at pages 3-6 of the answer fail to set
forth any context or claimed feature of any identifiable claim on
appeal for which a specific reference is relied upon to meet. The
examiner's attempted correlation beginning at page 6 of the answer
to respective independent claims fails to assert what is taught in

any given reference with respect to what is claimed in any of these

3




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application O8/506,032

independent claims, what is not taught in the reference or
references relied on that is claimed, and then what is taught or
suggested with respect to each of the additional references relied
upon that is set forth in each of these independent claims. The
combinability of the references has not been stated with respect to
any feature claimed.

The examiner has essentially only set forth a broad—brush
approach to reject the claims on appeal. Stated differently, each
claim limitation of each independent claim on appeal has not been
respectively mapped to each of the reference's teachings and/or
showings in the drawings in a detailed manner. Thus, the examiner
has not fully explained the rationale for the rejection under
35 U.S.C. § 103 for each of the independent claims on appeal.
Following this approach, it is apparent to us that the examiner has
not set forth a prima facie case of obviousness for each of the
independent claims on appeal.

At page 7 of the answer the examiner makes reference to the
dependent claims indicating "they are also rejected for the same
reasons as set forth in the rejection above." There is no detailed
discussion of the features recited in each of the noted dependent
claims with respect to any of the references relied upon as a basis

to reject them. Moreover, the examiner has stated at page 8 of the




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

answer that "[s]ince appellant has [sic, an] unreasonable number of
claims in the file, it is a burden on the examiner to address all
single claims, but the examiner has attempted to address all the
independent claims." The examiner's "attempt" to address all the
independent claims has, as noted above, been found to not set forth
a prima facie case of obviousness within 35 U.S.C. § l03.
Similarly, it is apparent that, because of the number of claims on
appeal, the examiner has not addressed all the dependent claims
because "it is a burden on the examiner to address all single
claims." We therefore conclude that the examiner has failed to set
forth a prima facie case of obviousness as to all the dependent
claims on appeal as well.
The examiner is free to reinstitute any rejections under

35 U.S.C. § l03 on the basis of the presently applied or any new,
different prior art. In any event, for each reference relied on

in each rejection, the PTO's policy is for the examiner to

compare the rejected claims feature—by—feature or limitation—by—
limitation with each of the references relied upon in the
rejection. This comparison should map the language of the claims
to the specific page number, column number, line number, drawing

number, drawing reference number, and/or quotation from each




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

reference relied upon. Note MPEP § 706.02(j) and MPEP § 1208 for
the correct methodologies.

It is not the Board's burden or the burden of any panel of
this Board to initially assert and to even formulate the details
of a prima facie case of obviousness within 35 U.S.C. 103. This

burden of proof rests solely upon the examiner. Note, e.g.,

In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed.
Cir. 1992).

The examiner may choose to first avail himself or herself of
the provisions of 37 CFR § 1.75(b) and the discussion thereof
within MPEP § 2173.05(n) as to the examiner's characterization at
page 8 of the answer that there are an "unreasonable number of
claims in the file." As noted in subsection (b) of 37 CFR
§ 1.75, the claims must differ substantially from each other AND
not be unduly multiplied. To the extent the examiner may
determine that the claims do not differ substantially from each
other, then they are in inherently unduly multiplied and not in
compliance with this rule. The analysis as to this rule proceeds
by first comparing each independent claim for relative compliance
with this rule, then to a corresponding comparison of the

dependent claims.




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

In summary, the present rejection of all claims on appeal
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 is VACATED. Additionally, this application
is remanded to the examiner for further action consistent with
the foregoing.

VACATUR AND REMAND TO EXAMINER

Having considered the record and listening to oral argument, we conclude that
this case is not in condition for a decision on appeal. Accordingly, we vacate the
examiner’s rejection and remand the application for the examiner to take appropriate
action.

Claim 3 is representative of the subject matter on appeal reads as follows:

3. Process for the isolation in aqueous phase of a nucleic material present in a
sample by adsorption of said nucleic material onto a particulate support, comprising:




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0499 Page 2
Application No. 08/945,731

(a) providing an adsorption reagent comprising a sol consisting of an aqueous
continuous phase and a discontinuous phase of the particulate support, which
comprises a functionalized, particulate polymer, said polymer being obtained by
polymerization of (1) a first water-soluble monomer of acrylamide or of an acrylamide
derivative, (2) at least one cross-linking agent and (3) at least a second cationic and
water-soluble functional monomer, said polymer having a predetermined lower critical
solubility temperature (LCST) which is between 25 and 45 C,

(b) bringing into contact the adsorption reagent with the sample containing the
nucleic material to absorb the nucleic material to the particulate support,

wherein, in said contacting step (b), the reaction medium has:

- an ionic strength at most equal to 10 '2 M,

- a pH at most equal to 7, and

- a temperature less than the LCST of the polymer,

(c) optionally observing that the adsorption has taken place, and

(d) separating the discontinuous phase from the continuous phase.

The references relied upon by the examiner are:

Hoffman et al. (Hoffman) 5,912,032 Mar. 27, 1990
Kausch et al. (Kausch) 5,508,164 Apr. 16, 1996
Kawaguchi et al. (Kawaguchi) 5,122,600 Jun. 16, 1992
Itoh et al. (ltoh) EP 161,881 Nov. 21, 1985

Claims 1 through 3 and 5 through 23 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
As evidence of obviousness, the examiner relies upon ltoh, Hoffman, Kausch, and
Kawaguchi.

VACATUR

We begin with the proposition that this board serves as a board of review, not as
a deg examination tribunal. 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). Review of the examiner's position in
this appeal is difficult since the examiner has not applied the teachings of the cited prior
art against the requirements of any individual claim on appeal.

At page 4 of the Examiner's Answer, the examiner refers the reader to Paper No.

10 for a statement of the rejection. Paper No. 10 is an Advisory Action entered on




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0499 Page 3
Application No. 08/945,731
November 10, 1999. Therein, the examiner explains why the claims pending at that
time were considered to be unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) on the basis of Itoh,
Hoffman, Kausch, and Kawaguchi. The explanation is unusual in that it is a blend of a
statement of a rejection and an answer to arguments. Be that as it may, the explanation
is difficult to review since the examiner does not refer to any individual claim on appeal
but, rather, couches the explanation in terms of “the claims" or “the instant invention."
As a result, we have a very general statement as to what purportedly would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art but not a specific statement as to why claim 3,
the broadest claim pending, would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.

While the examiner does point to specific disclosures of the four documents in
the explanation, at crucial points in the examiner's analysis we are left with sunnise and
conjecture. For example, the examiner states in the paragraph bridging pages 4-5 of
Paper No. 10:
A further reading of Itoh et al. at page 47, lines 6-24 reveals a teaching of
the general mechanism of action of the polymer. Stating that high molecular
weight substances are retained at low temperatures and released at high
temperatures. While Itoh et al. did not contemplate nucleic acids to be treated in
this manner, it is clear that an understanding of the general mechanism of action
of the polymer is sufficient to teach one of skill in the art how to use the polymer.
Another example appears at page 5 of Paper No. 10 where the examiner states that
“the general teachings of ltoh  are sufficient to teach one of skill in the art how to use
the polymer 

The vagueness and lack of speciﬁcity of the examiner's position is perhaps

pointed up most succinctly in the paragraph bridging pages 6-7 of Paper No. 10 which

reads as follows:




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0499 Page 4
Applition No. 08/945,731

It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
the instant invention to combine the teachings of Itoh et al., Hoffman et al.,

Kawaguchi et al. and Kausch et al. to produce the instant invention because Itoh
et al., Hoffman et al., Kawaguchi et al. and Kausch et al. were all using
acrylamide polymers with a copolymer which would adsorb and desorb nucleic
acids and proteins. Itoh et al. taught the use of the acrylamide polymer in bead
form, and coated onto solid supports. Hoffman et al. taught the adsorption of
nucleic acid in a low ionic strength buffer and the desorption of the nucleic acid in
a high ionic strength buffer. Kawaguchi et al. and Kausch et al. taught the
coating of polyacrylamide onto solid bead supports, and Kausch et al. taught the
polyacrylamide coated beads which comprised a magnetic compound to facilitate
the isolation of the bead with the bound DNA in a magnetic field.
That paragraph begs the question what is the “instant invention?" Patentability is
determined based upon the individual claims pending in an application, not an
“invention." In other words, examiners do not examine the “invention” to detennine
whether an applicant is entitled to a patent under Title 35 of the United States Code.
Rather, the examination is based on the individual claims appearing in the patent
application. The lack of specificity in the examiner's statement is also highlighted in this
paragraph in that Kawaguchi and Kausch are relied upon to teach coating of
polyacrylamide onto solid bead supports and polyacrylamide coated beads comprised
of a magnetic compound respectively. Neither of these requirements is found in claim 3

on appeal.

An example of an unsupported assertion made by the examiner is found at page
4 of Paper No. 10 where the examiner states:

While Itoh et al. did not specifically teach the use of a low ionic strength
binding buffer nor the increased ionic strength of an eluting buffer, one of
ordinary skill in the art would know that the use of an affinity matrix would require
the use of elements such as a low ionic strength binding buffer and an increased
ionic strength buffer to elute the bound nucleic material.




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0499 Page 5
Application No. 08/945,731
Another example appears in the paragraph bridging pages 4-5 of Paper No. 10 as

follows:

A further reading of Itoh et al. at page 47, lines 6-24 reveals a teaching of
the general mechanism of action of the polymer. Stating that high molecular
weight substances are retained at low temperatures and released at high
temperatures. While Itoh et al. did not contemplate nucleic acids to be treated in
this manner, it is clear that an understanding of the general mechanism of action
of the polymer is sufficient to teach one of skill in the art how to use the polymer.
It is clear from reading ltoh that it is relevant in determining the patentability of

claim 3 on appeal. However, in critical passages, ltoh contradicts or is opposite that
which is required by claim 3 on appeal. For example, claim 3 requires that the nucleic
material be absorbed at a lower temperature and be released at a higher temperature.
In the one mention of nucleic acids in ltoh, the reference states that “these compounds
may be held at high temperatures and released at low temperatures.” ltoh, page 44,
line 13- page 45, line 13. However, as observed by examiner and appellants, ltoh goes
on to smte at page 47, lines 19-24 that:

Where materials, which are to be released, are held in gel-like polymers,
they are held at low temperatures as the gel-like polymers are swollen at the low
temperatures and are released at high temperatures as the gel-like polymers are
shrunk at the high temperatures.

It may be that a person of ordinary skill in this art reading ltoh in its entirety would
reasonably conclude that regardless of the other teachings in the document, when gel-
like polymers are used according to that invention, they absorb at a low temperature
and release at a high temperature similar to the polymer sol required by claim 3 on
appeal. If so, then one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the speciﬁc

teaching in regard to absorption and release of nucleic acids at page 45 of the

document, which is opposite that required by claim 3 on appeal would apply only when




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0499 Page 6
Application No. 08/945,731

non—gel-like polymers are used in ltoh. We do not have such a ﬁnding from the
examiner.

As a final example of the difficulty of reviewing the examiner's position, we point
to the claim requirement that the polymer contain a second, cationic monomer. The
examiner states at page 8 of Paper No. 10 that ltoh teaches the use of cationic
monomers at page 24, lines 11-21. However, that passage of ltoh is directed to
homopolymers and copolymers which contain carboxylic acid groups. It is not readily
seen how those polymers would be considered cationic. However, that is not to say
Itoh does not specifically address the issue. ltoh states at page 50 that a “more
selective holding and release" n occur if an ionic monomer, such as a cationic
monmer is is used in the polymer. If nucleic acids are anionic in nature, this latter
passage from ltoh may supply the requisite reason, suggestion, or motivation to use a
cationic, gel copolymer as othenrvise described in ltoh to separate nucleic acids by
absorbing at a low temperature and releasing at a high temperature. Again, we do not

have such findings and conclusions from the examiner.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviews board decisions. 35 U.S.C.

§ 144. The court discussed their statutory duty of review in Gechter v. Davidson, 116
F.3d 1454, 43 USPQ2d 1030 (Fed. Cir. 1997). In considering the issue, the court

stated “the statute's mandate to ‘review’ implies inherent power in this court to require

that the Board's decision be capable of review.” ld_., F.3d at 1457, 43 USPQ2d at 1033.

The court observed “Necessary ﬁndings must be expressed with sufficient particularity
to enable our court, without resort to speculation, to understand the reasoning of the

Board, and to determine whether it applied the law correctly and whether the evidence




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0499 Page 7
Application No. 08/945,731

supported the underlying and ultimate fact findings." |d_. What the Federal Circuit
rightfully expects from the Board, the Board expects from the examiner.

Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to vacate the rejection and return
the case to the jurisdiction of the examiner to reconsider the patentability of the claims.

REMAND

Upon return of the application the examiner should take a step back and
reassess the patentability of the claims. The reassessment should take place on a
claim-by-claim basis beginning with claim 3. If the examiner believes that claim 3 is
unpatentable on the basis of ltoh and/or other relevant prior art, he should state the
facts and reasons used in support with particularity.

There is other evidence of record which may be relevant in putting ltoh in proper
factual context to the extent it describes the separation of nucleic material. We refer to
European Patent Application No. 0 501 301 A2, Mori, of record. Mori describes an
electrophoretic gel comprising at least one cross-linked temperature-responsive
polymeric compound having an LCST used to separate nucleic acids. As described by
Mori, the acrylamide based ge_|s of that reference are used to absorb nucleic acids at
low temperatures and release the absorbed material at high temperatures. See, e.g.,
column 6, lines 31-54. This information may provide evidence that |toh's disclosure that
gel polymers absorb at a low temperature and release at a high temperature does apply
to nucleic acids and thus provides an answer to appellants’ argument that ltoh is to be
read restrictively as only teaching absorbing nucleic acids at high temperature and

releasing at low temperatures.




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 2001-0499 Page 8
Application No. 08/945,731

To the extent ltoh and other relevant references teach that absorption and
release of valuable substances using LCST polymers depends on temperature, pH and
ionic strength‘ but do not specifically teach the specific parameters required by the
claims on appeal, the examiner should determine if such parameters are result effective
variables. If so, optimization of such values may have been obvious. In re Boesch, 617
F.2d 272, 276, 205 USPQ 215, 219 (CCPA 1980).

Judges.

MCQUADE, Administrative Patent Judge.

REMAND TO THE EXAMINER

The instant application has been forwarded to this Board by
the examiner for a decision on appeal. Because the record before
us raises a serious question as to whether we have jurisdiction
to hear an appeal at this point, we remand the application to the
examiner under the authority of 37 CFR § l.l96(a) and MPEP § 1211
for resolution of this and other matters.

The record shows the following with regard to our areas of

COHCEIH .




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2001-2305
Application 08/669,674

I. On August 31, 1999, this Board rendered a decision (Paper
No. 16) in an earlier appeal (Appeal No. 99-0103) involving the
application. The decision sustained the examiner's 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) rejection of claim 1, the sole claim pending in the
application, as being unpatentable over U.S. Patent No. 4,760,510
to Lahti.

II. In response to the decision, the appellants ultimately
filed a request for a continued prosecution application (Paper
No. 23). The request did not include any amendment of the
application.

III. In an Office action dated August 15, 2000 (Paper No.
25), the examiner found the request for a continued prosecution
application to be acceptable, rejected claim 1 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 112, second paragraph, as being indefinite and under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as being unpatentable over Lahti, and made the Office
action final.1

IV. After filing what amounted to a request for
reconsideration (Paper No. 26) which the examiner viewed to be

unpersuasive (see Paper No. 27), the appellants submitted an

1 Given the inclusion of the new 35 U.S.C. § 112, second
paragraph, rejection, the finality of the Office action clearly
was premature. See MPEP §§ 706.07(a) and 706.07(b).

appeal brief (Paper No. 28) on November 13, 2000. Upon being
notified by the examiner that the brief was not acceptable
because the statutory fee for filing the brief had not been
submitted (see Paper No. 29), the appellants submitted the
requisite fee on December 5, 2000 (see Paper No. 30). The record
does not show that the appellants filed a petition and fee for an
extension of time to accommodate the delay in paying the appeal
brief fee.

V. On February 13, 2001, the examiner issued an examiner's
answer (Paper No. 31) in response to the appellants’ brief.

VI. On March 23, 2001, the appellants submitted a letter
(Paper No. 32) which the examiner characterized as a reply brief
and noted (see Paper No. 33) before forwarding the application to
this Board.

The record does not indicate that the appellants ever filed,
in connection with the current appeal proceedings, a notice of
appeal pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.191(a) or the corresponding
statutory fee required by 35 U.s.C. § 41(a)(6)(A). This apparent
lapse arguably renders the application abandoned, which of course
would deprive us of any jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The
examiner is directed to take appropriate action to resolve this

matter in accordance with the relevant statutes and regulations.




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 2001-2305
Application 08/669,674

Our review also shows (1) that the explanations of the 35
U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, rejection in the final rejection
(Paper No. 25) and examiner's answer (Paper No. 31) do not
address with any reasonable specificity the limitations recited
in the claim, and (2) that the appellants’ briefs, perhaps
understandably, do not contain any reasonably specific argument
of this rejection. As a result, the issues pertaining to the
rejection have not been developed to the extent necessary for a
reasoned consideration on appeal. In the event the appeal is
eventually perfected from a procedural standpoint, the examiner
is further directed to take appropriate action to rectify this
deficiency.

Additionally, the nature of the examiner's remarks in the
answer explaining the 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, and 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) rejections and the copy of the “claim involved in
[the] appeal” in the appendix section of the appellants’ brief
causes us to question whether the examiner and/or the appellants
are focusing on the version of claim 1 officially entered into
the record, i.e., claim 1 as submitted on December 22, 1997 in

Paper No. 5.2 The examiner is directed to take appropriate

action to ensure that the officially entered version of the claim
is addressed in any further proceedings on appeal.

Finally, given their pgg sg status and obvious unfamiliarity
with patent prosecution practice, the appellants may wish to
consider contacting the USPTO’s Office of Independent Inventor
Programs at (703) 306-5568 for answers to procedural questions
relating to the prosecution of their application.

Subsequently, appellants filed an Appeal Brief on
December 28, 2000 (Paper No. 17). According to the Examiner's

However, a review of the Appendix to the Brief reveals that

claim 1 is not the correct copy according to the amendments filed
on August 8, 1999 (Paper No. 10) and November 26, 1999 (Paper

No. 12). Claim, lines 7 and 8, contains substantial errors as
follows:

Line 7: After data, enter "——which has already been
transmitted, after——."

Line 7: Delete "——when——."

Line 7: Delete "different" and replace with
"——requested——."

Line 7: After "information" add "——, which is different
from said advertising data——."

Lige_8: After "out" add "——during a time when the requested
information is being transmitted, this time being different from
said communication idle time and——."

Accordingly, it is

ORDERED that the application is remanded to the
examiner for notifying appellants to submit a corrected Appendix
to the Brief, or for the examiner to submit a correct copy of
claim 1 on appeal, and for such further action as may be
appropriate.

It is important that the Board of Patent Appeals and
Interferences be informed promptly of any action affecting the

status of the appeal (i.e., abandonment, issue, reopening

prosecution).

Appeal No. 2002-0780
Application No. 09/128,340

ON BRIEF

Before, ADAMS, MILLS and GREEN, Administrative Patent Judges.

ADAMS, Administrative Patent Judge.
VACATUR and REMAND TO THE EXAMINER

On consideration of the record we find this case is not in condition for a
decision on appeal. For the reasons that follow, we vacate‘ the pending rejection
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 and remand the application to the examiner to consider

the tollowing issues and to take appropriate action.

I Lest there be any misunderstanding, the term “vacate” in this context means to set aside or to
void. When the Board vacates an examiner's rejection, the rejection is set aside and no longer

exists. Ex Qarte Zambrano, 53 USPQ2d 1312, 1313 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2001).

Claims 1 and 8 are illustrative of the subject matter on appeal and are
reproduced below:
1. A method for disrupting cells comprising:
providing a sonic bath comprising a first liquid;
placing into said first liquid a vessel comprising cells in a second
liquid at an alkaline pH; and
subjecting said cells to ultrasonic energy from said sonic bath of

sufficient power and duration to cause disruption of said cells in the
absence of beads.

8. A method for disrupting cells by applying ultrasonic energy to a sample
of cells in a first liquid, wherein the surface tension of said first liquid is
reduced.

The references relied upon by the examiner are:

The reference relied upon by appellant is:

Murphy et al. (Murphy) 5,374,522 Dec. 20, 1994
GROUND OF REJECTION

Claims 1 and 3-13 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as unpatentable

over Buck in view of Robson and Robbins.

DISCUSSION

Buck:

According to the examiner (Answer, page 4), Buck teaches “a method for
disrupting Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells using ultrasonic energy without

beads" by “providing a sonic bath comprising a first liquid (i.e.[,] dish of water




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2002-0780 Page 3
Application No. 09/128,340

next to a sonicator probe), and placing into the first liquid a vessel comprising
cells in a second liquid (i.e.[,] tubes containing the cells within another liquid,
such as residual water or buffer solution or detergent solution).” In addition, the
examiner finds that Buck teaches the “use of a liquid having an alkaline pH (i.e.[,]
pH 8.3) for disrupting cells..." and describe well know surfactants “Triton X-100
and Tween to be useful for cell disruption."

As we understand the reference, Buck was interested in identifying a
methodology for isolating DNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis for amplification
by the polymerase chain reaction. E Title and Abstract. Buck studied four
separate methods; (1) treatment with proteinase K and nonionic detergents, (2)
boiling with nonionic detergents, (3) freezing and thawing and (4) sonication. For
the sonication method, Buck teaches (bridging sentence, pages 1331-1332),
“tubes [containing cells suspended in distilled water] were placed in a plastic rack
that was floated in a dish of water next to the sonicator probe  and sonicated
for 30 min at 45 W." While the Buck refers to a PCR buffer comprising “a liquid
having an alkaline pH," “Triton X-100 and Tween,” this PCR buffer was used in
methods (1)-(3) above, and was not used in the sonication method taught by
Buck. Buck concludes (page 1333, column 1):

Our results confirm that these simplified methods [(1)-(3) above]

are capable of releasing DNA for amplification but suggest that

these methods are relatively ineffective, since the sensitivity of

detection was only down to about 103 organisms.

The sonication procedure, on the other hand, was capable of
detecting as few as 10 to 100 organisms. It appears that enough

ultrasonic energy is transmitted through the walls of the
microcentrifuge tubes to effectively disrupt the mycobacteria.

Appeal No. 2002-0780 Page 4
Application No. 09/128,340

Be:

The examiner finds (Q, page 4), Robson teaches “disrupting
Mycobacteria [sic] cells using sonication, with and without glass beads, and heat
at 60°C...." In addition, the examiner finds (id_.), Robson teaches “cells to be
lysed can be in water, but also can be in suitable buffers having alkaline pH
(i.e.[,] Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, pH|] 8.8, etc.).”

As we understand the reference, Robson discloses a ‘process for lysing
mycobacteria  comprising exposing the bacteria to a lysis effective amount of
heat." E Abstract. According to Robson, liberated “DNA is suited for
subsequent analysis by way of probe hybridization, restriction enzyme analysis,
and the like.'’ Q Robson discloses (column 1, lines 59-62), “[t]he process of the
invention is particularly advantageous since only one step is involved, it is
expedient compared to prior processes, and little instrumentation is necessary."
By way of seven examples, Robson distinguishes sonication from their heat lysis
methodology. In examples 2 and 4 (columns 7-9), Robson discloses the
sonication ot Mycobacteria tuberculosis with or without glass beads. In each of
these examples no, or an insufficient amount of, DNA was released from the
cells. In example 5 (column 9), Robson discloses a sonication method with a
“GEN-PROBE lysing tube." Robson, however, report (id_., at lines 38-41), “[w]hi|e
Gen-Probe was successful, two extra phenol/chloroform extractions were

required to clear the sample (i.e.[,] remove contaminants from the lysis solution)

before it was subjected to ana|ysis"2. In contrast, Robson discloses in examples
1, 6 and 7 (columns 8, 9 and 10) that their heat treatment methodology released
sufficient amounts of DNA.
ii

The examiner finds (Answer, page 5), Robbins teaches “a method for
disrupting cells using ultrasonic energy (i.e.[,] sonic disintegration) and adjusting
the disrupted cells at an alkaline pH between 8 and 11, and a temperature of 4°C
[sic] to 60

As we understand this reference, Robbins discloses a yeast protein isolate
with reduced nucleic acid content and a process of preparing the isolate. E
Title and Abstract. While the examiner recognizes that Robbins disrupt cells at
“an alkaline pH between 8 and 11" the method of disruption was not by
sonication but was instead by homogenization. E column 3, lines 28-47 (“[t]he
presently preferred method is homogenization  in our process the homogenate
is adjusted to a pH of above 5.5 preferably between 8 and 11 Furthermore,
in contrast to the methods of Buck and Robson which were interested disrupting
Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells for DNA analysis, for Robbins among “[t]he
most important factor[s] is to rupture a majority of the [yeast] cells under
conditions such that (1) the endogenous nuclease is not destroyed...." Column
3, lines 25-27. Robbins intended to preserve the activity of the endogenous

nuclease activity, because a “principal object [of their invention] is to provide a

nor do they identify the power setting of the sonicator used.

process of making a yeast protein isolate in which endogenous nuclease is used
to hydrolyze the nucleic acid so that the nucleic acid fragments can be separated
from the protein by precipitation of the protein.” Robbins, column 2, lines 40-44.
To produce a protein isolate with reduced nucleic acid content, Robbins discloses
(column 4, lines 3-5), the “incubation of the endogenous nuclease is done at
40°C to 60°C...."

Based on the forgoing analysis ot the references of record, we make the
following observations.

1. Is Robbins properly combined with Buck and Robson?

As discussed above, it appears that Robbins was interested in hydrolyzing
nucleic acid from yeast to produce a yeast protein isolate with reduced nucleic
acid content. In contrast, Robson and Buck were interested in disrupting
Mycobacteria tuberculosis in order to analyze nucleic acid. It would seem that
Robbins’ method ot hydrolyzing nucleic acid would be inconsistent with the
methods of Robson and Buck.

Furthermore, the examiner relies on Robbins to teach, “adjusting the
disrupted cells at an alkaline pH between 8 and 1 1  Answer, page 5. We
emphasize however, that contrary to appellants’ claim 1 which requires the cells
to be in a liquid at an alkaline pH prior to disruption, Robbins adjust the pH of the
homogenate (the material after disruption of the cells). According to Robbins

(column 3, lines 28-32), the yeast cells are homogenized at a pH of 4.5-6.5.




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 2002-0780 Page 7
Application No. 09/128,340

In addition, the examiner relies on Robbins to teach "a temperature of 4°C
to 60°C (col. 3, lines 18-55).” Answer, page 5. We are unable to identify this
temperature range at the section cited by the examiner. Instead, at column 4,
lines 3-5, Robbins teaches “[t]he incubation of the endogenous nuclease is done
at 40°C to 60°C., a pH of 5 to 8, and for a time of 15 to 120 minutes.” As
discussed above, this incubation is to hydrolyze nucleic acid present in the
preparation, and is therefore inconsistent with the Robson and Buck references.
Furthermore, we fail to see the nexus between the recited temperature used for
the enzymatic hydrolysis of nucleic acid and the sonication temperature set forth
in appellants’ claimed invention.

Upon return of the application, the examiner should take a step back and
reevaluate whether the references can be properly combined. If the examiner
finds that the rejection should be maintained, the examiner should issue an
appropriate Office action setting forth such a rejection, using the proper legal
standards and clearly explaining the facts relied upon in support of such a
rejection.

2. Does Robson teach away from the claimed invention?

In determining whether the claimed invention is obvious, a prior art
reference must be read as a whole and consideration must be given where the
reference teaches away from the claimed invention. Akzo N.V., Aramide

Maatschagpi v.o.f. v. United States lnt’l Trade Comm’n, 808 F.2d 1471, 1481, 1
USPQ2d 1241, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1986).




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 2002-0780 Page 8
Application No. 09/128,340

As discussed above, Robson exemplifies several sonication methods that
were unable, or required additional purification steps to produce a beneficial
result. In contrast to the sonication methods exemplified, Robson exemplifies a
single step heat lysis of Mycobacteria tuberculosis that “is particularly
advantageous since only one step is involved, it is expedient compared to prior
processes, and little instrumentation is necessary." Robson, column 1, lines 59-
62. Therefore, it appears that Robson, directs a person of ordinary skill in the art
away from sonication methods and toward a method of heat lysis of
Mycobacteria tuberculosis.

Upon return of the application, the examiner should take a step back and
reevaluate whether the Robson reference in its entirety. If the examiner finds
that the rejection should be maintained, the examiner should issue an
appropriate Office action setting forth such a rejection, using the proper legal
standards and clearly explaining the facts relied upon in support of such a
rejection.

3. Surface tension and Buffers.

Appellants‘ claim 5 further modifies claim 1 by requiring that “the surface
tension of said second liquid is reduced.” According to the examiner (Answer,
pages 5-6):

[T]he art clearly recognizes the means by which surface tension of

liquids may be reduced. Surface tension is reduced by the addition

of surfactants. The judicious selection of a surfactant can change

the pH conditions of any liquid. This is well known to those of
ordinary skill in the art.




*** PAGE 9 ***


Appeal No. 2002-0780 Page 9
Application No. 09/128,340

Also since surfactants are well known in the art to reduce

surface tension, the reduced surface tension of the liquid containing

the cells is the result expected of a liquid containing a surfactant.

Thus, the reduced surface tension of the liquid is merely an

expected successful result. Because this result is obtained by an

obvious modification of the prior art, the reduction in surface

tension of the liquid is obvious.

The purpose of this cryptic discussion on surface tension is unclear. It may be
that the examiner’s statement implies a reference back to her statement (Answer,
page 4), "Buck describes Triton X-100 and Tween to be useful for cell disruption.
These are well known surfactants in the art." The buffer solutions of Buck,
however, were not used in Buck’s sonication method. Instead, the cells in Buck's
sonication method were suspended in distilled water. Similarity, Robson
discloses the use of buffer solutions for their heat lysis method‘’, but use water in
the sonication methods exemplified.

Therefore, while buffer solutions containing detergents such as Tween 20
are mentioned in Buck and Robson we are unable to identify any suggestion to
use these solutions in a method of sonication. While a person of ordinary skill in
the art may possess the requisite knowledge and ability to modify the protocol
taught by the prior art, the modification is not obvious unless the prior art
suggested the desirability of the modification. In re Gordon, 733 F.2d 900, 902,
211 USPQ 1125, 1127 (Fed. Cir. 1984). On this record the examiner identified

detergents and buffers in the prior art relied upon but has failed to provide any

3 Robson, column 6, lines 26-30 (“[i]n the most basic embodiment of the invention a sample 
containing the intracellular oomponents desired is heated to obtain readily useable components.
The organism to be lysed can be in H20, but also can be in suitable buffers...and detergents
such as 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.5% Nonident P-40.”).




*** PAGE 10 ***


Appeal No. 2002-0780 Page 10
Application No. 09/128,340

explanation as to why a person of ordinary skill in the art would have modified the
sonication methods taught by the prior art to include a buffer or detergent.

Upon return of the application, the examiner should take a step back and
reevaluate the prior art relied upon. If the examiner finds that the rejection
should be made, the examiner should issue an appropriate Office action setting
forth such a rejection, using the proper legal standards and clearly explaining the
facts relied upon in support of such a rejection.

4. Does Robson teach Mycobacteria tuberculosis is heat resistant?

According to the examiner (Answer, page 7), Mycobacteria tuberculosis "is
taught by Robson to be heat resistant (cols. 1-2, all lines)." It appears that the
examiner has misapprehended the Robson reference. Contrary to the
examiner's statement Robson discloses (column 2, lines 13-22) (emphasis
added):

The heating of Mycobacteria for lysis is advantageous over known

methods for lysis of Mycobacteria which involve the use of caustic

chemicals, time consuming culturing, and mechanical methods

which use the French press, the Hughes press, sonicating probes,

bath sonicators, freeze-thawing, glass beads, the Ribi pressure cell,

and the like (see Table 1).

Upon return of the application, the examiner should take a step back and
reevaluate the prior art relied upon, paying careful attention to exactly what the
reference teaches. If the examiner finds that the rejection should be made, the
examiner should issue an appropriate Otfice action setting forth such a rejection,

using the proper legal standards and clearly explaining the facts relied upon in

support of such a rejection.




*** PAGE 11 ***


Appeal No. 2002-0780 Page 11
Application No. 09/128,340

For the foregoing reasons, it is our opinion that the examiner did not
consider the references relied upon for what they fairly teach a person of ordinary
skill in the art. Accordingly, we vacate the pending rejection and remand the
application to the examiner for further consideration. We urge the examiner to
take this opportunity to reconsider the prosecution history together with the
available prior art. If after a renewed consideration of the facts and evidence, the
examiner believes that a prior art rejection should be made, the examiner should
issue an appropriate Office action setting forth such a rejection, using the proper
legal standards and clearly explaining the facts relied upon in support of such a
rejection.

We are n_ot authorizing a Supplemental Examiner's Answer under
the provisions of 37 CFR § 1.193(b)(1). Any further communication from
the examiner which contains a rejection of the claims should provide

appellants with a full and fair opportunity to respond.

Per curiam.

REMAND TO THE EXAMINER

The above-identified application is being remanded to the examiner for

appropriate action.

 

‘ Application filed December 23, 1994, for reissue of U.S. Patent No. 4,856,805 (Application No.
07/064,658, filed June 22, 1987).




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2002-1841 Page 2
Application No. 08/363,966

BACKGROUND

1. A review of the file record indicates that claims 57 to 65 have been rejected
under 35 U.S.C. § 251 as attempting to recapture subject matter surrendered in the
application to obtain the original patent.

2. A precedential opinion concerning a reissue recapture rejection under
35 U.S.C. § 251 was decided May 29, 2003 in Ex parte Eggert? In §gge_rt, the majority
opinion applied the fact-specific analysis set forth in In re Clement, 131 F.3d 1464,
1468-71 45 USPQ2d 1161, 1164-66 (Fed. Cir. 1997), determined that under the facts
and circumstances before it, the “surrendered subject matter" was claim 1 of Eggert as
that claim existed prior to the post-final rejection amendment that led to the allowance of
claim 1 in the original patent, and decided that reissue claims 15-22 of Eggert were n_ot
precluded (i.e., barred) by the “recapture ru|e." Slip. op. at 39-45.

ACTION

We remand this application to the examiner for a determination of whether the
rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 251 remains appropriate in view of Ex parte Eggert.

If the examiner determines that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 251 remains
appropriate, the examiner is authorized to prepare a supplemental examiner's answer

specifically addressing the § 251 rejection. See 37 CFR § 1.193(b)(1). In the event that

the examiner furnishes a supplemental answer, the appellant may file a reply brief in
accordance with 37 CFR § 1.193(b)(1).

If the examiner determines that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 251 is no longer
appropriate, the examiner should withdraw the rejection in an appropriate Office action.

CONCLUSION

This application, by virtue of its "special" status, requires immediate action, see
MPEP § 708.01.

If after action by the examiner in response to this remand there still remains
decision(s) of the examiner being appealed, the application should be promptly returned

to the Board of Patent Appeals and interferences.

In this case, the examiner is relying upon applicant's admission that the claimed

VACATUR AND REMAND

Before WILLIAM F. SMITH, ADAMS, and GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judges.

WILLIAM F. SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

This appeal involves plant patent Application No. 09/733,016. The question
raised in this appeal involves whether evidence of foreign sales of the claimed
reproducible plant variety may enable an otherwise non-enabled printed publication
disclosing the plant, thereby creating a bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). The Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered that issue in In re Elsner, 381 F.3d 1125,

72 USPQ2d 1038 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and held in the affirmative. L; at 1128, 72 USPQ2d

at 1041. In so holding, the court stated that “[t]he foreign sale must not be an

obscure, solitary occurrence that would go unnoticed by those skilled in the art." Id_. at
1131, 72 USPQ2d at 1043. The court also stated that the record did not establish that
“even if the interested public would readily know of the foreign sales, those sales
enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to reproduce the claimed plants without undue
experimentation." Q Thus, the court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the
case for “further factual findings relating to the accessibility of the foreign sales of the
claimed plants and the reproducibility of the claimed plants from the plants that were
sold." Id_.

In this case, the examiner is relying upon applicant's admission that the claimed
plant “was sold outside the United States on or about July 1, 1998" as evidence that QZ
PBR 980521, PL PBR PBO 0050, C2 PBR OPPH 06594, and ZA PBR 02603 are
enabled. Examiner's Answer, pages 4-7. However, there is no evidence whether the
sales were of the type that would be noticed by those of skill in the art. Nor has the
other issue raised by the Federal Circuit in %, whether the sales would enable one
skilled in the art to reproduce the claimed plant without undue experimentation, been
addressed.

Accordingly, we vacate the examiner's rejection and remand the case to the

examiner to determine whether the sales of the claimed plant (1) were “an obscure,

DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellants appeal the Examineﬂs ﬁnal rejection of claims 20-22, 24, 27 and 30.1

Because the issues are not ripe for appeal, we remand.

 

1 Claims 13-14 and 16 to 18 are pending in the present application and have been indicated as
containing allowable subject matter by ﬂne Examiner. (Answer, p. 2).




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2000-2202 Page 2
Application No. 08/810,049

OPINION
The Examiner relied on an Italian patent 590,156, identiﬁed as Avery Adhesive,
published on March 25, 1959 as evidence of obviousness. The Examiner states “Avery
Adhesive shows the construction of individual double sided adhesive tapes, 1 1, on a
continuous backing release layer, 20, with individual release sheets, 10, overlying the
individual tapes (See Figs. 1, 3).” (Answer, p. 4). The Examiner has not referred to the
text of the reference used to reach these determinations. It appears the Examiner has not
considered an English language translation of this document.’ A translation of this
document has now been obtained by the Board. The Examiner is required to consider the
translation of Italian patent 590,156 to determine if more or all of the limitations of the
claims on appeal are disclosed therein.
The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences is a board of review and not a

vehicle for initial examination. See 35 U.S.C. § 6(b)(2000). The burden is on the
Examiner to set forth a prima facie case of obviousness. See In re Alton, 76 F.3d 1168,

1175, 37 USPQ2d 1578, 1583 07 ed. Cir. 1996). Findings of fact and conclusions of law

2 We note that the Examiner should have obtained a complete translation of the reference during
prosecution, and not relied solely on the ﬁgures. It is now mandatory for such a translation to be
provided prior to forwarding the appeal to the Board. See, e.g. the April 29, 2002 memo from Deputy
Commissioner Kunin.




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2000-2202 Page 3
Application No. 08/8 10,049

must be made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706 (A),
(E) (1994). See Zurko v. Dickinson, 527 U.S. 150, 158, 119 S.Ct. 1816, 1821, 50
USPQ2d 1930, 1934 (1999). Findings of fact relied upon in making the obviousness
rejection must be supported by substantial evidence within the record. See In re
Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1315, 53 USPQ2d 1769, 1775 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

In light of the above facts, we feel it is premature to decide this appeal. More fact
ﬁnding needs to be completed on the record by the Examiner in view of the full English
language translation. Particularly, the Examiner is required to point out on a limitation-
by-limitation basis which portions of the cited references correspond to the limitations
recited in the claims. It is important that ambiguous or obscure bases for decision do not
stand as barriers to a determination of patentability.

CONCLUSION
In summary, the instant application is remanded to the Examiner to consider the

aforementioned issues and to act accordingly.
