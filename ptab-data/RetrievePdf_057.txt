Patent 5,836,013
INTRODUCTION
American Megatrends, Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI
Computer Corp., Giga-Byte Technology Co., Ltd., and G.B.T., Inc.,
(collectively, “Petitioner”) filed a Petition (Paper 6, “Pet.”) to institute an
inter partes review of claims 1, 2, 7, 10, 14, and 18 of Patent 5,836,013 (“the
’013 Patent”) pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 311 et seq. Patent Owner Kinglite
Holdings, Inc. filed a preliminary response (Paper 13, “Prelim. Resp.”) to
the Petition.
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 314(a), which provides that an
inter partes review may not be instituted unless the information presented in
the Petition shows “there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would
prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition.”
Upon consideration of the Petition, Patent Owner’s Preliminary Response,
and the evidence of record, we conclude Petitioner has not established a
reasonable likelihood it would prevail with respect to at least one of the
challenged claims. We, therefore, deny the Petition.

THE ’013 PATENT (Ex. 1001)
Described Invention
The ’013 Patent describes chipset (platform)-independent methods for
compressing and decompressing system ROM code of a computer (e.g.
BIOS, setup program, and one or more option ROMs). Ex. 1001, Abstract.
Compressing takes into account chipset particulars needed for reading to and
writing from registers associated with a particular chipset by appending
computer specific information (e.g., shadow RAM table) to the
uncompressed ROM file before compressing portions of it. Id.
Illustrative Claim
Claim 1 of the ’013 Patent is illustrative of the challenged claims:
3

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
1. In a computer having a processor and storage, a
computer-implemented method for generating a system read
only memory (ROM) computer file that can access the ROM of
a target computer, the method comprising the steps of:
receiving, for processing by the processor, a system
ROM computer file comprising a non-compressible
portion and one or more compressible portions,
including a setup program and one or more option
ROM images,
the
non-compressible
portion
comprising
a
decompression program;
appending, to the non-compressible portion, information
on accessing the ROM of a target computer;
compressing, via the processor, each compressible
portion to generate compressed data;
generating, via the processor, a compressed system ROM
computer file comprising the compressed data and the
appended non-compressible portion; and
storing the compressed system ROM computer file in the
storage.
PETITIONER’S CHALLENGE
Petitioner contends that claims 1, 2, 7, 10, 14, and 18 are unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. §103 because they are obvious based on Schieve1 and
AAPA2. Petitioner’s challenges are supported by the testimony of Gabriele
Sartori, Ph.D. Ex. 1014. Pet. 13.
Schieve describes how to run large diagnostic routines without taxing
a computer’s operating system resources. Schieve decompresses previously
compressed diagnostic routines into video RAM and runs them out of video
RAM in an environment created by a boot loader. Ex. 1002, Abstract.

“Schieve”)

The Applicant Admitted Prior Art includes ’013 Patent Figures 1–3 (Prior
Art) and other “admissions” in the Specification (collectively “AAPA”).

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
CLAIM CONSTRUCTION
The patent at issue will expire before a final written decision is issued.
The Board’s review of the claims of an expired patent is similar to that of a
district court’s review. Therefore, the principles set forth by the court in
Phillips v. AWH Corp., (words of a claim generally are given their ordinary
and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art
in question at the time of the invention) should be applied because the
expired claims are not subject to amendment.
Although the parties propose constructions for “setup program”
(claims 1, 8, and 10); “conventional memory” (claim 10); “decompressing
each compressed portion in the conventional memory to a location in the
memory” (claim 10); and “compressible” and “non-compressible” (all
challenged claims), we find it necessary to construe only “conventional
memory” in order to resolve the scope of claim 10. See Vivid Techs., Inc. v.
Am. Sci. & Eng’g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (only those terms
which are in controversy need to be construed, and only to the extent
necessary to resolve the controversy).
Conventional memory: Petitioner argues that “conventional memory”
should be construed to encompass “any kind of RAM in a personal
computer” because a person of ordinary skill in the art “would understand
that video RAM and other kinds of RAM were conventional as of the time
of invention.” Pet. 10.
Patent Owner argues that “conventional memory” refers specifically
to the basic 640K of memory available for running DOS programs (also
called DOS memory or low DOS memory. Prelim. Resp. 10 (citing to Ex.
1001, Fig. 1, 2:45–58).
5

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
Figure 1 (Prior Art) of the ’013, reproduced below, is a graphical
representation of typical memory map in a personal computer.

The ’013 patent explains Figure 1 as follows:
FIG. 1 is an example graphical representation of a typical
memory map 100 in a computer (e.g., an IBM compatible
personal computer, any Intel central processing unit (CPU)
-based machine, or similar computing devices). Memory
100 is generally divided into two areas: conventional
memory 110 and upper memory 120. Conventional memory
110 comprises a random access memory (RAM) 112 address
space that is set aside for use by operating systems and
application programs. Conventional memory 110 is, for
example, located in the 0 to 9FFFFh (Where “h” indicates
hexadecimal notation) address range of memory 100. Upper
memory 120 is used by the computer hardWare. Upper
memory 120 is, for example, located in the AOOOOh to
FFFFFh address range of memory 100. The first 128 kilo
6

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
bytes (“K”) of upper memory 120 addresses are generally
used for video memory 122. The remaining upper memory
addresses (e. g., 0000h to 100000h or the end of memory) are
set aside for read only memory (ROM) 130.
Ex. 1001, 2:45–63. We understand from this passage that “conventional
memory” referred only to lower memory and not to upper memory.
While we agree with Petitioner that video RAM and other kinds of
RAM were conventional in the sense that they were known and used, we are
not persuaded that the term “conventional memory” should be construed to
include video RAM. The Specification clearly identifies what was meant by
“conventional memory.” We therefore adopt Patent Owner’s construction.
For purposes of this decision, “conventional memory” refers to the basic
640K of memory available for running DOS programs.
PETITIONER’S PRIOR ART CHALLENGE
We turn now to Petitioner’s prior art challenge and Patent Owner’s
arguments set forth in its Preliminary Response to determine whether
Petitioner has met the threshold standard of 35 U.S.C. § 314(a).
Petitioner contends that claims 1, 2, 7, 10, 14, and 18 would have been
obvious based on Schieve and AAPA under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a), relying on
the supporting testimony of Gabrielle Sartori, Ph.D. Pet. 14–29. Claims 1
and 10 are independent. Claims 2 and 7 depend from claim 1 and claims 14
and 18 depend from claim 10.
Patent Owner argues that the Petition should be denied because at
least following limitations are not taught by the cited prior art:
- copying the compressed system ROM computer file from the ROM
to conventional memory (claims 10, 14, and 18);
- non-compressible portion/compressed portions (all challenged
7

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
claims);
- setup program (claims 1, 2, 7, 10, 14, and 18) and option ROM
images (claims 1, 2, and 7) are included in the compressible/compressed
portion; and
- appending, to the non-compressible portion, information on
accessing the ROM of a target computer (claims 1, 2, and 7).
Prelim. Resp. 1.
“copying . . . to conventional memory and decompressing
each compressed portion in the conventional memory to a
location in the memory” (claim 10)
Petitioner relies upon Schieve as meeting the claim 10 limitation
“copying . . . to conventional memory and decompressing each compressed
portion in the conventional memory to a location in the memory.” Pet. 27.
Petitioner reasons that video RAM can be thought of as being in either
memory subsystem; that diagnostic routines “could” be stored in system
RAM; and that a PHOSITA would understand that copying a compressed
file to RAM and then decompressing it would be faster because RAM is
faster than ROM. Id.
Patent Owner argues that Schieve does not disclose this claim
limitation. Prelim. Resp. 12. Patent Owner notes that Schieve decompresses
data into video memory and therefore teaches away from storing
decompressed diagnostic routines in conventional memory or anywhere
other than in video RAM. Id. at 12–13 (citing Ex. 1002, 3:46–51, 6:18–26,
Fig. 4, and claims 1, 8, 17, 21, 29, and 33).
In claim 10, we read the antecedent basis for “the memory” as
“conventional memory,” the only “memory” referred to in the claim and
appearing just before “the memory.”
8

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
Schieve explains solving the problem of running large diagnostic files
on a computer that would otherwise tax BIOS hardware handling routines:
In the attainment of the above noted primary object, the
present invention is the first to provide a method of
loading diagnostic routines in a computer system
comprising the steps of (l) executing a boot loading
routine stored in non-volatile memory within the computer
system, the boot loading routine including a
decompression routine, (2) decompressing a driver routine
and a compressed diagnostic routine stored in the non
volatile memory into video RAM, the driver routine
providing an environment in lieu of an operating system of
the computer system within which to execute the
diagnostic routine and (3) executing the driver routine
under control of the boot loading routine.
Ex. 1002, 3:13–25.
In accordance with our construction of “conventional memory,” we
agree with Patent Owner’s argument that Schieve’s teaching to a PHOSITA
is to utilize video RAM, and not conventional memory, for running a
decompressed diagnostic routine. Schieve’s Figure 2 is reproduced below
(with annotation).

9

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013

Schieve describes Figure 2 as a partial block diagram of a PC architecture.
Ex. 1002, 4:39–40. Video RAM 232 is shown in Figure 2 in a subsystem
separate from memory subsystem 220. As discussed above, the ’013 patent
itself, in Figure 1 (Prior Art), demonstrates that “conventional memory”
(RAM 112) is separate and distinct from “video memory” (video memory
122). Accordingly, this limitation of claim 10 is not met by Schieve.
“a non-compressible portion . . . the non-compressible portion
comprising a decompression program.” (claims 1, 2, and 7)
Petitioner argues that Schieve discloses “a non-compressible portion
and one or more compressible portions . . . . include[ing] a setup program
and one or more option ROM images, [the non-compressible portion
comprising a decompression program].” Pet. 18–19. Petitioner relies upon
AAPA (Fig. 3 of the ’013 patent) with regard to the setup and option ROM
requirements of this claim limitation. Pet. 18. Petitioner relies upon
Schieve as teaching the desirability of compressing any routine of the BIOS,
assuming it is capable of being compressed. Pet. 19 (citing to Ex. 1014, par.
10

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
49). Dr. Sartori’s testimony at paragraph 49 of Ex. 1014 states:
49. In Schieve, the system ROM is comprised of a flash
ROM, which has limited memory space. To counteract
these limitations, Schieve teaches the general desirability
of compressing data files where possible, such that “the
object [of the Schieve’s invention] is simply to compress
the data to fit it within the confines of flash ROM [sic].”
(Ex. 1002, 6:5–8) (emphasis omitted).
Petitioner argues that Schieve describes a decompression routine. Pet.
24 (citing Ex. 1002, 3:13–25) (reproduced above). Exhibit 1002 at column
3, lines 13–25 discloses that the boot loading routine includes a
decompression routine. It further discloses that the driver routine and the
diagnostic routine must have been compressed (they are being
decompressed). It also tells us that the driver routine provides an
environment for executing the diagnostic routine. However, we find nothing
in this passage that instructs that the decompressing routine should be stored
in a non-compressible portion.
The remaining portion of the SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
(containing the above-quoted passage) discusses the importance of correctly
storing the diagnostic routine so that the decompression routine can properly
decompress it for use. Id. at 3:25–51.
Patent Owner argues that Schieve and AAPA do not disclose “a noncompressible portion . . . the non-compressible portion comprising a
decompression program.” Prelim. Resp. 13. We agree.
“The setup program and one or more option ROM images are
included in the compressible portion”(claims 1, 2, and 7)
Petitioner relies upon Schieve’s visual interface by which a user
selects the diagnostic routines as corresponding to the claimed setup
11

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
program because it “accomplishes the [same] functionality” of a setup
program that is stored with BIOS. Pet. 18.
Patent Owner argues that Schieve and AAPA do not disclose “the
setup program and one or more option ROM images are included in the
compressible portion.” Prelim. Resp. 14–17. The AAPA discloses optional
ROM images, as well as a setup program that accomplishes the same
functionality of a conventional setup program stored with BIOS. Id. (citing
Ex. 1001, 1:40–41). The art does not disclose the setup program and the
option ROM images that are included in a compressible portion of a system
ROM computer file, as required.
We agree with Patent Owner that Petitioner has not demonstrated that
this claim feature is taught by Schieve and AAPA.
For the above-stated reasons, Petitioner’s showing regarding claims 1
and 10 is deficient. Therefore we do not institute. The Petition has at least
the following additional shortcomings.
“appending, to the noncompressible portion, information on
accessing the ROM of a target computer”(claims 1, 2, and 7)
Petitioner argues that Schieve teaches “appending, to the
noncompressible portion, information on accessing the ROM of a target
computer” because Schieve’s boot loading and compressed diagnostic
routines are “checksum tested” to make certain of code integrity. Pet. 20
(citing Ex. 1002, 5:57–60). Further, according to Petitioner, “the boot
loading routine decompresses a first diagnostic routine from flash ROM into
video RAM (block 470).” Id. (citing Ex. 1002, 5:57–60).
We do not regard comparing checksums as appending information on
accessing the ROM of a target computer.
12

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
“generating, via the processor, a compressed system ROM
computer file comprising the compressed data and the
appended non-compressible portion.” (claims 1, 2, and 7)
Patent Owner further argues with respect to claim 1 that Schieve does
not disclose “generating, via the processor, a compressed system ROM
computer file comprising the compressed data and the appended noncompressible portion.” Prelim. Resp. 18–19.
We agree. Because Schieve does not disclose the “appending” step,
discussed above, Schieve also fails to disclose this limitation, which requires
generating a file containing the appended information.
“the system ROM computer file comprises a basic
input/output system (BIOS) and the BIOS
comprises the non-compressible portion” (claim 2)
Patent Owner argues that Schieve does not disclose “the system ROM
computer file comprises a basic input/output system (BIOS) and the BIOS
comprises the non-compressible portion” Prelim. Resp. 19.
This limitation appears in claim 2, which depends from claim 1.
Petitioner contends that “Schieve discloses that the ROM computer file is a
BIOS and the BIOS comprises the non-compressible portion.” Pet. 22
(citation omitted). Petitioner does not provide explain sufficiently why this
is the case. Schieve also does not specify any components that are noncompressible, as discussed above.
Claims 7, 14, and 18
Claim 7 depends from claim 1. For the reasons stated above with
respect to claim 1, we are persuaded by Patent Owner’s arguments. Claims
14 and 18 are not separately argued.

13

Case IPR2015-01188
Patent 5,836,013
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we determine that the information
presented in the Petition does not establish a reasonable likelihood that
Petitioner would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of claims 1, 2, 7,
10, 14, and 18 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as obvious over Schieve and the
AAPA.
ORDER
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 314, an inter partes review is
hereby denied as to all grounds raised in the Petition for the reasons stated
above and no trial is instituted.
