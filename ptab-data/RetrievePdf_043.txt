I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
International Business Machines Corporation (“Petitioner”) filed a
second corrected Petition requesting an inter partes review of claims 18–31
(the “challenged claims”) of U.S. Patent No. 5,745,574 (Ex. 1004,2 “the ’574
patent”) under 35 U.S.C. §§ 311–319. Paper 13 (“Petition” or “Pet.”).
Petitioner also filed another Petition requesting an inter partes review of
claim 30 of the ’574 patent. IPR2014-01410, Paper 2 (“1410 Pet.”). On
October 20, 2014, we instituted an inter partes review in IPR2014-00660.
Paper 19 (“Decision” or “Dec. on Inst.”). On December 18, 2014, we
instituted an inter partes review in IPR2014-01410 and consolidated that
trial with the instant trial. IPR2014-01410, Paper 8 (“1410 Dec. on Inst.”).
Intellectual Ventures II LLC (“Patent Owner”) filed a Patent Owner
Response. Paper 29 (“Response” or “PO Resp.”). Petitioner filed a Reply.

Patent 5,745,574
Paper 16, 3.
C. The ’574 Patent
The ’574 patent relates to public key encryption (PKE), which is used
for securing and authenticating transmissions over unsecure networks. Ex.
1004, 1:6–8, 1:10–2:9. To use PKE for authenticating transmissions, a
transmitted message is encrypted with a sender’s private encryption key (a
key known only to the sender, sometimes referred to as a “secret key”) that
can only be decrypted by the sender’s public encryption key (freely
available), ensuring that the message was sent by the sender. Id. at 1:57–65.
A public key infrastructure (PKI), with a hierarchical system of encrypting
lower nodes’ public keys, allows for a common point of trust between two
parties who wish to communicate with each other. Id. at 3:16–39. The ’574
patent explains that some of the problems with conventional PKE systems
include that such systems do not have a “consistent public key infrastructure
which can actually and automatically provide the certifications required for a
public key system[, a] hierarchical arrangement of certifying authorities
which can cross policy certifying authority boundaries[, or a convenient and
transparent] way for permitting secure transactions to cross organizational
boundaries.” Id. at 4:41–51. The ’574 patent purports to “provid[e] a full,
correct, consistent and very general security infrastructure which will
support global secure electronic transactions across organizational, political
and policy certifying authority boundaries.” Id. at 4:55–59.

3

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
The challenged claims recite various processes used within a PKI
system to request, issue, and update public key certificates, add nodes or
entities to the hierarchy, and verify and validate certificates received. Figure
4 of the ’574 patent is reproduced below:

Figure 4 depicts a logical representation of a portion of a hierarchical PKI
and one way in which that infrastructure may be used to verify transactions.
Ex. 1004, 8:17–29. As can be seen in Figure 4, a hierarchy includes
certification authorities (CAs) CA1–CA4 and users U1 and U2. Id. at Fig. 4.
Not depicted in Figure 4, at a level above CA1, is a policy certifying
authority (PCA), “which defines a particular set of certification policies
[and] set[s] the standards for their particular certification sub-hierarchies.”
Id. at 9:26–30. Each of the CAs follows the policies set by the PCA they fall
under and can then certify subordinate CAs “in a hierarchical fashion until
ultimately the end users are certified at the bottom of the hierarchy.” Id. at
9:37–42.
In order for U2 to be added to the hierarchy and obtain a public key
certificate, which will allow U2 to send communications that can be verified
and validated by a recipient, U2 would send an application for registration to
the PCA. Ex. 1004, 13:65–67. Any other node would follow the same
4

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
procedure in order to participate in the PKI and obtain certificates, so that
CAs may certify other nodes, and users may send communications that can
be verified and validated by a recipient. The PCA may accept or reject the
application for registration. Id. at 14:1–7. If the PCA accepts the
application, the new node is added to a network map certification
infrastructure database, and the node performs steps to obtain a certificate.
Id. at 15:59–67.
A CA or user obtains a certificate by generating new public and
private keys, generating a certificate including the newly generated public
key and any other information required by the policies established by the
PCA, self-signing the certificate, and sending the certificate in a message to
the issuing CA (the CA above it in the hierarchy) to request a signature from
that CA. Ex. 1004, 14:24–34, 15:4–9. The CA uses policies established by
the PCA to authenticate the request. Id. at 14:35–41. If authenticated, the
CA signs the certificate, stores a copy and/or sends a copy to a certificate
repository, and issues the certificate by sending the signed certificate back to
the CA or user in a reply message. Id. at 14:47–52.
When a node’s certificate expires, the node follows a similar process
of generating new keys and requesting issuance of a new certificate from its
issuing CA. If the issuing CA determines that the requesting node is an
already-existing node, the issuing CA also marks the node’s old certificate
as revoked and adds it to a certificate revocation list (CRL). Ex. 1004,
14:43–47.
The requesting node authenticates the reply message received from
the issuing CA by comparing the public key in the signed certificate with the
public key that corresponds to the private key used for signing the message

5

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
sent from the node to the issuing CA. Ex. 1004, 14:54–60, 15:10–22. If the
keys match, the node stores the signed certificate. Id. at 14:54–63. If the
node is a CA with subordinate nodes to which it issued signed certificates,
the CA must update those certificates. Id. at 15:22–25. The CA sends resigned certificates to each of its subordinate nodes (if any), which results in
each subordinate node iteratively receiving a new signed certificate and
determining whether that node has subordinate nodes for which it needs to
reissue certificates. Id. at 15:44–58.
Once a node receives a signed certificate from its issuing CA, other
nodes in the PKI may verify and validate the certificate. Ex. 1004, 1:57–65,
3:22–39, 6:65–7:20, 11:66–12:43. Referring back to Figure 4, U1 may
receive a signed message from user U2. Id. at 12:1–2, Fig. 4. U2 may send a
certificate with the signed message or, in cases where U2 does not send a
certificate, U1 may request the certificate from U2. Id. at 12:7–13. U1 also
may request a certificate from CA2 and CA3. Id. at 12:12–13. Certificates
may be obtained from the owner of the certificate, the CA that issued the
certificate, or from a common repository. Id. at 13:32–35. Each node may
store a certificate for itself and every CA above that node to the highest level
node (e.g., a PCA or a Policy Registration Authority (PRA), which is above
a PCA in the PKI hierarchy), such that in the example depicted in Figure 4,
U2 may store a certificate for itself and a certificate for each of CA1, CA2,
and CA3. Id. at 12:2–6. As seen in Figure 4, node CA1 is the lowest point in
the hierarchy in common between U1 and U2 and is known as the common
point of trust between U1 and U2. Id. at 12:41–43, Fig. 4.
Upon receiving a response to a request for a certificate from a node
(e.g., U2, CA2, and CA3), U1 extracts, verifies, and stores the certificate. Ex.

6

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
1004, 12:17–20. U1 may then authenticate the received certificates starting
at the top of the hierarchy. Id. at 12:22–42. U1 already has a known valid
certificate for CA1 and uses CA1’s public key to authenticate CA2’s
certificate that was issued by CA1. Id. at 12:22–27. The process is iterated
using CA2’s public key to authenticate CA3’s certificate, then using CA3’s
public key to authenticate U2’s certificate. Id. at 12:27–39.
For reliable certification, U1 should also obtain a CRL to ensure that
each certificate has not been revoked. Ex. 1004, 12:65–67. U1 can send a
request to CA1, CA2, and CA3 (or, alternatively, to a common repository) for
the CRL maintained by each CA. Id. at 12:67–13:3, 13:14–24.
D. Illustrative Claims
Of the challenged claims in the ’574 patent, claims 18, 23, 28, 30, and
31 are independent. Claims 18, 23, 28, 30, and 31 each are directed to
methods for implementing various portions of the process of using PKE to
certify secure communications. Therefore, claims 18, 23, 28, 30, and 31 are
illustrative, and recite:
18. In a certification system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of requesting and issuing a public key
certificate, comprising:
a. at a requesting computer process, generating a data structure
containing the data items required for a public key certificate,
including a public key, self-signing the data structure and
sending the signed data structure as a certificate signature
request to a computer process authorized as an issuing
certification authority, and
b. at said computer process authorized as an issuing certification
authority, verifying the authenticity of said request, and if
authentic, certifying and returning the data structure in a
certificate signature reply.

7

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
23. In a global network with secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of verifying a signed data structure sent from
a sender to a receiver, comprising:
a. obtaining a public key certificate for every computer process in
the infrastructure between the sender and a common point of
trust in the infrastructure and
b. verifying the authenticity of signatures iteratively, beginning
with the common point of trust.
28. In a certification system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of validating public key certificates,
comprising:
using the certificate revocation lists of each computer process
between a computer process or user whose certificate is being
validated and a point of trust in common with the computer
process or user which is validating the certificate to ensure the
certificates being used in the validation process do not appear
on any certificate revocation list.
30. In a computer system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of updating certificates, comprising:
a. at a first computer process, which possesses a certificates to be
updated, updating the current certificate by
a.1. receiving a new signed certificate from a computer process
which is authorized to issue the new signed certificate,
a.2. revoking the current certificate previously used for
verification of certificates of subordinate computer
processes,
a.3. issuing new certificates to all subordinate computer
processes for which certificates had been previously signed
by the first computer process and copying to all subordinate
computer processes the new certificate to be used for
verification of new subordinate certificates, and
b. iteratively performing the distribution of the new certificate to
all subsequent subordinate computer processes, until all
8

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
computer processes subordinate in the infrastructure to said first
computer process have the new certificates.
31. In a certification system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of adding a new computer process to the
infrastructure, comprising:
a. adding a new component to a representation of a certification
infrastructure at a location indicative of where the said
computer process is to be added,
b. creating entries in a certificate storage database at least at both
said new computer process and at the computer process
authorized to certify the said new process,
c. obtaining a signed certificate for the said new computer process
from said computer process authorized to certify the new
process and storing it at the said new computer process.
Ex. 1004, 19:4761, 20:816, 20:3242, 20:4667, 21:114.

II. ANALYSIS
A. Claim Construction
In an inter partes review, claim terms are given their broadest
reasonable interpretation in light of the specification in which they appear
and the understanding of others skilled in the relevant art. See 37 C.F.R.
§ 42.100(b). Applying that standard, we interpret the claim terms of the

10

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
’574 patent according to their ordinary and customary meaning in the
context of the written description. See In re Translogic Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d
1249, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303,
1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc)). Patent Owner submits proposed claim
constructions for three terms or phrases—process, common certificate
repository, and verified by a direct inquiry to the certification authority. PO
Resp. 11–15. Petitioner argues the plain and ordinary meaning should be
attributed to each term. Reply 8–12.
“computer process”
Patent Owner argues that “the broadest reasonable interpretation of
‘process’ . . . include[s] ‘computer program instructions running on a
computer.’”5 PO Resp. 11. Patent Owner alleges that its proposed
construction is consistent with the specification of the ’574 patent because
the description of Figure 1A explains that each block in the flow chart “is
implemented as a computer process running on a computer.” Id.
Petitioner argues Patent Owner’s proposed construction is unlimited
and indefinite because it provides no clear bounds and merely states that it
would “include computer program instructions running on a computer.”
Reply 8–9 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Petitioner asserts
that Patent Owner’s proposed construction does not clarify the claim
language and, in fact, introduces ambiguity.
5

The heading for the portion of the Response directed to Patent Owner’s
arguments addressing the construction of process is similar to, but
inconsistent with, arguments made in that section. Specifically, Patent
Owner’s heading is: “The proper interpretation of ‘process’ is ‘a computer
program loaded into memory and executing in a processor.’” The reasons
discussed herein for declining to adopt Patent Owner’s proposed
construction apply equally to the construction identified in the heading.
11

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Petitioner also submits that Patent Owner implicitly excludes human
intervention from its proposed construction. Reply 9. Petitioner argues that
manual intervention is not excluded from the challenged claims, which recite
methods “comprising” steps performed at a computer process. Id. at 12–13.
In support of its arguments, Petitioner points to the ’574 patent’s disclosure
that “[t]he appropriate process can be invoked manually by commands as
well.” Id. at 13 (quoting Ex. 1004, 17:59–67) (emphasis omitted).
Petitioner further argues Patent Owner’s declarant, Dr. Frederic T. Chong ,
admitted that the ’574 patent contemplates manually invoking a process. Id.
(citing Ex. 1030, 94:17–25). Thus, Petitioner argues that the recitation of
computer processes does not exclude all manual intervention, and that the
plain and ordinary meaning is clear from the specification. Id.
We agree with Petitioner that Patent Owner’s proposed construction
adds no clarity to the meaning of the term “process.” We further agree that
“process,” or more specifically, “computer process,” as recited in each of the
challenged claims, should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. To the
extent that there might have been ambiguity as to the plain and ordinary
meaning, the references in the’574 patent to computer processes support the
idea that a skilled artisan would have understood what was meant by the
recitation of the term. In particular, the’574 patent discloses that “[e]ach
user or certification authority of the infrastructure has access to a computer
process which comprises appropriate certification software and storage areas
for storing data structures.” Ex. 1004, 5:55–57. The’574 patent explains
that the invention is directed to a certification system, which:
includes computer processes implementing certification
servers, certification clients and certification protocols, in
which one or more first computer processes are associated with

12

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
at least one initial (root) registration authority, one or more
second computer processes are associated with policy
certification authorities, one or more third computer processes
are associated with certification authorities, and one or more
end-user computer processes or application computer processes
are associated with respective end-users or user applications.
Id. at 6:1–13 (emphasis added); see id. at 1:64–66. The’574 patent further
explains that the processes are arranged in a hierarchy, that each of these
processes may hold certified data structures (i.e., certificates), and that
“users and applications of said system are logically located at end-points of
certification chains in a certification infrastructure.” Id. at 6:14–22.
The computer processes use “a common application programming
interface [API] for access to encryption and certification services,” and the
API “is a set of certification functions which can be invoked by commands
or by messages, such as an http command, an email message or program to
program communication.” Ex. 1004, 5:62–67. Figures 7 through 27 of the
’574 patent “describe a set of processes which collectively form the
certification system, functions, and certification infrastructure of this
invention.” Id. at 13:53–55. “The commands and processes described in
FIGS 7-2[7] thus present a set of protocol and programming primitives
which may be invoked either directly by a user or by part of an application
process running on the user’s or CA’s computer.” Id. at 13:57–61. The’574
patent further explains that a certification server process continuously
monitors incoming messages and commands, which may be invoked
manually, and determines which of the certification functions described in
Figures 7 through 27 should be called. Id.at 17:55–67.
Moreover, as discussed above, the’574 patent refers to entities
(including PCA, CAs, and users) as being associated with computer
13

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
processes. See, e.g., Ex. 1004, 1:64–66. Throughout the specification and,
in particular in the description of the specific messages and “processes
which collectively form the certification system” (see id. at 13:53–17:54),
the ’574 patent refers to entities as sending and receiving messages and
executing processes. The ’574 patent refers to these processes and entities
interchangeably. Id.
Thus, an ordinarily skilled artisan would have understood that the
recited computer processes are instances of a computer program or programs
running on the various computers, each of which may be associated with
different nodes or entities (e.g., policy certification authorities, certification
authorities, user applications) that carry out the tasks involved in the
certification system described by the ’574 patent. Functions specifically
recited as being performed at or by a computer process obviously exclude
performance of that function that does not involve a computer process.
Beyond steps explicitly recited as performed at or by a computer process,
however, we find nothing in the recitations of a computer process that would
exclude manual invocation or other manual intervention.
“common certificate repository”
Patent Owner argues that the broadest reasonable interpretation of
“common certificate repository” is “a repository that stores public key
certificates for all certification authorities [in the certification
infrastructure].” PO Resp. 12. Patent Owner asserts that the ’574 patent,
which states that a “common certificate repository may contain public key
certificates for all certification authorities in the hierarchy,” requires a
construction that a common certificate repository keeps a certificate for each

14

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
and every certification authority in the infrastructure. Id. (quoting Ex. 1004,
5:51–52).
Petitioner points to the fact that the ’574 patent discloses that the
common certificate repository may include public key certificates for all
CAs and/or CRLs for multiple users or processes in the hierarchy. Reply 10.
Thus, Petitioner argues that the ’574 patent uses the permissive “may” and
alternative “or,” indicating that a common certificate repository may store,
some, all, or none of the certificates in the hierarchy or infrastructure. Id.
Because we use the broadest reasonable interpretation for construing
claims, we decline to limit the construction of common certificate repository
to require storage of public key certificates for all CAs, or even all CAs
within a hierarchy or infrastructure. Other than declining to adopt Patent
Owner’s proposed narrowing of the plain and ordinary meaning of a
common certificate repository, we do not find it necessary to provide an
explicit construction of the term.
Whether recitation of a method step introduced by “may” further limits a
claim
Before we address the parties’ arguments regarding the construction
of “verified by a direct inquiry to the certification authority,” recited in claim
25, we must first address the use of “may” to introduce limitations in claims
25–27. “[O]ptional elements do not narrow the claim because they can
always be omitted.” In re Johnston, 435 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2006).
Claims that use the term “may” to introduce a limitation are permissive and,
thus, do not narrow the scope of the claim. Id. Thus, the use of the term
“may” or “may also” in claims 25–27 is not limiting. Specifically, claims
25–27, which recite “[t]he method of verifying of claim 23 in which a public

15

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
key certificate . . . may” be obtained or verified by various steps, do not
further limit claim 23, from which they depend.
We are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that claim 25,
which recites that the method of claim 23 “may also be verified by a direct
inquiry,” “provides an alternative” approach to the iterative approach recited
in claim 23. PO Resp. 14; see Johnston, 435 F.3d at 1385. Therefore, for
purposes of this inter partes review, we construe claims 25–27 to be of the
same scope as, and stand or fall with, independent claim 23.
With respect to claim 22, which recites in part that “the new
certificate may contain either the existing or a new public key,” the parties
appear to agree that the recited language requires the certificate to have
either the existing public key or a new public key. However, we find that
the permissive language in claim 22 also fails to further limit the claim. The
claim could have recited that the certificate contains (as opposed to may
contain) either the existing or a new public key. Therefore, we find the
scope of claim 22 to be the same as if the claim recited: “The method of
claim 18, performed upon expiration of an existing certificate.”
“verified by a direct inquiry to the certification authority”
The parties dispute the proper construction of this phrase. However,
we need not reach this issue because the disputed phrase is recited only in
claim 25 as part of a non-limiting clause. As discussed above, we construe
claims 25–27 to be of the same scope as claim 23.
B. The Asserted Grounds
1. Anticipation of Claims 18–31 by Kapidzic
Petitioner asserts claims 18–31 are unpatentable as anticipated by
Kapidzic, and provides a chart showing where Kapidzic allegedly discloses

16

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
each limitation. Pet. 8–25; 1410 Pet. 6–28. As explained below, we
conclude that Petitioner has met its burden to show, by a preponderance of
the evidence, as required by 35 U.S.C. § 316(e), that claims 18–31 are
unpatentable as anticipated by Kapidzic.
a. Kapidzic (Ex. 1007)
Kapidzic is one paper in a collection of papers, which were the subject
of a symposium on network and distributed system security. Ex. 1007, 2;
Ex. 1006, 1. Kapidzic discloses a “Certificate Management System (CMS),”
which “is a networked system for generation, distribution, storage and
verification of certificates for use in a variety of security enhanced
applications.” Ex. 1007, 5.
Figure 1 of Kapidzic is reproduced below:

Patent 5,745,574
b. Whether Kapidzic Is Prior Art
Patent Owner argues that Kapidzic is not prior art under § 102(a)
because “to the extent that Kapidzic discloses any of the concepts of claims
18–31 of the ’574 patent, these concepts were derived from Dr. Sead Muftic,
the sole inventor of those concepts.” PO Resp. 18 (citing Ex. 2005 ¶ 13).
Specifically, Patent Owner asserts that “Dr. Muftic conceived of the
concepts claimed in the ’574 patent,” and “[t]he concepts described in
Kapidzic also originated from Dr. Muftic.” Id. at 19. Patent Owner
acknowledges that testimony of the inventor of the ’574 patent is not, by
itself, enough to show conception, and that Patent Owner must provide
sufficient corroborative evidence that all of the ideas in Kapidzic are
attributable to Dr. Muftic. See Tr. 28:11–29:12, 34:20–24, 37:16–38:5.
Patent Owner further acknowledges that, in order to be disqualified as a
prior art reference under § 102(a), Kapidzic needs to be only Dr. Muftic’s
work. Id. at 41:5–19.
Dr. Muftic testifies that: (1) he conceived of all the concepts described
in Kapidzic; (2) Dr. Nada Kapidzic was his Ph.D. student from about 1992
to 1997; (3) Mr. Alan Davidson was his Licentiate student from about 1992
to 1995; (4) he explained the details of the concepts in Kapidzic to Dr.
Kapidzic, who wrote about them under Dr. Muftic’s direction and
supervision; (5) Mr. Davidson wrote a computer program prototype
implementing the concepts of the system described in Kapidzic, and Mr.
Davidson assisted Dr. Kapidzic in writing Kapidzic; (6) he omitted his name
from Kapidzic to allow Dr. Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson to receive
publication credit to help build their academic careers; (7) he has had a
similar practice in other situations to aid students in building their academic

18

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
careers and attend conferences; (8) he had already co-authored two papers
(Exs. 2002, 2004, collectively “the two co-authored articles”) in the same
area and multiple articles in the field of computer security and “did not deem
it important to list [him]self as an author on the Kapidzic article”; and (9) the
contributions in Kapidzic are his contributions, not Dr. Kapidzic’s or Mr.
Davidson’s. Ex. 2005 ¶¶ 13–16, 19–22, 25–33. Patent Owner submits that
Dr. Muftic’s testimony is supported by circumstantial evidence, namely: (1)
the co-authors of Kapidzic (i.e., Nada Kapidzic and Alan Davidson) were
Dr. Muftic’s graduate students; (2) Dr. Muftic is listed as co-author, with Dr.
Kapidzic, on a paper published around the same time as Kapidzic and
relating to the same area (Ex. 2002); and (3) Dr. Muftic is listed as coauthor, with Dr. Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson, on another paper published
around the same time and relating to the same area (Ex. 2004). PO Resp.
19–21; Tr., 29:8–23, 30:18–31:2, 39:17–40:2.
At oral argument, Patent Owner pointed, for the first time, to
additional evidence that it argues corroborates Dr. Muftic’s testimony.
Specifically, at oral argument Patent Owner pointed to: (1) a portion of Dr.
Kapidzic’s doctoral thesis (Ex. 2006), which thanks Dr. Muftic for his
“supervision and constant generation of new ideas” (Ex. 2006, page H); and
(2) Dr. Chong’s testimony that events similar to those Dr. Muftic described
regarding the history of Kapidzic “are commonplace in the academic
community” (Ex. 2007 ¶ 31). Tr. 29:24–30:12, 33:1–14, 40:3–12. Patent
Owner asserts that the two co-authored articles corroborate the fact that Dr.
Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson were Dr. Muftic’s graduate students (Tr. 36:14–
24), and that Patent Owner only needs to provide sufficient circumstantial

19

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
evidence to corroborate Dr. Muftic’s statements. Id. at 29:10–12, 37:7–14
(citing Cooper v. Goldfarb, 154 F.3d 1321, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).
Petitioner argues that Patent Owner has only uncorroborated
testimony from Dr. Muftic that the ideas in Kapidzic all originated from Dr.
Muftic. Reply 4–7. As referenced by Petitioner, the requirement for
corroboration of inventor testimony “arose out of a concern that inventors
testifying in patent infringement cases would be tempted to remember facts
favorable to their case by the lure of protecting their patent or defeating
another’s patent.” Mahurkar v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 79 F.3d 1572, 1577 (Fed.
Cir. 1996); see Reply 5. Petitioner argues Dr. Muftic is biased and points to
Dr. Muftic’s deposition testimony, in which he stated that he had a “personal
pride interest that [the ’574] patent stands as valid and firm.” Reply 5
(quoting Ex. 1031, 55:15–17). Petitioner asserts Dr. Muftic admitted he has
no written records to corroborate his claim that he conceived of the ideas in
Kapidzic. Petitioner also argues Dr. Muftic was not able to identify with
specificity which ideas he contributed to the two co-authored articles. Id. at
6 (citing Ex. 1031, 36:4–37:15, 49:23–50:15, 51:2–51:12). Finally,
Petitioner points to Dr. Kapidzic’s doctoral thesis as further evidence that
the ideas in Kapidzic were hers and Mr. Davidson’s, not Dr. Muftic’s. In
particular, Petitioner points to the “Publications Overview” section of Dr.
Kapidzic’s thesis, which states that she “was the main designer of the overall
CMS system, as well as of the CMS Client [and t]he functionality of CMS
servers (CAs) was designed by the author in co-operation with Alan
Davidson.” Ex. 2006, 3–4; see Tr. 60:17–20. That section continues by
stating that Kapidzic, referred to in the thesis as “KAP2,” was “published as
the result of the author’s work,” “presents the overall design of CMS (done

20

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
by the author), as well as its functions and protocols (done by the author in
co-operation with Alan Davidson),” and “represents the bases for Chapter 3
of this thesis.” Ex. 2006, 4 (emphases added).
Although we agree that authorship of articles is not necessarily
determinative of whose ideas are present in a paper, we do not find Patent
Owner has sufficiently corroborated Dr. Muftic’s testimony to establish that
the entirety of Kapidzic can be attributed solely to Dr. Muftic. Patent Owner
asserts that the Federal Circuit’s decision in Cooper stands for the
proposition that every point of Dr. Muftic’s testimony does not need to be
corroborated. Tr. 37:7–12. Cooper specifically states, however, that
“sufficient circumstantial evidence of an independent nature can satisfy the
corroboration requirement.” Cooper, 154 F.3d at 1330 (emphasis added).
We agree with Patent Owner that it has sufficiently established that Dr.
Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson were students advised by Dr. Muftic at the time
Kapidzic was written. We also agree that Patent Owner has sufficient
circumstantial evidence to corroborate that Dr. Muftic was at least working
in the same field at around the same time. The circumstantial evidence also
appears to corroborate that Dr. Muftic may have contributed to Kapidzic, at
least in an advisory role. What we find lacking, however, is sufficient
independent circumstantial evidence corroborating Dr. Muftic’s testimony
that the entirety of the ideas in Kapidzic originated with Dr. Muftic.
Other than Dr. Muftic’s own testimony, there is no evidence on record
regarding which aspects of either of the two co-authored articles were his.
See Reply 6. Even looking to Dr. Muftic’s testimony, Patent Owner has not
established sufficiently which aspects of Kapidzic it alleges originated with
Dr. Muftic. See Ex. 2005 ¶¶ 13, 17, 24–26, 33. In fact, Dr. Kapidzic’s

21

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
doctoral thesis, as discussed above, directly contradicts Dr. Muftic’s
testimony, and states that the ideas in Kapidzic were those of only Dr.
Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson. Ex. 2006, 3. Dr. Kapidzic’s thesis was
submitted approximately two years after Kapidzic was published, whereas
Dr. Muftic’s testimony is nearly two decades later. Id. at page B. Moreover,
Dr. Muftic was Dr. Kapidzic’s advisor and, presumably, had an opportunity
to review the thesis. Weighing the submitted evidence, we find Patent
Owner has not established that Kapidzic is entirely the work of Dr. Muftic.
Therefore, Patent Owner has not established that Kapidzic should be
disqualified as prior art.
c. Claims 18, 19, and 21
Kapidzic discloses a requester in a CMS sending a certificate request
message to a certificate authority (CA) and the CA sending back a message
with a signed certificate, which Petitioner maps to “a method of requesting
and issuing a public key certificate,” as recited in the preamble of
independent claim 18. Pet. 8, 10 (citing Ex. 1007, 5, 7, 8). Kapidzic further
discloses a CA generating a pair of keys (public and private), and sending a
self-signed certificate created from the public key to a parent CA. Ex. 1007,
7–8. Petitioner maps that disclosure of Kapidzic to the first method step
reciting that one process generates a certificate with a public key, self-signs
the certificate, and sends the self-signed certificate in a request to an issuing
CA. Pet. 8, 10. Kapidzic also discloses the parent CA verifies the request,
signs the certificate, and sends a reply back to the requester, which Petitioner
maps to the recited step of the issuing CA process “verifying the authenticity
of said request, and . . . certifying and returning the” certificate to the
requesting process in a reply. Id. at 8, 11 (citing Ex. 1007, 7–8).

22

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Kapidzic uses the same terminology to describe the process recited in
independent claim 18. The Petition and Dr. Matthew Blaze’s Declaration
both refer to Kapidzic’s description of its certification process in support of
the argument that Kapidzic discloses the method recited in independent
claim 18. Pet. 9–11; Ex. 1001 ¶¶ 74, 77. Dr. Blaze also references Figure 2
of Kapidzic (Ex. 1001 ¶ 74), which is reproduced below:

Figure 2 depicts an example of a certification process of a CA by its parent
CA (in this case a PCA) in the CMS disclosed by Kapidzic. Ex. 1007, 7.
Patent Owner argues that “Kapidzic does not state anywhere that the
certification authorities (CAs) or other components of the CMS are
processes that perform these features.” PO Resp. 22. Patent Owner asserts
that Kapidzic’s certification process, which Patent Owner submits requires
manual intervention, does not meet the method recited in claim 18, which
includes “at said computer process . . . verifying the authenticity of said
[certificate signature] request, and if authentic, certifying and returning the
23

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
data structure in a certificate signature reply.” Id. Patent Owner specifically
points to the disclosures in Kapidzic that the certificate signature request and
reply messages are sent as “e-mail letters” and that verifying the identity of a
requester “will normally require manual intervention,” arguing that sending
email messages cannot be used to automate certification because it requires
manual inspection. Id. at 22–24 (quoting Ex. 1007, 7–8).
Petitioner argues Patent Owner’s assertion that “[v]erifying the
identity of the requester ‘will normally require manual intervention and . . .
is defined to be [an] off-line process,’” (PO Resp. 23) is not relevant,
because claim 18 requires verifying the authenticity of a certificate signature
request, not the identity of a requester. Reply 14. Petitioner further argues
that, to the extent that claim 18 does require a computer process to verify an
identify, Kapidzic teaches such a step because the disclosure that manual
intervention is normally required indicates that manual intervention is not
required, at least some of the time. Id. at 14–15.
As discussed above, we do not find persuasive Patent Owner’s claim
construction argument that all manual intervention is excluded by the claim.
Nevertheless, we evaluate Petitioner’s arguments as applied to the properly
construed claims to ascertain whether Kapidzic discloses performing the
recited step as claimed. The steps that claim 18 recites as being performed
“at a computer process” are “generating a data structure,” “sending the
signed data structure,” “verifying the authenticity of said [certificate
signature] request,” and “certifying and returning the data structure.” In the
context of Kapidzic, it is clear that generating a data structure, which
includes generating RSA keys and which is subsequently sent via email,
sending the signed data structure, which is done via email, and returning the

24

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
data structure, which is also done via email, are all steps that involve
computer processes. See Ex. 1007, 7–8. Thus, our focus is on whether
Kapidzic discloses verifying the authenticity and certifying the data structure
“at a computer process.”
With respect to the certifying step, Kapidzic explains that “[i]f all the
checks verify successfully, the parent CA signs the certificate and . . . creates
a Certificate Signature Reply that contains the signed certificate.” Ex. 1007,
8. This description indicates that the certification done by the parent CA
includes “signing” the electronic data structure and, thus, involves a
computer process. The verifying the authenticity step also requires a
computer process. For example, even if verifying an identity is required and
such verification is done manually, the issuing CA at least needs to be able
to read the data structure it received by email as part of the process of
verifying an identity. Thus, we find that Kapidzic discloses “at said
computer process . . . verifying the authenticity of said request.” We also
find persuasive Petitioner’s argument that, at least some of the time, manual
intervention would not be required. We find this argument particularly
persuasive in light of Kapidzic’s disclosure in Section 8 that the integration
of signing and storage/retrieval protocols “opens the opportunity for the
CMS to fully automate the process of certificate retrieval and verification,
independent of any other system,” and that “CMS UAs provide APIs [7],
which enable different security enhanced applications to be easily interfaced
with the CMS, supplying them with verified certificates.” Ex. 1007, 11
(emphasis added). In fact, that disclosure in Kapidzic appears to indicate
that Kapidzic contemplates an entirely automated certificate management
system, such that every process disclosed by Kapidzic, not just the

25

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
processes relied upon by Petitioner for disclosing the subject matter recited
in the challenged claims, could be done at a computer process.
Claim 19 depends from claim 18 and further recites “storing the
received signed certificate at said requesting computer process.” Claim 21
depends from claim 18 and recites performing the method of claim 18
“when adding a new entity to a certification infrastructure, which entity may
be [a] policy certification authority, certification authority, application[,] or
end-user.” Petitioner points to Kapidzic’s disclosure of storing the received
certificate (Pet. 11–12 (quoting Ex. 1007, 8)) and performing the method of
claim 18 when registering a new CA (Pet. 12–13 (quoting Ex. 1007, 7)).
Patent Owner only argues that claims 19 and 21, which depend from claim
18, are patentable for the same reasons as argued with respect to claim 18.
PO Resp. 25, 26. For the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 18, 19, and
21 are anticipated by Kapidzic.
d. Claim 20
Claim 20 depends from claim 18 and further recites “storing the
received signed certificate or copy of a signed certificate at a common
certificate repository.” Petitioner points to the X.500 directories as meeting
the common repository because Kapidzic discloses that the X.500 directories
may be used “for storage and distribution of certificates.” Pet. 12 (quoting
Ex. 1007, 5); see also Ex. 1007, 11. Patent Owner argues Kapidzic does not
disclose a common certificate repository, because Kapidzic discloses storing
certificates in multiple locations. PO Resp. 25–26.
As discussed above, we do not agree with Patent Owner’s proposed
construction of a common certificate repository. We agree with Petitioner

26

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
that the X.500 directories may serve as a repository for multiple certificates
within a hierarchy and, therefore, meet the plain and ordinary meaning of a
common certificate repository. Therefore, we find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 20 is
anticipated by Kapidzic.
e. Claim 22
Claim 22 depends from claim 18 and further recites performing the
method of claim 18 “upon expiration of an existing certificate, where the
new certificate may contain either the existing or a new public key.” Ex.
1004, 19:6220:7. Petitioner argues that a skilled artisan would have
understood the expiration of keys to result in expiration of a certificate and,
thus, performing the method of claim 18 upon expiration of a certificate is
disclosed. Pet. 13 (citing Ex. 1001 ¶¶ 95–99). Patent Owner argues that
Kapidzic discloses performing the process that Petitioner maps to the subject
matter of claim 18 “when a current pair of keys expires,” not when the
certificate expires. PO Resp. 26–27. Patent Owner argues expiration of
keys is not the same as the expiration of a certificate. Id. at 27.
We find persuasive Petitioner’s argument, supported by expert
testimony (Ex. 1001 ¶ 97), that the expiration of keys results in the
expiration of a certificate and, thus, that the disclosed method would be
performed upon expiration of an existing certificate. Therefore, we find
Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim
22 is anticipated by Kapidzic.
f. Claims 23–27
Kapidzic discloses a CA sending a “Certificate Reply” message
“contain[ing] the requested certificate as well as all the certificates in the

27

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
certificate verification path, up to the top of the hierarchy,” which Petitioner
maps to “obtaining a public key certificate for every computer process in the
infrastructure between the sender and a common point of trust in the
infrastructure,” as recited in independent claim 23. Pet. 8, 14 (citing Ex.
1007, 8). Kapidzic also discloses “verif[ying] the signatures of the
certificates from the message, starting from the PCA’s certificate” down to
the lowest level certificate in the message, which Petitioner maps to
“verifying the authenticity of signatures iteratively, beginning with the
common point of trust,” as recited in claim 23. Pet. 14–15 (citing Ex. 1007,
6, 8). The portions of Kapidzic cited by Petitioner explain that the
verification process, when requesting a certificate, is the same process used
when initially receiving a signed certificate. Ex. 1007, 8.
Patent Owner argues that Kapidzic does not explain how the
certificate “of a second user” that is being verified was received and, thus,
Kapidzic does not disclose verifying the certificate of a sender. PO Resp.
28–29. Patent Owner further argues that, because Kapidzic does not
disclose “processes,” claim 23 is not anticipated by Kapidzic. Id. at 29–30.
Petitioner argues that a process returning a Certificate Reply message in
response to a request renders that process a “sender,” and that it is the
certificates for that sender and for each process up the hierarchy to a
common point of trust that are being verified. Pet. 13–14.
We have already discussed above that Kapidzic discloses computer
processes generally. Moreover, as discussed above, the ’574 patent explains
that each of the entities in a hierarchy is associated with a process. Given
the context of how the ’574 patent informs a proper construction of
performing the recited steps at or by a computer process, we find

28

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
unpersuasive Patent Owner’s arguments that Kapidzic lacks processes or
that Kapidzic does not obtain public key certificates for each process. In
view of the disclosure of the ’574 patent, we find Kapidzic’s chain of
certificates returned to a requester meets the recited certificates for each
computer process.
Claims 24–27 depend from claim 23. Claim 24 further recites that “a
public key certificate for every computer process in the infrastructure
between the sender and a common point of trust is also verified against all
relevant certificate revocation lists.” Petitioner points to Kapidzic’s
disclosure of checking each certificate being verified against CRLs (Pet. 15
(quoting Ex. 1007, 10)). Patent Owner only argues that claim 24 is
patentable for the same reasons as argued with respect to claim 23. PO
Resp. 30. As discussed above, we find the scope of claims 25–27 to be the
same as claim 23. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner
has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 23–27 are
anticipated by Kapidzic.
g. Claims 28 and 29
Kapidzic discloses “[t]he certificate verification process must
therefore include a check that the otherwise seemingly valid certificate has
not been revoked.” Ex. 1007, 10. Kapidzic also discloses “check[ing] the
certificate against the current CRL of the same issuer” for every certificate
being verified. Id. Petitioner maps those disclosures of Kapidzic to the
method of validating a public key including using CRLs “of each computer
process between a computer process or user whose certificate is being
validated and a point of trust in common with the computer process or user
which is validating the certificate,” as recited in independent claim 28. Pet.

29

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
9, 17–19. Kapidzic also discloses storing CRLs for later use in verification
after retrieval of CRLs and obtaining CRLs if they are not available locally,
which Petitioner maps to “[t]he method of claim 28 in which retrieved
certificate revocation lists are stored locally in the computer at which the
certificate is being validated,” as recited in dependent claim 29. Id. at 19
(citing Ex. 1007, 10–11).
Patent Owner again argues that Kapidzic does not disclose computer
processes. PO Resp. 35–36. Patent Owner also asserts that Kapidzic merely
discloses checking each certificate against a current CRL of the same issuer.
Id. at 34–35. Patent Owner appears to argue that each certificate must be
checked against multiple CRLs. Id. Patent Owner only argues that claim
29, which depends from claim 28, is patentable for the same reasons as
argued with respect to claim 28. Id. at 36.
Petitioner argues Patent Owner’s assertion that each certificate must
be checked against multiple CRLs is based on a flawed construction of the
claim language. PO Resp. 16. Petitioner asserts that Patent Owner’s
implicit construction is not consistent with the specification of the ’574
patent, which explains that certificates are identified in CRLs by a unique
serial number generated by an issuer and, therefore, each certificate only
needs to be checked against the CRL of the CA that issued the respective
certificate. Id.
To the extent Patent Owner argues each certificate needs to be
checked against multiple CRLs, we agree with Petitioner that such implicit
construction is flawed. As discussed by Petitioner, the ’574 patent discloses
issuing CAs managing CRLs (and assigning the serial numbers used to
identify certificates in the CRLs). Thus, the appropriate construction of

30

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
claim 28 in light of the specification would include using the CRL created at
each CA to ensure that each certificate issued by that respective CA does not
appear on that CRL, i.e., the CRL retrieved from the respective issuing CA.
We have already addressed Patent Owner’s assertion that Kapidzic does not
disclose processes generally and find that each CRL is associated with a
particular CA and its processes. Therefore, we find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 28 and 29 are
anticipated by Kapidzic.
h. Claim 30
Kapidzic discloses that a new key pair may need to be generated when
the key expires or is believed to be compromised and that “[w]hen a new
key pair is generated by some CA, the same procedure is followed as in the
original certification.” Ex. 1007, 9. Kapidzic also discloses that “[a]fter reissuance of a CA’s certificate, the whole certification sub-hierarchy
underneath that CA becomes invalidated” such that the CA needs to re-sign
all certificates it has issued with its new key and inform its subordinates of
the change so that the entire sub-hierarchy can be updated iteratively. Id. at
10–11. Petitioner maps those disclosures of Kapidzic to the method of
updating certificates recited in independent claim 30. Pet. 9, 19–22 (citing
Ex. 1007, 5, 8–11); 1410 Pet. 6–28.
As an initial matter with respect to claim 30, we briefly address Patent
Owner’s argument that we “consolidate[d] IBM’s proceedings to cure IBM’s
deficient earlier Petition,” and that such consolidation was an “improper”
exercise of our discretion to consolidate matters. PO Resp. 36–40. We
exercised our discretion to consolidate Case No. IPR2014-01410 with the
instant proceeding in order “[t]o administer the proceedings more

31

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
efficiently,” which we are authorized to do under 35 U.S.C. § 315(d). 1410
Dec. on Inst. 13. Furthermore, as evidenced by our institution of review of
claim 30 based on the Petition, we found there were no deficiencies with
respect to claim 30 that needed to be “cured.” See Dec. on Inst.; see also Ex.
3001 (denying authorization for Petitioner to correct its petition after the
Preliminary Response was filed, and informing the parties that we would
consider the Petition as filed).
Substantively, Patent Owner argues that Kapidzic does not disclose
several of the steps of claim 30. For clarity, to analyze these arguments we
provide an explanation of how the method of claim 30 is performed using a
simple exemplary infrastructure wherein process A has subordinate
processes M and N, and process M has subordinate processes X and Y. In
this example, M is the recited “first computer process,” A is the recited
“computer process which is authorized to issue the new signed certificate,”
and X and Y are the recited “subordinate computer processes [of process
M].” In this example, therefore, M “possesses a certificate[] to be updated.”
According to the process recited in claim 30, M’s certificate is updated by
“receiving a new signed certificate [MC2] from” A, and revoking M’s
“current certificate [MC1] previously used for verification of certificates of”
X and Y. The receiving step is not disputed by Patent Owner as being
disclosed by Kapidzic.
Patent Owner argues that, even though Kapidzic discloses revoking a
certificate when its keys change, Kapidzic does not disclose the next step—
revoking certificates that were previously used for verification—because no
reference to revoking certificates in Kapidzic explicitly states that the
certificate to be revoked was used to verify certificates of subordinate

32

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
computers. PO Resp. 40–41. Patent Owner’s argument is unpersuasive.
Kapidzic discloses revoking a certificate that was used to verify subordinate
processes’ certificates. In fact, in Patent Owner’s subsequent argument, it
cites one of the passages in Kapidzic explaining that changing keys of a CA
“affects the certification hierarchy, since all certificates of direct
subordinates have been signed with the old secret key.” PO Resp. 42
(quoting Ex. 1007, 9 (emphasis added)). In our example, that passage of
Kapidzic discloses that, prior to revocation of M’s current certificate (MC1),
certificates of M’s direct subordinates, X and Y, “have been signed with”
MC1. Thus, when revoking MC1, Kapidzic discloses revoking a certificate
that was previously used for verification.
The next recited step is “issuing new certificates [XC2 and YC2] to all
subordinate computer processes [X and Y, respectively] for which
certificates had been previously signed by the first computer process [M].”
Patent Owner does not appear to dispute that Kapidzic discloses this step of
claim 30. Regardless, Petitioner points to Kapidzic’s disclosure of the
process that occurs in response to updating keys in a certificate. Pet. 21
(quoting Ex. 1007, 8–10); 1410 Pet. 12. In particular, Petitioner points to
the explanation in Kapidzic of sending “Certificate Re-Sign” messages using
the same format as the “Certificate Signature Reply” messages. Pet. 21;
1410 Pet. 12. We agree that Kapidzic discloses the recited step of issuing
new certificates to subordinate processes.
The next recited steps, which Patent Owner argues are not disclosed
by Kapidzic, are “copying to all subordinate computer processes the new
certificate to be used for verification of new subordinate certificates” and
iteratively distributing new certificates. PO Resp. 41–44. Patent Owner

33

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
argues claim 30 recites copying a newly issued certificate (which is used to
verify subordinate computers’ certificates) to the subordinate computers,
whereas Kapidzic discloses using the newly-issued certificate to certify new
certificates for each of its subordinate computers that are copied to each
respective subordinate computer and will, in turn, be used by those
subordinates to certify each of their subordinate computers’ certificates. PO
Resp. 42–43. Patent Owner argues the recited “iteratively performing the
distribution” step also relates to distributing the newly signed certificate,
which we refer to in this example as MC2. We agree with Patent Owner
regarding the disclosure of Kapidzic. We disagree, however, with Patent
Owner’s implicit claim construction, which we find inconsistent with what
the ’574 patent discloses.
In our example, Patent Owner argues that claim 30 requires copying
MC2 (M’s newly issued certificate) to each of its subordinate processes, X
and Y (and iteratively to further subordinate processes of X and Y). A
review of the claim, in light of the specification, leads us to a different
construction. Continuing with our example, we construe the claim to require
copying XC2 to X and copying YC2 to Y. Initially, looking at the language
of the claim, we note that step “a.1” recites “receiving a new signed
certificate [MC2],” and step “a.3” recites “issuing new certificates [XC2 and
YC2] to all subordinate computer processes.” Ex. 1007, 20:51–58
(emphasis added). The disputed copying step recites “copying to all
subordinate computer processes the new certificate to be used for
verification.” Id. at 20:59–61 (emphasis added). Thus, the claim language
refers back to the “new certificates” (i.e., XC2 and YC2) rather than
referring to the “new signed certificate” (i.e., MC2), supporting a

34

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
construction that “the new certificate” being copied to a subordinate
computer process is a respective new certificate that is “to be used” by that
process to verify its subordinate processes’ certificates.
Moreover, a review of the processes described in the ’574 patent
supports this construction. Ex. 1004, Figs. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 14:24–53,
15:4–32, 15:44–58. Specifically, the “Update__CA” process described in
the ’574 patent, which invokes additional processes and sends various
messages, describes copying a newly issued certificate to each subordinate
computer process (through a “Certificate__Resign__Reply” message) so that
each respective subordinate computer process may use that certificate to
certify its subordinate computer processes. Id. The process may then repeat
if the subordinate computer process has its own subordinate computer
processes. Id. at 15:48–51. The process disclosed does not describe copying
a newly issued parent certificate (MC2 in our example) to one of its
subordinate computer processes (X and Y in our example). Therefore, we
are persuaded that Kapidzic discloses the recited copying and iterative
distribution steps.
Patent Owner also repeats its argument that Kapidzic does not teach
processes. Patent Owner’s argument regarding Kapidzic’s processes already
has been addressed above. Therefore, we find Petitioner has demonstrated,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 30 is anticipated by Kapidzic.
i. Claim 31
Kapidzic discloses establishing the CMS hierarchy in a top-down
manner. Ex. 1007, 7. Kapidzic discloses that establishment of a CA
includes two phases—registration and certification (the request for and
signing of a certificate discussed above in the section describing Kapidzic).

35

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Id. In order to register itself, a CA may provide a suggested “relative
distinguished name” and the name of its parent CA, which specifies its place
in the CMS hierarchy. Id. Upon receipt of that information, the PCA may
generate a unique distinguished name (DN) for the CA and “[t]he PCA
updates its local database with the CA’s DN, address and its position in the
hierarchy.” Id. Petitioner maps the disclosures of Kapidzic related to
registration of a CA to “adding a new component to a representation of a
certification infrastructure at a location indicative of where the said
computer process is to be added,” as recited in independent claim 31. Pet. 9,
23 (citing Ex. 1007, 7).
As part of the certification process in the CMS, Kapidzic discloses
that the parent CA verifies a request from a CA desiring certification, signs
the certificate, stores a local copy, and sends a reply with the signed
certificate back to the requesting CA. Ex. 1007, 8. Kapidzic also discloses
that the requesting CA verifies the signatures of the certificates from the
reply message (including its own requested certificate) and stores the
certificates in a local database. Id. Petitioner maps those disclosures to
“creating entries in a certificate storage database at least at both said new
computer process and at the computer process authorized to certify the said
new process,” and “obtaining a signed certificate for the said new computer
process from said computer process authorized to certify the new process
and storing it at the said new computer process,” as recited in independent
claim 31. Pet. 23–25 (citing Ex. 1007, 7, 8).
Patent Owner argues only that Kapidzic does not disclose that CAs or
other CMS components are processes. For the reasons discussed in the
claim construction section, we find Kapidzic discloses computer processes.

36

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Moreover, we find that those processes are associated with the various CMS
entities or components and that the portions of Kapidzic pointed to by
Petitioner disclose the recited steps of claim 31. Therefore, we find
Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim
31 is anticipated by Kapidzic.
2. Anticipation of Claims 23–25, 27, and 28 by PKI Report and
Obviousness of Claims 18–22, 26, and 29–31 over PKI Report
Petitioner asserts claims 18–31 are unpatentable as anticipated by, or
obvious in view of, PKI Report, and provides a chart showing where PKI
Report allegedly discloses or teaches each limitation. Pet. 25–43. As
described below, we conclude that Petitioner has met its burden to show, by
a preponderance of the evidence, as required by 35 U.S.C. § 316(e), that
claims 18–30 are unpatentable as anticipated by, or obvious in view of, PKI
Report. We further conclude, however, that Petitioner has not met its burden
to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 31 is unpatentable
as obvious in view of PKI Report.
a. PKI Report (Ex. 1008)
PKI Report is the result of a study requested by the NIST (National
Institute of Standards and Technology) and conducted by the MITRE
Corporation to study “alternatives for automated management of public keys
and of the associated public key certificates for the Federal Government.”
Ex. 1008, 5, 6 (emphasis added). PKI Report addresses issues of a public
key infrastructure (PKI) for automatically managing public keys using
public key certificates. Id. at 6. PKI Report includes user and technical
“requirements that relate to the generation and distribution of keys, to the
obtaining of public key certificates and to the distribution of” CRLs. Id.

37

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
The entities within the PKI may be arranged in a hierarchical structure. Id.
at 7.
The PKI described in PKI Report may be used for encrypting
messages to ensure confidentiality, but the focus of PKI Report is verifying
the sender of a message. Ex. 1008, 18. In order to verify the signature on a
message, a recipient must be confident in the integrity of the public key used
to decrypt the signed message. Id. at 18, 22. The verifier may have
confidence in the integrity of the key used to decrypt a message “because it
was manually delivered [or the verifier] obtained it from a certificate signed
by an entity for which he holds a public key he trusts.” Id. at 22. Thus, the
verifier must hold a chain of trusted keys back to a common point of trust,
for which the verifier obtained a key “in a trusted ‘out-of-band’ manner.”
Id. This chain of trust is called a certification path (id. at 23) and allows for
a hierarchical system of validating a certificate by starting with the common
point of trust and iteratively obtaining the key at the next level until the
sender’s certificate may be verified using the issuing CA’s key. Id. at 22,
23. In particular, a “certification path is a sequence of CAs, the first being a
CA for which the verifier holds a trusted copy of the public key and the last
being the CA that issued the certificate certifying the needed PKI entity’s
public key.” Id. at 23.
Recognizing that keys in global systems may originate from anywhere
in the world, PKI Report studied alternatives for establishing an automated
system to manage and distribute keys electronically, namely a PKI. Ex.
1008, 19. The purposes of the desired PKI include generating public key
certificates binding the identity of users to their public keys, providing users

38

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
with easy access to other users’ certificates, and providing users with timely
information regarding revocation of certificates. Id.
b. Claims 18–22
Petitioner argues PKI Report describes various embodiments but that
the various embodiments contain “complementary architectures and methods
for managing public key certificates, such that one having ordinary skill in
the art would be motivated to combine their teachings,” and that developing
a single infrastructure using the desired aspects was the point of the study
that resulted in PKI Report. Pet. 27 (citing Ex. 1001, ¶¶ 186189). Dr.
Blaze explains that PKI Report “examined the disclosed standards to
develop the PKI infrastructure,” such that “PKI Report can be readily
combined with the disclosed standards used to develop the PKI Report.” Ex.
1001 ¶ 189. We have reviewed PKI Report, Dr. Blaze’s testimony, and the
combinations proposed in Petitioner’s challenges. On this record, we are
persuaded that Petitioner’s rationale for combining the various embodiments
is reasonable.
PKI Report explains that a goal of the study is to “design [a public
key] infrastructure that will allow users to establish chains of trust” and “to
facilitate trusted electronic correspondence beyond those users with whom
one has manually exchanged public keys.” Ex. 1008, 23. PKI Report
“addresses the issues related to a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which will
automatically manage public keys through the use of public key
certificates.” Id. at 6. PKI Report describes a process for a user or CA to
obtain a public key certificate including sending a self-signed request
including the public key to an issuing CA and the issuing CA verifying the
signature on the request, generating and signing a certificate using its private

39

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
key, and sending the signed certificate back to the requester. Id. at 125.
Petitioner maps those disclosures of PKI Report to the method of requesting
and issuing a public key certificate recited in independent claim 18. Pet. 25–
26, 28–29 (citing Ex. 1008, 6, 23, 62, 125).
Patent Owner argues PKI Report does not disclose that the
components of the certification infrastructure are processes, and that
certification according to PKI Report requires manual intervention. PO
Resp. 47–49. Petitioner argues that Patent Owner’s argument is based on an
improper construction because the claim does not recite that a process
verifies an identity, but rather requires verifying authenticity of a request.
Reply 14. Petitioner also asserts that, although not required by claim 18,
PKI Report does disclose verifying an identity using a computer process
because PKI Report discloses verifying user identity using a smart card,
which would require the use of a computer process.
For the reasons discussed above with respect to the disclosure of the
’574 patent, our construction of computer process, and the disclosure of PKI
Report, we find PKI Report discloses using computer processes as part of
the certification infrastructure. As disclosed by PKI Report, one point of the
study was to establish an automated system for managing and distributing
keys electronically. Ex. 1008, 19. Moreover, PKI report generally discloses
that CAs (or other entities) generate keys and verify and certify
subordinates’ certificates. Id. at 62. These disclosures of executing
procedures regarding the generation and analysis of electronic data
structures involve the use of computer processes. See, e.g., id. (“it was
assumed that the user had either software or hardware that was capable of
generating the key pair for the user”). As discussed above, the relevant

40

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
inquiry is whether PKI Report teaches using the computer processes as
recited in the challenged claims.
Regarding claim 18, we agree with Petitioner that verifying identity
using a smart card would be done at a computer process. Reply 15 (citing
Ex. 1032 ¶¶ 8–9). Moreover, we agree that the claim does not recite that a
computer process verifies an identity, but rather that a computer process is
used to verify authenticity of a request. See Reply 14. PKI Report discloses
that a CA “verifies the subject’s signature on both the certificate and the
encapsulated text.” Ex. 1008, 62, 125. This verification meets the recited
step of “at said computer process . . . verifying the authenticity of said
request,” because any verification of the electronic signature and
encapsulated text involves the use of a computer process.
Petitioner also provides arguments mapping various disclosures of
PKI Report to the additional limitations recited in claims 19–22, which
depend from claim 18. Pet. 29–31 (citing Ex. 1008, 51, 62, 64, 67, 113).
Patent Owner only argues claim 19 is patentable for the same reasons argued
with respect to claim 18. PO Resp. 49–50.
Patent Owner asserts claim 20 is patentable because PKI Report
teaches each CA depositing certificates at different directory servers, which
is the opposite of a common repository. Id. at 50 (citing Ex. 1008, 50).
Patent Owner’s argument, however, is directed to a portion of PKI Report
discussing backup servers – i.e., the existence of multiple directory servers
to increase system reliability in case one directory server goes down. See
Ex. 1008, 50. That same section explains that a system employing a “hot
backup,” which holds “exactly the same information as the primary server,”
might have only one (replicated) repository for certificates. Id. Thus, even

41

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
under Patent Owner’s proposed construction, PKI Report discloses a
common repository. Moreover, even assuming that two directory servers are
not identical, PKI report teaches that each directory server could hold
multiple certificates and would therefore meet the broadest reasonable
construction of the recited common repository.
Patent Owner argues Petitioner has not established that the
certification process recited in claim 18 is performed when adding a new
entity to the infrastructure, as recited in claim 21. Patent Owner argues
claim 22, which depends from claim 21, is patentable for the same reasons
as asserted with respect to claim 21. Petitioner asserts PKI Report teaches
that new CAs may be required for different reasons, that an entity may
request to have its public key certified, and that addition of a new CA
requires certification. Pet. 28–30; Reply 17–18 (citing Ex. 1001 ¶ 216). We
are persuaded by Petitioner’s argument.
Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the subject matter of
claims 18–22 would have been obvious in view of PKI Report.
c. Claims 23–27
As mentioned above, a PKI Report certification path includes each
CA in the path between the sender and the common point of trust. Ex. 1008,
23. Based on those disclosures, Petitioner maps the receipt of the
certification path to “obtaining a public key certificate for every computer
process in the infrastructure between the sender and a common point of trust
in the infrastructure,” as recited in claim 23. Pet. 32–33. PKI Report further
discloses verifying each certificate in the path, starting with the certificate
signed by the common point of trust and iteratively using the decrypted key

42

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
to verify the certificate at the next lower level in the hierarchy until the
certificate of the CA that signed the sender’s certificate is verified. Ex.
1008, 63–34. Petitioner maps that disclosure of PKI Report to “verifying the
authenticity of signatures iteratively, beginning with the common point of
trust,” as recited in claim 23. Pet. 33 (citing Ex. 1008, 23, 63–64).
Patent Owner argues PKI Report does not anticipate claim 23 because
PKI Report does not teach that CAs are processes and only teaches obtaining
“one or more” additional certificates to verify a sender’s certificate. PO
Resp. 51–52. We do not agree with Patent Owner regarding its assertion
about processes for the reasons already discussed above. We also are not
persuaded by Patent Owner’s assertions that PKI Report’s disclosure of
obtaining “one or more” additional certificates does not meet the recited step
of obtaining a certificate for every process between the sender and the
common point of trust.
First, in the simple case where there are no intervening processes
between the sender and the common point of trust, PKI Report explicitly
indicates that it would obtain a certificate for every process. Second, it is
clear from the context that the reference in PKI Report to the possible need
for a recipient to “obtain one or more additional certificates . . . in order to
verify the signature on the sender’s certificate” is a general statement that
the sender’s certificate (unless it is the common point of trust) will not be
enough to verify the signature on the sender’s certificate. Ex. 1008, 63. PKI
Report explains that a certification path includes every process between the
sender and a common point of trust and that, a recipient receives a
certification path along with a signed document and must obtain all
certificates within the certification path. Id. at 23, 63–64.

43

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Claims 24–27 depend from claim 23. Claim 24 further recites that “a
public key certificate for every computer process in the infrastructure
between the sender and a common point of trust is also verified against all
relevant certificate revocation lists.” Petitioner points to PKI Report’s
disclosure of checking each certificate being verified against CRLs. Pet. 34
(quoting Ex. 1008, 63). Patent Owner only argues that claim 24 is
patentable for the same reasons as argued with respect to claim 23. PO
Resp. 52. As discussed above, we find the scope of claims 25–27 to be the
same as claim 23. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner
has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 23–25
and 27 are anticipated by, and claim 26 would have been obvious6 in view
of, PKI Report.
d. Claims 28 and 29
PKI Report discloses checking each certificate against the appropriate
CRL before using it, which Petitioner maps to the method of validating a
public key certificate using CRLs, as recited in claim 28. Pet. 35–36 (citing
Ex. 1008, 6, 23, 63). PKI Report also discloses that a user may store CRLs
locally, which Petitioner maps to “retrieved certificate revocation lists are
stored locally in the computer at which the certificate is being validated,” as
recited in dependent claim 29. Id. at 37 (citing Ex. 1008, 165).

6

Petitioner challenged claim 26 as obvious in view of PKI Report. Because
we determine it is of the same scope as claim 23, and we find claim 23 is
anticipated by PKI Report, it follows that claim 23 would have been obvious
in view of PKI Report. See, e.g., Cohesive Techs., Inc. v. Waters Corp., 543
F.3d 1351, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (explaining distinctions between
anticipation and obviousness, but noting that “prior art references that
anticipate a claim will usually render that claim obvious”).
44

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
With respect to claim 28, Patent Owner argues PKI Report does not
disclose that CAs or other certification infrastructure components are
processes, so it does not disclose using CRLs “of each computer process.”
PO Resp. 55. PKI Report discloses that each CA is responsible for
generating CRLs for all of the certificates it issues and, as Petitioner argues,
PKI Report discloses checking appropriate CRLs. Pet. 36; see Ex. 1008, 23,
40–41, 63, 66. PKI Report discusses various ways of storing and retrieving
CRLs, but regardless of the chosen implementation, a CRL associated with a
PKI Report CA meets the recited limitation of a CRL of a computer process
because the processes executing the CA function are the processes that
would create and maintain the CRL associated with that CA. Thus, because
each CA has an associated CRL and every certificate between the sender and
a common point of trust is verified against an appropriate CRL, it follows
that PKI Report discloses checking the CRL for each process between the
sender and a common point of trust. See Ex. 1008, 23, 40–41, 63, 66.
Patent Owner argues only that claim 29, which depends from claim
28, is patentable for at least the same reasons as asserted with respect to
claim 28. PO Resp. 55. For the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner
has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 28 is
anticipated by PKI Report and the subject matter of claim 29 would have
been obvious in view of PKI Report.
e. Claim 30
PKI Report’s disclosure of iteratively updating certificates is similar
to the iterative update procedure disclosed in Kapidzic and the ’574 patent.
Specifically, PKI Report recognizes that certificates may expire or become
compromised, resulting in revocation of certificates, which will require the

45

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
entities to generate new keys and request new signed certificates from an
issuing CA. Pet. 39–40; Ex. 1008, 65–66. PKI Report also recognizes the
need for a CA with a compromised key to reissue all certificates it generated
using its new key. Pet. 40; Ex. 1008, 66. Thus, for each subordinate CA,
the process would be repeated until all subordinates in the hierarchy were
updated. Petitioner maps those disclosures to the method of updating
certificates recited in claim 30. Pet. 26, 37–40 (citing Ex. 1008, 23, 63, 65–
66, 125).
Patent Owner argues claim 30 is patentable over PKI Report for
essentially the same reasons asserted with respect to the challenge based on
Kapidzic – i.e., PKI Report does not disclose processes and PKI Report does
not disclose copying to all subordinate processes the new certificate. PO
Resp. 55–57.
For the same reasons discussed above, we disagree with Patent
Owner’s implicit construction of claim 30. We find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 30 is
anticipated by PKI Report.
f. Claim 31
Petitioner maps PKI Report’s disclosure of adding new CAs to the
hierarchy, and storing certificates at both an issuing CA and the entity (a
user or CA) that requested a signed certificate, to the method of adding a
new process to the infrastructure recited in claim 31. Pet. 26–27, 40–43
(citing Ex. 1008, 6, 23, 44–45, 50–51, 69, 113, 125). Petitioner points to
Figures 4-2 and 7-1 of PKI Report, which depict a hierarchy similar to the
hierarchy depicted in Figure 1A of the ’574 patent, and asserts those figures
are logical representations of PKI Report’s certification infrastructure.

46

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Reply 18. Patent Owner argues PKI Report teaches adding a PCA and new
CAs but does not teach “adding a new component to a representation of a
certification infrastructure,” as recited in claim 31. PO Resp. 58–59.
We agree with Petitioner that the hierarchy shown in the figures of
PKI Report depicts a hierarchy similar to that shown in the ’574 patent.
Nonetheless, Petitioner merely points to a figure that explains the
arrangement of the infrastructure disclosed by PKI Report. Petitioner does
not point to anything in PKI Report that teaches or suggests adding a
component to a representation of the certification infrastructure as part of
the method of adding the component to the infrastructure. Therefore, on this
record, we find Petitioner has not demonstrated, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the subject matter of claim 31 would have been obvious in
view of PKI Report.
3. Anticipation of Claim 18 by RFC 1424, Anticipation of Claims
23–29 by RFC 1422, and Obviousness of Claims 19–22, and 31
over RFC 1422 and RFC 1424
Petitioner asserts claims 18–29 and 31 are unpatentable as anticipated
by RFC 1424 or RFC 1422, or as obvious in view of the combination of
RFC 1422 and RFC 1424, supported by a chart showing where RFC 1422
and RFC 1424 allegedly teach or disclose each limitation. Pet. 43–61. As
described below, we conclude that Petitioner has met its burden to show, by
a preponderance of the evidence, as required by 35 U.S.C. § 316(e), that
claims 18–29 and 31 are unpatentable as anticipated by RFC 1422 or RFC
1424, or obvious in view of the combination of RFC 1422 and RFC 1424.
a. RFC 1422 (Ex. 1011) and RFC 1424 (Ex. 1013)
RFC 1422 and RFC 1424 are two “of a series of documents defining
privacy enhancement mechanisms for electronic mail transferred using

47

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Internet mail protocols.” Ex. 1011, 1. Specifically, RFC 1422 “defines a
supporting key management architecture and infrastructure, based on publickey certificate techniques, to provide keying information to message
originators and recipients,” and RFC 1424 describes “key certification,
certificate revocation list (CRL) storage, and CRL retrieval.” Id.;
Ex. 1013, 1.
b. Combination of RFC 1422 and RFC 1424
Petitioner asserts that an ordinarily skilled artisan would have
combined RFC 1422 and RFC 1424 because the two documents “were
published by the same working group of the Internet Engineering Task
Force, are different parts of the same standard for Privacy Enhancement for
Internet Electronic Mail, cite each other, and discuss being used together.”
Pet. 44–45. Moreover, RFC 1424 states that its services are required by
RFC 1422. Id. at 45 (citing Ex. 1013, 1). We have reviewed RFC 1422 and
RFC 1424 and the combinations proposed in Petitioner’s challenges, and we
are persuaded that Petitioner’s rationale for combining RFC 1422 with RFC
1424 is reasonable.
c. Claims 18–22
Petitioner asserts claim 18 is anticipated by RFC 1424 and the subject
matter of claims 19–22, which depend from claim 18, would have been
obvious over a combination of RFC1422 and RFC 1424. Pet. 43, 46–47,
53–55.
RFC 1424 discloses a requester sending a certification request, which
includes a “public key in the form of a self-signed certificate,” to a
certification authority service that is higher in the infrastructure hierarchy
than the requester. Ex. 1013, 2–3. RFC 1424 further discloses that the

48

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
certification authority service verifies the signature of the self-signed
certificate, signs the certificate and sends the signed certificate back to the
requester in a reply message, which “includes a certification path.” Id. at 3.
Petitioner maps those disclosures of RFC 1424 to the method of requesting
and issuing a certificate, as recited in claim 18. Pet. 46–48 (citing Ex. 1013,
2, 3).
Patent Owner argues that RFC 1424 uses emails to send certificates
and certification requests and that the Petition does not explain how the
emails of RFC 1424 could be automatically processed “to teach or suggest
the process-based limitations.” PO Resp. 60–61. Patent Owner asserts that
RFC 1424 does not describe CAs as processes, and that a skilled artisan
would understand that manual intervention is necessary. Id. at 61.
As with Kapidzic and PKI Report, Petitioner argues that RFC 1422
and RFC 1424 disclose computer processes, notwithstanding the fact that
RFC 1422 and RFC 1424 describe processes that may involve manual
intervention. Reply 12–13. As with Kapidzic and PKI Report, we agree
with Petitioner that RFC 1422 and RFC 1424 disclose computer processes,
and we focus on whether the references disclose or teach the recited steps
are performed at a computer process. Similar to our analysis of claim 18
with respect to Kapidzic and PKI Report, we find that RFC 1424 describes
computer processes performing the recited steps of generating and sending a
data structure and verifying, certifying, and returning the data structure.
Claims 19–22 depend from claim 18. Petitioner provides arguments
mapping RFC 1422 to the additional limitations recited in claims 19–22.
Pet. 53–55 (citing Ex. 1011, 4, 8, 11–12). Patent Owner argues claims 19–
22 are patentable for the same reasons as asserted with respect to claim 18.

49

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
PO Resp. 68–70. Patent Owner also asserts claim 20 is patentable because
RFC 1422 does not teach a common repository. PO Resp. 69. We find that
the directory servers disclosed in RFC 1422 are used to store multiple
certificates and, therefore, meet our construction of a common repository.
Thus, for the reasons discussed, we find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that claim 18 is anticipated by RFC 1424 and
that the subject matter of claims 19–22 would have been obvious in view of
RFC 1422 and RFC 1424.
d. Claims 23–27
Petitioner asserts claims 23–27 are anticipated by RFC 1422. Pet. 43–
44, 48–51. RFC 1422 explains that its key management architecture is
compatible with the existing authentication framework described by the
X.509 standard. Ex. 1011, 1. RFC 1422 discloses that a message may
include a full certification path so that the recipient can validate a PCA
certificate and, using the key from each validated certificate, iteratively
move down the certification path until the certificate for the sender of the
message is validated. Id. at 25. Petitioner maps those disclosures to the
method of verifying a signed data structure, as recited in independent claim
23. Pet. 48–49 (citing Ex. 1011, 1, 25).
Petitioner points to portions of RFC 1422 explaining that a recipient
receives a full certification path, which has been described as every entity
between the sender and a common point of trust. Pet. 48–49 (citing Ex.
1011, 25). Petitioner also argues RFC 1422 discloses iteratively validating a
certificate for each entity in the certification path. Id.
Patent Owner argues RFC 1422 does not disclose CAs are processes,
and that RFC 1422 discloses manual intervention such that validation is

50

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
performed by a person, not a process. PO Resp. 62–65. Patent Owner also
asserts that RFC 1422 does not teach obtaining a certificate for every
process in the infrastructure. Id. at 65.
We agree with Petitioner’s arguments. Moreover, as discussed above,
the disclosed processes, which involve electronic messages and certificates,
are of the type that computer processes would have been used in those steps.
Thus, we agree with Petitioner that RFC 1422 discloses performing the
recited method steps at a computer process.
Claims 24–27 depend from claim 23. Claim 24 further recites that “a
public key certificate for every computer process in the infrastructure
between the sender and a common point of trust is also verified against all
relevant certificate revocation lists.” Petitioner points to portions of RFC
1422 that disclose checking each certificate against a CRL from the
certificate’s issuer. Pet. 49 (quoting Ex. 1011, 27). Patent Owner only
argues that claim 24 is patentable for the same reasons as argued with
respect to claim 23. PO Resp. 52. As discussed above, we find the scope of
claims 25–27 to be the same as claim 23. Thus, for the reasons discussed
above, we find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that claims 23–27 are anticipated by RFC 1422.
e. Claims 28 and 29
Petitioner asserts claims 28 and 29 are anticipated by RFC 1422. Pet.
44, 51–53. RFC 1422 discloses that “[e]ach certificate also must be checked
against the current CRL from the certificate’s issuer to ensure that revoked
certificates are not employed,” which Petitioner maps to the method of
validating a public key certificate using CRLs, as recited in claim 28. Id. at
51–52 (citing Ex. 1011, 1, 2, 27). RFC 1422 also discloses that a user may

51

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
store locally CRLs from any of the various levels of CAs, which Petitioner
maps to “retrieved certificate revocation lists are stored locally in the
computer at which the certificate is being validated,” as recited in claim 29.
Id. at 52–53 (citing Ex. 1011, 13).
Patent Owner argues RFC 1422 does not disclose processes and, thus,
does not disclose checking CRLs of each computer process in the
certification path. PO Resp. 67–68. We disagree.
As discussed above, RFC 1422 discloses that each CA keeps a CRL
for all revoked certificates that it has issued, and we interpret the CRL
associated with each CA to be a CRL of the process executing the CA
functions. Therefore, we find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that claims 28 and 29 are anticipated by RFC
1422.
f. Claim 31
Petitioner asserts the subject matter of claim 31 would have been
obvious in view of RFC 1422 and RFC 1424. Pet. 44, 58–61. Patent Owner
argues the combination of RFC 1422 and RFC 1424 does not teach adding a
new component to a representation of a certification infrastructure.
RFC 1424 discloses a process for an entity to obtain a signed
certificate from a certification authority above it in the hierarchy. Ex. 1013,
2–3. RFC 1422 discloses a general hierarchy for a PKI, including PCAs,
CAs, and users. Ex. 1011, 3. RFC 1422 further discloses that both user
entities and CAs may store certificates and CRLs in order to allow for
operation without common repositories. Id. at 12, 22. Petitioner maps those
disclosures of RFC 1422 and RFC 1424 to the method of adding a new

52

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
process to the infrastructure, as recited in claim 31. Pet. 58–60 (citing Ex.
1011, 1, 3, 12, 16, 22; Ex. 1013, 2).
Petitioner also argues that the directory tree is a representation of the
infrastructure and that adding a CA (or other entity) involves adding that
entity to the directory tree. Pet. 58–59; Reply 19–20. RFC 1422 explains
that a node (e.g., CA) has a “DN [distinguished name] subordination
requirement,” and that CAs “are syntactically constrained to refer to
subordinate entities in the X.500 directory information tree (DIT).” Ex.
1011, 16. Thus, we agree that RFC 1422 teaches adding a new component
to a representation of the infrastructure. Therefore, we find Petitioner has
demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject matter of
claim 31 would have been obvious in view of the combination of RFC 1422
and RFC 1424.
C. Motions to Exclude
1. Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude Evidence
Patent Owner moves to exclude, under 37 C.F.R. § 42.64(c), Exhibits
1033 and 1034, and paragraphs 6, 7, 13, and 14 of Exhibit 1032. Paper 39.
Patent Owner submits that Exhibits 1033 and 1034 have little or no
probative value, significantly confuse the issues, and are irrelevant because
they are the basis for new obviousness analysis that improperly modifies
Petitioner’s anticipation or obviousness challenges set out in the Petition. Id.
at 8–9; see also id. at 1–7. Patent Owner argues paragraphs 6, 7, 13, and 14
of Exhibit 1032 (Dr. Matthew Blaze’s Responsive Declaration) should be
excluded because the probative value of that testimony is outweighed by the
dangers of unfair prejudice and confusing the issues. Patent Owner further
argues that the additional testimony conflates obviousness analysis with

53

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
anticipation analysis, and improperly adds a reference to certain obviousness
challenges. Id. at 8–9.
Petitioner argues that paragraphs 6, 7, 13, and 14 of Dr. Blaze’s
Responsive Declaration merely respond to Patent Owner’s argument
regarding how an ordinarily skilled artisan would have understood certain
prior art disclosures, and asserts that Exhibits 1033 and 1034 are merely
evidence to support Dr. Blaze’s opinion. Paper 51, 1.
We are capable of discerning whether Petitioner’s arguments in its
Reply, and the evidence submitted in support thereof, were necessitated by
Patent Owner’s arguments, or whether such arguments constitute new
evidence. We are further able to determine whether Petitioner’s reference to
additional documents improperly changes the scope of its anticipation or
obviousness arguments, and are capable of giving Petitioner’s arguments
and evidence appropriate weight. Therefore, there is no danger of unfair
prejudice or confusing the issues. Moreover, in this case, we agree with
Petitioner that its submitted declaration and supporting evidence merely
respond to Patent Owner’s arguments regarding how a skilled artisan would
have understood certain disclosures in the references submitted in support of
the unpatentability arguments in the Petition. We have not considered the
content of these exhibits or declaration testimony to the extent that evidence
may go beyond merely providing context regarding how a skilled artisan
would have understood references in the previously-submitted evidence to
terms relating to X.509 standards. Accordingly, Patent Owner’s Motion to
Exclude is denied.

54

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
2. Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude Evidence
Petitioner moves to exclude, under 37 C.F.R. § 42.64(c), the entirety
of Exhibits 2007 (Dr. Chong’s Declaration) and 1030 (Transcript of Dr.
Chong’s Deposition). Paper 41.
Patent Owner responds that the objections were untimely, citing
37 C.F.R. § 42.64(b)(1), which requires that any objection to evidence
submitted during a trial must be served within five business days of service
of the evidence to which the objection is directed. Paper 49, 3–6. Petitioner
submits that no objection was served prior to Dr. Chong’s deposition
“because the unreliability and inadmissibility of his entire testimony only
become apparent upon cross-examination.” Paper 41, 1–2; Paper 53, 3–4.
Petitioner asserts that its objections to both the deposition testimony and the
declaration were, therefore, timely because Dr. Chong’s Declaration was the
subject “of his entire deposition testimony and is thus ‘deposition evidence’
under 37 C.F.R. § 42.64(a).” Paper 53, 4.
With respect to Dr. Chong’s Declaration, we disagree with
Petitioner’s characterization of that evidence as being “deposition evidence,”
and subject to objections under 37 C.F.R. § 42.64(a). Deposition evidence
does not include the underlying declaration.
Thus, objections to Dr. Chong’s Declaration are governed by
37 C.F.R. § 42.64(b)(2), which provides that a party relying on evidence to
which an objection is timely served may respond to the objection by serving
supplemental evidence within ten business days of service of the objection.
Dr. Chong’s Declaration appears to have been served on Petitioner on
February 6, 2015. PO Resp., Cert. of Serv. Petitioner argues it objected to
Dr. Chong’s Declaration on March 19, 2015, at the deposition of Dr. Chong.

55

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
Paper 41, 1–2; Paper 53, 3–4. That objection was almost six weeks after
Petitioner was served with the Declaration and, thus, nearly five weeks late.
Petitioner’s late objection to Dr. Chong’s Declaration was, thus, prejudicial
to Patent Owner because Patent Owner could have responded with
supplemental evidence to cure alleged deficiencies. Patent Owner’s Motion
to Exclude with respect to Exhibit 2007 is dismissed as untimely.
Because Dr. Chong’s Declaration (Ex. 2007) is not excluded from the
record, we find Dr. Chong’s deposition transcript is relevant to provide
context to, and assess the credibility of, Dr. Chong’s declaration testimony.
Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude Dr. Chong’s deposition testimony, submitted
in this proceeding as Ex. 1030, is denied.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we determine that Petitioner has
demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 18–31 of the
’574 patent are anticipated by Kapidzic, claims 23–25, 27, and 28 are
anticipated by PKI Report, claims 18–22, 26, 29, and 30 are unpatentable as
obvious over PKI Report, claim 18 is anticipated by RFC 1424, claims 23–
29 are anticipated by RFC 1422, and claims 19–22 and 31 are unpatentable
as obvious over RFC 1422 and RFC 1424.
IV. ORDER
Accordingly, it is:
ORDERED that claims 18–31 of the ’574 patent are determined to be
unpatentable;
FURTHER ORDERED that Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude
Evidence is denied;

56

IPR2014-00660
Patent 5,745,574
FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude Evidence
with respect to Exhibit 2007 is dismissed;
FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude Evidence
with respect to Exhibit 1030 is denied; and
FURTHER ORDERED that, because this is a Final Written Decision,
parties to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must
comply with the notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
