Patent 5,745,574
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
Compass Bank, Commerce Bancshares, Inc., and First National Bank
of Omaha (collectively, “Petitioner”) filed a petition requesting an inter
partes review of claims 18–31 (the “challenged claims”) of U.S. Patent No.
5,745,574 (Ex. 1002, “the ’574 patent”) under 35 U.S.C. §§ 311–319. Paper
1 (“Petition” or “Pet.”). On November 6, 2014, we instituted an inter partes
review of the challenged claims. Paper 12 (“Decision” or “Dec. on Inst.”).
Intellectual Ventures II LLC (“Patent Owner”) filed a Patent Owner
Response. Paper 19 (“PO Resp.”). Petitioner filed a Reply. Paper 29
(“Reply”). An oral hearing was held on June 11, 2015.1
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c), and this Final Written
Decision is issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73.
For the reasons that follow, we determine Petitioner has shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that claims 18–31 are unpatentable.
B. Related Proceedings
Petitioner indicates the ’574 patent is at issue in several district court
proceedings involving numerous parties. Pet. 1–2; Paper 11, 2–4. The ’574
patent also was the subject of inter partes review Case IPR2014-00660. Pet.
2; Paper 11, 4.
C. The ’574 Patent
The ’574 patent relates to public key encryption (PKE), which is used
for securing and authenticating transmissions over unsecure networks. Ex.
1002, 1:6–8, 1:10–2:9. To use PKE for authenticating transmissions, a
transmitted message is encrypted with a sender’s private encryption key (a
1

2

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
key known only to the sender, sometimes referred to as a “secret key”) that
can only be decrypted by the sender’s public encryption key (freely
available), ensuring that the message was sent by the sender. Id. at 1:57–65.
A public key infrastructure (PKI), with a hierarchical system of encrypting
lower nodes’ public keys, allows for a common point of trust between two
parties who wish to communicate with each other. Id. at 3:16–39. The ’574
patent explains that some of the problems with conventional PKE systems
include that such systems do not have a “consistent public key infrastructure
which can actually and automatically provide the certifications required for a
public key system[, a] hierarchical arrangement of certifying authorities
which can cross policy certifying authority boundaries[, or a convenient and
transparent] way for permitting secure transactions to cross organizational
boundaries.” Id. at 4:41–51. The ’574 patent purports to “provid[e] a full,
correct, consistent and very general security infrastructure which will
support global secure electronic transactions across organizational, political
and policy certifying authority boundaries.” Id. at 4:55–59. The challenged
claims recite various processes used within a PKI system to request, issue,
and update public key certificates, add nodes or entities to the hierarchy, and
verify and validate certificates received.

3

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Figure 4 of the ’574 patent is reproduced below:

Figure 4 depicts a logical representation of a portion of a hierarchical PKI
and one way in which that infrastructure may be used to verify transactions.
Ex. 1002, 8:17–29. As can be seen in Figure 4, a hierarchy includes
certification authorities (CAs) CA1–CA4 and users U1 and U2. Id. at Fig. 4.
Not depicted in Figure 4, at a level above CA1, is a policy certifying
authority (PCA), “which defines a particular set of certification policies
[and] set[s] the standards for their particular certification sub-hierarchies.”
Id. at 9:26–30. Each of the CAs follows the policies set by the PCA they fall
under and can then certify subordinate CAs “in a hierarchical fashion until
ultimately the end users are certified at the bottom of the hierarchy.” Id. at
9:37–42.
In order for U2 to be added to the hierarchy and obtain a public key
certificate, which will allow U2 to send communications that can be verified
and validated by a recipient, U2 would send an application for registration to
the PCA. Ex. 1002, 13:65–67. Any other node would follow the same
procedure in order to participate in the PKI and obtain certificates, so that
CAs may certify other nodes, and users may send communications that can
4

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
be verified and validated by a recipient. The PCA may accept or reject the
application for registration. Id. at 14:1–7. If the PCA accepts the
application, the new node is added to a network map certification
infrastructure database, and the node performs steps to obtain a certificate.
Id. at 15:59–67.
A CA or user obtains a certificate by generating new public and
private keys, generating a certificate including the newly generated public
key and any other information required by the policies established by the
PCA, self-signing the certificate, and sending the certificate in a message to
the issuing CA (the CA above it in the hierarchy) to request a signature from
that CA. Ex. 1002, 14:24–34, 15:4–9. The CA uses policies established by
the PCA to authenticate the request. Id. at 14:35–41. If authenticated, the
CA signs the certificate, stores a copy and/or sends a copy to a certificate
repository, and issues the certificate by sending the signed certificate back to
the CA or user in a reply message. Id. at 14:47–52.
When a node’s certificate expires, the node follows a similar process
of generating new keys and requesting issuance of a new certificate from its
issuing CA. If the issuing CA determines that the requesting node is an
already-existing node, the issuing CA also marks the node’s old certificate
as revoked and adds it to a certificate revocation list (CRL). Ex. 1002,
14:43–47.
The requesting node authenticates the reply message received from
the issuing CA by comparing the public key in the signed certificate with the
public key that corresponds to the private key used for signing the message
sent from the node to the issuing CA. Ex. 1002, 14:54–60, 15:10–22. If the
keys match, the node stores the signed certificate. Id. at 14:54–63. If the

5

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
node is a CA with subordinate nodes to which it issued signed certificates,
the CA must update those certificates. Id. at 15:22–25. The CA sends resigned certificates to each of its subordinate nodes (if any), which results in
each subordinate node iteratively receiving a new signed certificate and
determining whether that node has subordinate nodes for which it needs to
reissue certificates. Id. at 15:44–58.
Once a node receives a signed certificate from its issuing CA, other
nodes in the PKI may verify and validate the certificate. Ex. 1002, 1:57–65,
3:22–39, 6:65–7:20, 11:66–12:43. Referring back to Figure 4, U1 may
receive a signed message from user U2. Id. at 12:1–2, Fig. 4. U2 may send a
certificate with the signed message or, in cases where U2 does not send a
certificate, U1 may request the certificate from U2. Id. at 12:7–13. U1 also
may request a certificate from CA2 and CA3. Id. at 12:12–13. Certificates
may be obtained from the owner of the certificate, the CA that issued the
certificate, or from a common repository. Id. at 13:32–35. Each node may
store a certificate for itself and every CA above that node to the highest level
node (e.g., a PCA or a Policy Registration Authority (PRA), which is above
a PCA in the PKI hierarchy), such that in the example depicted in Figure 4,
U2 may store a certificate for itself and a certificate for each of CA1, CA2,
and CA3. Id. at 12:2–6. As seen in Figure 4, node CA1 is the lowest point in
the hierarchy in common between U1 and U2 and is known as the common
point of trust between U1 and U2. Id. at 12:41–43, Fig. 4.
Upon receiving a response to a request for a certificate from a node
(e.g., U2, CA2, and CA3), U1 extracts, verifies, and stores the certificate. Ex.
1002, 12:17–20. U1 may then authenticate the received certificates starting
at the top of the hierarchy. Id. at 12:22–42. U1 already has a known valid

6

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
certificate for CA1 and uses CA1’s public key to authenticate CA2’s
certificate that was issued by CA1. Id. at 12:22–27. The process is iterated
using CA2’s public key to authenticate CA3’s certificate, then using CA3’s
public key to authenticate U2’s certificate. Id. at 12:27–39.
For reliable certification, U1 should also obtain a CRL to ensure that
each certificate has not been revoked. Ex. 1002, 12:65–67. U1 can send a
request to CA1, CA2, and CA3 (or, alternatively, to a common repository) for
the CRL maintained by each CA. Id. at 12:67–13:3, 13:14–24.
D. Illustrative Claims
Of the challenged claims in the ’574 patent, claims 18, 23, 28, 30, and
31 are independent. Claims 18, 23, 28, 30, and 31 each are directed to
methods for implementing various portions of the process of using PKE to
certify secure communications. Therefore, claims 18, 23, 28, 30, and 31 are
illustrative, and recite:
18. In a certification system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of requesting and issuing a public key
certificate, comprising:
a. at a requesting computer process, generating a data structure
containing the data items required for a public key certificate,
including a public key, self-signing the data structure and
sending the signed data structure as a certificate signature
request to a computer process authorized as an issuing
certification authority, and
b. at said computer process authorized as an issuing certification
authority, verifying the authenticity of said request, and if
authentic, certifying and returning the data structure in a
certificate signature reply.

7

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
23. In a global network with secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of verifying a signed data structure sent from
a sender to a receiver, comprising:
a. obtaining a public key certificate for every computer process in
the infrastructure between the sender and a common point of
trust in the infrastructure and
b. verifying the authenticity of signatures iteratively, beginning
with the common point of trust.
28. In a certification system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of validating public key certificates,
comprising:
using the certificate revocation lists of each computer process
between a computer process or user whose certificate is being
validated and a point of trust in common with the computer
process or user which is validating the certificate to ensure the
certificates being used in the validation process do not appear
on any certificate revocation list.
30. In a computer system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of updating certificates, comprising:
a. at a first computer process, which possesses a certificates to be
updated, updating the current certificate by
a.1. receiving a new signed certificate from a computer process
which is authorized to issue the new signed certificate,
a.2. revoking the current certificate previously used for
verification of certificates of subordinate computer
processes,
a.3. issuing new certificates to all subordinate computer
processes for which certificates had been previously signed
by the first computer process and copying to all subordinate
computer processes the new certificate to be used for
verification of new subordinate certificates, and
b. iteratively performing the distribution of the new certificate to
all subsequent subordinate computer processes, until all
8

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
computer processes subordinate in the infrastructure to said first
computer process have the new certificates.
31. In a certification system for secure communications
containing computer processes arranged in a certification
infrastructure, a method of adding a new computer process to the
infrastructure, comprising:
a. adding a new component to a representation of a certification
infrastructure at a location indicative of where the said
computer process is to be added,
b. creating entries in a certificate storage database at least at both
said new computer process and at the computer process
authorized to certify the said new process,
c. obtaining a signed certificate for the said new computer process
from said computer process authorized to certify the new
process and storing it at the said new computer process.
Ex. 1002, 19:4761, 20:816, 20:3242, 20:4667, 21:114.

II. ANALYSIS
A. Claim Construction
In an inter partes review, claim terms are given their broadest
reasonable interpretation in light of the specification in which they appear
and the understanding of others skilled in the relevant art. See 37 C.F.R.
§ 42.100(b); In re Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC, 793 F.3d 1268, 1275–79 (Fed.
Cir. 2015). Applying that standard, we interpret the claim terms of the ’574
patent according to their ordinary and customary meaning in the context of
the written description. See In re Translogic Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249,
1257 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312
(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc)). Patent Owner submits proposed claim
constructions for three terms or phrases—process, common certificate
repository, and verified by a direct inquiry to the certification authority. PO
Resp. 9–13.

10

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
“computer process”
Patent Owner argues that “the broadest reasonable interpretation of
‘process’ . . . include[s] ‘computer program instructions running on a
computer.’”3 PO Resp. 9. Patent Owner alleges that its proposed
construction is consistent with the specification of the ’574 patent because
the description of Figure 1A explains that each block in the flow chart “is
implemented as a computer process running on a computer.” Id.
Petitioner argues that, even to the extent Patent Owner’s proposed
construction is accepted, all of the steps recited in the challenged claims are
still performed at a computer process. Reply 3–4. As one example,
Petitioner points out that the verifying, certifying, and returning steps recited
in claim 18 “clearly take place at a computer running computer instructions
because the emails Kapidzic describes require computers running
instructions.” Id. at 4. Petitioner further asserts that the inventor of the ’574
patent even “admits Kapidzic teaches claim 18’s elements.” Id. (citing Ex.
2017, 42:25–43:14, 48:20–25, 50:18–22, 51:21–53:5). Petitioner argues that
Patent Owner’s argument depends on whether the broadest reasonable
interpretation of the claims excludes all human or manual interaction with
computers or software, which Petitioner asserts is unsupported by the claims
and specification of the ’574 patent. Id. at 4.

3

The heading for the portion of the Response directed to Patent Owner’s
arguments addressing the construction of process is similar to, but
inconsistent with, arguments made in that section. Specifically, Patent
Owner’s heading is: “The proper interpretation of ‘process’ is ‘a computer
program loaded into memory and executing in a processor.’” The reasons
discussed herein for declining to adopt Patent Owner’s proposed
construction apply equally to the construction identified in the heading.
11

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
In particular, Petitioner argues that “certification functions . . . can be
invoked by commands or by messages, such as an http command, an email
message or program to program communication.” Reply 4 (quoting Ex.
1002, 5:65–67). Petitioner further argues the description of Figures 7
through 27 states that the commands and processes described as collectively
forming the certification system, functions and infrastructure of the
invention “may be invoked either directly by a user or by part of an
application process running on the user’s or CA’s computer.” Id. at 4–5
(quoting Ex. 1002, 13:53–61). Petitioner also points to the portion of the
’574 patent that discloses “[t]he appropriate process can be invoked
manually by commands as well.” Id. at 5 (quoting Ex. 1002, 17:66–67).
Petitioner also argues that Patent Owner’s “application of its ‘process’
argument is based on faulty assumptions by its” declarant, Dr. Frederic T.
Chong. Reply 5 (citing PO Resp. 20–23). In particular, Petitioner asserts
Dr. Chong’s statement that “certification in Kapidzic ‘normally require[s]
manual intervention’” (Ex. 2012 ¶ 36) is inaccurate because Kapidzic states
that verifying the identity of a requester, not the entire certification process,
normally requires manual intervention. Reply 5–6 (citing Ex. 1004, 13).
Petitioner further argues that Dr. Chong assumed Kapidzic processed emails
manually, but that he was unaware of whether the emails could have been
automatically processed in December 1995. Id. (citing Ex. 1010, 44:9–21,
46:24–47:3).
We find that “process,” or more specifically, “computer process,” as
recited in each of the challenged claims, should be given its plain and
ordinary meaning. To the extent that there might have been ambiguity as to
the plain and ordinary meaning, the references in the ’574 patent to

12

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
computer processes support the idea that a skilled artisan would have
understood what was meant by the recitation of the term. In particular, the
’574 patent discloses that “[e]ach user or certification authority of the
infrastructure has access to a computer process which comprises appropriate
certification software and storage areas for storing data structures.” Ex.
1002, 5:55–57. The ’574 patent explains that the invention is directed to a
certification system, which:
includes computer processes implementing certification
servers, certification clients and certification protocols, in
which one or more first computer processes are associated with
at least one initial (root) registration authority, one or more
second computer processes are associated with policy
certification authorities, one or more third computer processes
are associated with certification authorities, and one or more
end-user computer processes or application computer processes
are associated with respective end-users or user applications.
Id. at 6:1–13 (emphasis added); see id. at 1:64–66. The ’574 patent further
explains that the processes are arranged in a hierarchy, that each of these
processes may hold certified data structures (i.e., certificates), and that
“users and applications of said system are logically located at end-points of
certification chains in a certification infrastructure.” Id. at 6:14–22.
The computer processes use “a common application programming
interface [API] for access to encryption and certification services,” and the
API “is a set of certification functions which can be invoked by commands
or by messages, such as an http command, an email message or program to
program communication.” Ex. 1002, 5:62–67. Figures 7 through 27 of the
’574 patent “describe a set of processes which collectively form the
certification system, functions, and certification infrastructure of this
invention.” Id. at 13:53–55. “The commands and processes described in
13

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
FIGS 7-2[7] thus present a set of protocol and programming primitives
which may be invoked either directly by a user or by part of an application
process running on the user’s or CA’s computer.” Id. at 13:57–61. The ’574
patent further explains that a certification server process continuously
monitors incoming messages and commands, which may be invoked
manually, and determines which of the certification functions described in
Figures 7 through 27 should be called. Id. at 17:55–67.
Moreover, as discussed above, the ’574 patent refers to entities
(including PCA, CAs, and users) as being associated with computer
processes. See, e.g., Ex. 1002, 1:64–66. Throughout the specification and,
in particular in the description of the specific messages and “processes
which collectively form the certification system” (see id. at 13:53–17:54),
the ’574 patent refers to entities as sending and receiving messages and
executing processes. See Reply 5 (citing Ex. 1002, 11:30–65, 13:64–16:50).
The ’574 patent refers to these processes and entities interchangeably. Ex.
1002, 13:53–17:54.
Thus, an ordinarily skilled artisan would have understood that the
recited computer processes are instances of a computer program or programs
running on the various computers, each of which may be associated with
different nodes or entities (e.g., policy certification authorities, certification
authorities, user applications) that carry out the tasks involved in the
certification system described by the ’574 patent. Functions specifically
recited as being performed at or by a computer process obviously exclude
performance of that function that does not involve a computer process.
Beyond steps explicitly recited as performed at or by a computer process,

14

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
however, we find nothing in the recitations of a computer process that would
exclude manual invocation or other manual intervention.
“common certificate repository”
Patent Owner argues that the broadest reasonable interpretation of
“common certificate repository” is “a repository that stores public key
certificates for all certification authorities [in the certification
infrastructure].” PO Resp. 10 (citing Ex. 2012 ¶¶ 17–19). Patent Owner
asserts that the ’574 patent, which states that a “common certificate
repository may contain public key certificates for all certification authorities
in the hierarchy,” requires a construction that a common certificate
repository keeps a certificate for each and every certification authority in the
infrastructure. Id.
Petitioner argues that the ’574 patent discloses that the common
certificate repository may include public key certificates for all CAs in the
hierarchy, and that, because “may” is permissive, the proper construction is
not limited as proposed by Patent Owner. Reply 7. Petitioner also asserts
that the inventor of the ’574 patent admitted that the X.500 directory,
disclosed in Kapidzic and relied upon in Petitioner’s challenges, is one
example of a common certificate repository. Id. (citing Ex. 2017, 54:20–
55:13).
Because we use the broadest reasonable interpretation for construing
claims, we decline to limit the construction of common certificate repository
to require storage of public key certificates for all CAs, or even all CAs
within a hierarchy or infrastructure. Other than declining to adopt Patent
Owner’s proposed narrowing of the plain and ordinary meaning of a

15

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
common certificate repository, we do not find it necessary to provide an
explicit construction of the term.
Whether recitation of a method step
introduced by “may” further limits a claim
Before we address the parties’ arguments regarding the construction
of “verified by a direct inquiry to the certification authority,” recited in claim
25, we must first address the use of “may” to introduce limitations in claims
25–27. “[O]ptional elements do not narrow the claim because they can
always be omitted.” In re Johnston, 435 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2006).
Claims that use the term “may” to introduce a limitation are permissive and,
thus, do not narrow the scope of the claim. Id. Thus, the use of the term
“may” or “may also” in claims 25–27 is not limiting. Specifically, claims
25–27, which recite “[t]he method of verifying of claim 23 in which a public
key certificate . . . may” be obtained or verified by various steps, do not
further limit claim 23, from which they depend.
We are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that claim 25,
which recites that the method of claim 23 “may also be verified by a direct
inquiry,” “provides an alternative” approach to the iterative approach recited
in claim 23. PO Resp. 12; see Johnston, 435 F.3d at 1385. Therefore, for
purposes of this inter partes review, we construe claims 25–27 to be of the
same scope as, and stand or fall with, independent claim 23.
With respect to claim 22, which recites in part that “the new
certificate may contain either the existing or a new public key,” the parties
appear to agree that the recited language requires the certificate to have
either the existing public key or a new public key. However, we find that
the permissive language in claim 22 also fails to further limit the claim. The

16

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
claim could have recited that the certificate contains (as opposed to may
contain) either the existing or a new public key. Therefore, we find the
scope of claim 22 to be the same as if the claim recited: “The method of
claim 18, performed upon expiration of an existing certificate.”
“verified by a direct inquiry to the certification authority”
The parties dispute the proper construction of this phrase. However,
we need not reach this issue because the disputed phrase is recited only in
claim 25 as part of a non-limiting clause. As discussed above, we construe
claims 25–27 to be of the same scope as claim 23.
B. The Asserted Grounds
1. Anticipation of Claims 18–31 by Kapidzic
Petitioner asserts claims 18–31 are unpatentable as anticipated by
Kapidzic, and provides a chart showing where Kapidzic allegedly discloses
each limitation. Pet. 15–34. As explained below, we conclude that
Petitioner has met its burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, as
required by 35 U.S.C. § 316(e), that claims 18–21 and 23–31 are
unpatentable as anticipated by Kapidzic. Petitioner, however, has not met its
burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 22 is
unpatentable as anticipated by Kapidzic.
a. Kapidzic (Ex. 1004)
Kapidzic is one paper in a collection of papers, which were the subject
of a symposium on network and distributed system security. Ex. 1004, 1–4,
10. Kapidzic discloses a “Certificate Management System (CMS),” which
“is a networked system for generation, distribution, storage and verification
of certificates for use in a variety of security enhanced applications.” Id. at
10.

Figure 1 of Kapidzic is reproduced below:

Figure 1 depicts a logical representation of a hierarchy within a public key
infrastructure of the CMS disclosed by Kapidzic. Ex. 1004, 11.
b. Whether Kapidzic Is Prior Art
Patent Owner argues that Kapidzic is not prior art under § 102(a)
because “to the extent that Kapidzic discloses any of the concepts of claims
18-31 of the ’574 patent, these concepts were derived from Dr. Sead Muftic,
the sole inventor of those concepts.” PO Resp. 16 (citing Ex. 2010 ¶ 13).
Specifically, Patent Owner asserts that “Dr. Muftic conceived of the
concepts claimed in the ’574 patent,” and “[t]he concepts described in
Kapidzic also originated from Dr. Muftic.” Id. at 18.
Dr. Muftic testifies that: (1) he conceived of all the concepts described
in Kapidzic; (2) Dr. Nada Kapidzic was his Ph.D. student from about 1992
to 1997; (3) Mr. Alan Davidson was his Licentiate student from about 1992
to 1995; (4) he explained the details of the concepts in Kapidzic to
Dr. Kapidzic, who wrote about them under Dr. Muftic’s direction and

18

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
supervision; (5) Mr. Davidson wrote a computer program prototype
implementing the concepts of the system described in Kapidzic, and
Mr. Davidson assisted Dr. Kapidzic in writing Kapidzic; (6) he omitted his
name from Kapidzic to allow Dr. Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson to receive
publication credit to help build their academic careers; (7) he has had a
similar practice in other situations to aid students in building their academic
careers and attend conferences; (8) he had already co-authored two papers
(Exs. 2007, 2009, collectively “the two co-authored articles”) in the same
area and multiple articles in the field of computer security and “did not deem
it important to list himself as an author on the Kapidzic article”; and (9) the
contributions in Kapidzic are his contributions, not Dr. Kapidzic’s or
Mr. Davidson’s. PO Resp. 18–20; Ex. 2010 ¶¶ 13–16, 19–22, 25–33. Patent
Owner submits that Dr. Muftic’s testimony is supported by circumstantial
evidence, namely: (1) the co-authors of Kapidzic (i.e., Nada Kapidzic and
Alan Davidson) were Dr. Muftic’s graduate students; (2) Dr. Muftic is listed
as co-author, with Dr. Kapidzic, on a paper published around the same time
as Kapidzic and relating to the same area (Ex. 2007); and (3) Dr. Muftic is
listed as co-author, with Dr. Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson, on another paper
published around the same time and relating to the same area (Ex. 2009).
PO Resp. 18–19; IPR2014-00660, Paper 57 (“’660 Tr.”), 29:8–23, 30:18–
31:2, 39:17–40:2.
Patent Owner argues an inventor need not be listed as an author on a
reference in order to disqualify that reference as prior art. PO Resp. 17
(citing Pictometry Int’l Corp. v. Geospan Corp., No. 2011-010700, 2011
WL 4857918 (BPAI Oct. 7, 2011)). Patent Owner also asserts that a
declaration from an inventor is sufficient to remove a reference as prior art

19

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
and that declarations from co-authors supporting an inventor’s testimony are
not required. Id. at 16–17 (citing In re Katz, 687 F.2d 450, 454–55 (CCPA
1982)). At oral hearing for IPR2014-00660, which involves the same patent
and a similar challenge based on Kapidzic, Patent Owner acknowledged that
corroboration is necessary. See Int’l Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Intellectual
Ventures II LLC, IPR2014–00660, Paper 57, 28:11–29:12, 34:20–24, 37:16–
38:5 (August 24, 2015). Specifically, Patent Owner acknowledged that
testimony of the inventor of the ’574 patent is not, by itself, enough to show
conception, and that Patent Owner must provide sufficient corroborative
evidence that all of the ideas in Kapidzic are attributable to Dr. Muftic. Id.
Patent Owner also acknowledged that, in order to be disqualified as a prior
art reference under § 102(a), Kapidzic needs to be only Dr. Muftic’s work.
Id. at 41:5–19.
Petitioner argues that Patent Owner has only uncorroborated
testimony from Dr. Muftic that the ideas in Kapidzic all originated from
Dr. Muftic. Reply 1–3. Petitioner asserts that Patent Owner must establish
that Kapidzic was solely Dr. Muftic’s work. Reply 1 (citing Allergan v.
Apotex Inc., 754 F.3d 952 (Fed. Cir. 2014)). Petitioner argues Patent
Owner’s analogy to Pictometry is inapplicable because, in Pictometry, it was
clear that the author of the article was writing about another’s work. Id. at
1–2. Petitioner distinguishes Katz, cited by Patent Owner, by pointing out
that the inventor was a co-author on the publication he sought to remove as
prior art. Id. at 2. Petitioner argues that Dr. Muftic’s testimony, by itself, is
not enough to make the necessary showing that Kapidziz, which is not coauthored by Dr. Muftic, does not qualify as prior art. Id. Petitioner further
argues that the Kapidzic article itself, and Dr. Kapidzic’s thesis (Ex. 2011)

20

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
contradict Dr. Muftic’s testimony that Kapidzic is Dr. Muftic’s work. Id.
(citing Ex. 2011, 3–4). Finally, Petitioner argues Dr. Muftic is unable to
separate his contributions from those of Dr. Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson or
from the prior art, leaving no evidence in the record showing “what in
Kapidzic allegedly constitutes [Dr.] Muftic’s sole work versus the work of
the named authors or authors of the prior-art RFCs.” Id. at 3 (citing Ex.
2017, 90:21–91:23, 95:16–97:22, 98:20–100:9).
The requirement for corroboration of inventor testimony “arose out of
a concern that inventors testifying in patent infringement cases would be
tempted to remember facts favorable to their case by the lure of protecting
their patent or defeating another’s patent.” Mahurkar v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 79
F.3d 1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Looking to Dr. Kapidzic’s doctoral
thesis, the “Publications Overview” section of Dr. Kapidzic’s thesis
indicates that she “was the main designer of the overall CMS system, as well
as of the CMS Client [and t]he functionality of CMS servers (CAs) was
designed by the author in co-operation with Alan Davidson.” Ex. 2011, 3–4.
That section further indicates that Kapidzic, referred to in the thesis as
“KAP2,” was “published as the result of the author’s work,” “presents the
overall design of CMS (done by the author), as well as its functions and
protocols (done by the author in co-operation with Alan Davidson),” and
“represents the bases for Chapter 3 of this thesis.” Id. at 4 (emphases
added).
Although we agree that authorship of articles is not necessarily
determinative of whose ideas are present in a paper, we do not find Patent
Owner has sufficiently corroborated Dr. Muftic’s testimony to establish that
the entirety of Kapidzic can be attributed solely to Dr. Muftic. Our

21

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
reviewing court has stated that “sufficient circumstantial evidence of an
independent nature can satisfy the corroboration requirement.” Cooper v.
Goldfarb, 154 F.3d 1321, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (emphasis added). We find
Patent Owner has not submitted sufficient independent circumstantial
evidence corroborating Dr. Muftic’s testimony that the entirety of the ideas
in Kapidzic originated with Dr. Muftic.
Other than Dr. Muftic’s own testimony, there is no evidence on record
regarding which aspects of either of the two co-authored articles were his.
See Reply 3. Even looking to Dr. Muftic’s testimony, Patent Owner has not
established sufficiently which aspects of Kapidzic it alleges originated with
Dr. Muftic. See Ex. 2010 ¶¶ 13, 17, 24–26, 33. In fact, Dr. Kapidzic’s
doctoral thesis, as discussed above, directly contradicts Dr. Muftic’s
testimony, and states that the ideas in Kapidzic were those of only
Dr. Kapidzic and Mr. Davidson. Ex. 2011, 3. Dr. Kapidzic’s thesis was
submitted approximately two years after Kapidzic was published, whereas
Dr. Muftic’s testimony is nearly two decades later. Id. at page B. Moreover,
Dr. Muftic was Dr. Kapidzic’s advisor and, presumably, had an opportunity
to review the thesis. Weighing the submitted evidence, we find Patent
Owner has not established that Kapidzic is entirely the work of Dr. Muftic.
Therefore, Patent Owner has not established that Kapidzic should be
disqualified as prior art.
c. Claims 18, 19, and 21
Kapidzic discloses a requester in a CMS sending a certificate request
message to a certificate authority (CA) and the CA sending back a message
with a signed certificate, which Petitioner maps to “a method of requesting
and issuing a public key certificate,” as recited in the preamble of

22

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
independent claim 18. Pet. 17–18, 21 (citing Ex. 1004, 10–13). Kapidzic
further discloses a CA generating a pair of keys (public and private), and
sending a self-signed certificate created from the public key to a parent CA.
Ex. 1004, 10, 12–13. Petitioner maps that disclosure of Kapidzic to the first
method step reciting that one process generates a certificate with a public
key, self-signs the certificate, and sends the self-signed certificate in a
request to an issuing CA. Pet. 17–18, 21–22. Kapidzic also discloses the
parent CA verifying the request, signing the certificate, and sending a reply
back to the requester, which Petitioner maps to the recited step of the issuing
CA process “verifying the authenticity of said request, and . . . certifying and
returning the” certificate to the requesting process in a reply. Id. at 18, 22
(citing Ex. 1004, 10, 12–13).
The description of Kapidzic’s certification process that is cited as
disclosing the method recited in independent claim 18 is supported by Figure
2 of Kapidzic. Figure 2 of Kapidzic is reproduced below:

23

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Figure 2 depicts an example of a certification process of a CA by its parent
CA (in this case a PCA) in the CMS disclosed by Kapidzic. Ex. 1004, 12.
Patent Owner argues that “Kapidzic does not state anywhere that the
certification authorities (CAs) or other components of the CMS are
processes that perform these features.” PO Resp. 20. Patent Owner asserts
that Kapidzic’s certification process, which Patent Owner submits requires
manual intervention, does not meet the method recited in claim 18, which
includes “at said computer process . . . verifying the authenticity of said
[certificate signature] request, and if authentic, certifying and returning the
data structure in a certificate signature reply.” Id. at 20–21. Patent Owner
specifically points to the portions of Kapidzic that disclose the certificate
signature request and reply messages being sent as “e-mail letters” and that
verifying the identity of a requester “will normally require manual
intervention,” arguing that sending email messages cannot be used to
automate certification because it requires manual inspection. Id. at 21–22
(quoting Ex. 1004, 12–13).
As previously addressed, Petitioner argues Patent Owner’s proposed
construction of processes, or more specifically the recited computer
processes, are improperly narrow, excluding manual intervention
notwithstanding disclosures in the ’574 patent that contemplate manual
intervention. See Reply 3–6. Petitioner further asserts the ’574 patent
describes the CAs and users as being associated with and having access to
computers with software and storage for carrying out the PKI functions. Id.
at 5 (citing Ex. 1002, 5:55–61, 9:8–10:10).
As discussed above, we do not find persuasive Patent Owner’s claim
construction argument that all manual intervention is excluded by the claim.

24

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Nevertheless, we evaluate Petitioner’s arguments as applied to the properly
construed claims to ascertain whether Kapidzic discloses performing the
recited step as claimed. The steps that claim 18 recites as being performed
“at a computer process” are “generating a data structure,” “sending the
signed data structure,” “verifying the authenticity of said [certificate
signature] request,” and “certifying and returning the data structure.” In the
context of Kapidzic, it is clear that generating a data structure, which
includes generating RSA keys and which is subsequently sent via email,
sending the signed data structure, which is done via email, and returning the
data structure, which is also done via email, are all steps that involve
computer processes. See Ex. 1004, 12–13. Thus, our focus is on whether
Kapidzic discloses verifying the authenticity and certifying the data structure
“at a computer process.”
With respect to the certifying step, Kapidzic explains that “[i]f all the
checks verify successfully, the parent CA signs the certificate and . . . creates
a Certificate Signature Reply that contains the signed certificate.” Ex. 1004,
13. This description indicates that the certification done by the parent CA
includes “signing” the electronic data structure and, thus, involves a
computer process. The verifying the authenticity step also requires a
computer process. For example, even if verifying an identity is required and
such verification is done manually, the issuing CA at least needs to be able
to read the data structure it received by email as part of the process of
verifying an identity. Thus, we find that Kapidzic discloses “at said
computer process . . . verifying the authenticity of said request.” Moreover,
Kapidzic discloses in Section 8 that the integration of signing and
storage/retrieval protocols “opens the opportunity for the CMS to fully

25

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
automate the process of certificate retrieval and verification, independently
of any other system,” and that “CMS UAs provide APIs [7], which enable
different security enhanced applications to be easily interfaced with the
CMS, supplying them with verified certificates.” Ex. 1004, 16 (emphasis
added). That disclosure appears to indicate that Kapidzic contemplates an
entirely automated certificate management system, such that every process
disclosed by Kapidzic, not just the processes relied upon by Petitioner for
disclosing the subject matter recited in the challenged claims, could be done
at a computer process.
Claim 19 depends from claim 18 and further recites “storing the
received signed certificate at said requesting computer process.” Claim 21
depends from claim 18 and recites performing the method of claim 18
“when adding a new entity to a certification infrastructure, which entity may
be [a] policy certification authority, certification authority, application[,] or
end-user.” Petitioner points to Kapidzic’s disclosure of storing the received
certificate (Pet. 23 (quoting Ex. 1004, 13)) and performing the method of
claim 18 when registering a new CA (Pet. 24 (quoting Ex. 1004, 12)).
Patent Owner only argues that claims 19 and 21, which depend from claim
18, are patentable for the same reasons as argued with respect to claim 18.
PO Resp. 23, 24. For the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 18, 19, and
21 are anticipated by Kapidzic.
d. Claim 20
Claim 20 depends from claim 18 and further recites “storing the
received signed certificate or copy of a signed certificate at a common
certificate repository.” Petitioner maps the additional limitation recited in

26

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
claim 20 to Kapidzic’s disclosure of CAs keeping “local copies of all the
certificates in its certificate verification path, as well as the certificates of all
its immediate subordinates,” and each CA being “ready to respond to
retrieval requests” for those certificates it is storing (i.e., that CA’s
subordinates’ certificates). Pet. 23 (quoting Ex. 1004, 11, 13). Petitioner
also points to the X.500 directories referenced in Kapidzic as meeting the
common certificate repository, but that argument was raised for the first time
in Petitioner’s Reply and, therefore, we decline to consider it. Reply 7.
Patent Owner argues that keeping local copies of certificates is the
opposite of having a common repository storing certificates for all CAs. PO
Resp. 24. As discussed above, we find that a common certificate repository
does not need to store a certificate for every certificate in the PKI.
Therefore, under the plain and ordinary meaning of a common certificate
repository, we find Kapidzic’s disclosure of each CA maintaining a
certificate for all of the certificates it has issued to its direct subordinates
meets the recited common certificate repository because each CA is a
common storage location for the certificate of each subordinate processes
(CAs and/or users). Therefore, we find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that claim 20 is anticipated by Kapidzic.
e. Claim 22
Claim 22 depends from claim 18 and further recites performing the
method of claim 18 “upon expiration of an existing certificate, where the
new certificate may contain either the existing or a new public key.” Ex.
1002, 20:57. Patent Owner argues that Kapidzic discloses performing the
process that Petitioner maps to the subject matter of claim 18 “when a
current pair of keys expires,” not when the certificate expires. PO Resp. 24–

27

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
25. Patent Owner argues expiration of keys is not the same as the expiration
of a certificate. Id. at 25. Petitioner argues Kapidzic discloses this
limitation because the same certification procedure discussed above is
followed when a CA’s key pair expires requiring the CA to change its keys.
Pet. 24. Petitioner further argues “Dr. Chong offered no explanation for why
key expiration is not the same as certificate expiration,” and asserts PKI
Study describes a certificate expiring when its keys expire. Reply 7–8
(citing Ex. 1005, 71–72, 134–36).
Notwithstanding Petitioner’s assertion that Patent Owner has not
explained why key expiration is not the same as certificate expiration, the
burden is on Petitioner to demonstrate the claim elements are disclosed by
Kapidzic. Petitioner merely cites to PKI Report, which it alleges
demonstrates that a skilled artisan would understand that key expiration
results in certificate expiration. Petitioner, however, does not provide
sufficient testimony to support its attorney argument. See Pet. 14; Reply 8.
Thus, Petitioner has not met its burden in demonstrating anticipation of
claim 22 by Kapidzic. Accordingly, we find Petitioner has not
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 22 is
anticipated by Kapidzic.
f. Claims 23–27
Kapidzic discloses a CA sending a “Certificate Reply” message
“contain[ing] the requested certificate as well as all the certificates in the
certificate verification path, up to the top of the hierarchy,” which Petitioner
maps to “obtaining a public key certificate for every computer process in the
infrastructure between the sender and a common point of trust in the
infrastructure,” as recited in independent claim 23. Pet. 25–26 (citing Ex.

28

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
1004, 13–14). Kapidzic also discloses “verif[ying] the signatures of the
certificates from the message, starting from the PCA’s certificate” down to
the lowest level certificate in the message, which Petitioner maps to
“verifying the authenticity of signatures iteratively, beginning with the
common point of trust,” as recited in claim 23. Id. at 26 (citing Ex. 1004,
13). The portions of Kapidzic cited by Petitioner explain that the
verification process, when requesting a certificate, is the same process used
when initially receiving a signed certificate. Ex. 1004, 13.
Patent Owner argues that Kapidzic does not explain how the
certificate “of a second user” that is being verified was received and, thus,
Kapidzic does not disclose verifying the certificate of a sender. PO Resp.
26–27. Patent Owner further argues that, because Kapidzic does not
disclose “processes,” claim 23 is not anticipated by Kapidzic. Id. at 27–28.
Petitioner points out that Patent Owner argues in its Response “that
Kapidzic teaches requesting and issuing certificates via email
communications, so every signed data structure in Kapidzic is therefore from
‘a sender’ (i.e., each certificate request and issued certificate was sent by
some entity via email) and thus clearly meets claim 23’s requirement.”
Reply 8. Petitioner further asserts that Kapidzic clearly describes a scenario
where a UCA is a “sender.” Id. (citing Ex. 1004, 13).
We have already discussed above that Kapidzic discloses computer
processes generally. Moreover, as discussed above, the ’574 patent explains
that each of the entities in a hierarchy is associated with a process. Given
the context of how the ’574 patent informs a proper construction of
performing the recited steps at or by a computer process, we find
unpersuasive Patent Owner’s arguments that Kapidzic lacks processes or

29

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
that Kapidzic does not obtain public key certificates for each process. In
view of the disclosure of the ’574 patent, we find Kapidzic’s chain of
certificates returned to a requester meets the recited certificates for each
computer process.
Claims 24–27 depend from claim 23. Claim 24 further recites that “a
public key certificate for every computer process in the infrastructure
between the sender and a common point of trust is also verified against all
relevant certificate revocation lists.” Petitioner points to Kapidzic’s
disclosure of checking each certificate being verified against CRLs. Pet. 27
(quoting Ex. 1004, 15–16). Patent Owner only argues that claim 24 is
patentable for the same reasons as argued with respect to claim 23. PO
Resp. 28. As discussed above, we find the scope of claims 25–27 to be the
same as claim 23. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner
has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 23–27 are
anticipated by Kapidzic.
g. Claims 28 and 29
Kapidzic discloses “[t]he certificate verification process must
therefore include a check that the otherwise seemingly valid certificate has
not been revoked.” Ex. 1004, 15. Kapidzic also discloses “check[ing] the
certificate against the current CRL of the same issuer” for every certificate
being verified. Id. Petitioner maps those disclosures of Kapidzic to the
method of validating a public key including using CRLs “of each computer
process between a computer process or user whose certificate is being
validated and a point of trust in common with the computer process or user
which is validating the certificate,” as recited in independent claim 28. Pet.
29. Kapidzic also discloses storing CRLs for later use in verification after

30

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
retrieval of CRLs and obtaining CRLs if they are not available locally,
which Petitioner maps to “[t]he method of claim 28 in which retrieved
certificate revocation lists are stored locally in the computer at which the
certificate is being validated,” as recited in dependent claim 29. Id. (citing
Ex. 1004, 15–16).
Patent Owner again argues that Kapidzic does not disclose computer
processes. PO Resp. 33–34. Patent Owner also asserts that Kapidzic merely
discloses checking each certificate against a current CRL of the same issuer.
Id. at 32–33. Patent Owner appears to argue that each certificate must be
checked against multiple CRLs. Id. Patent Owner only argues that claim
29, which depends from claim 28, is patentable for the same reasons as
argued with respect to claim 28. Id. at 34.
Petitioner interprets Patent Owner’s argument as asserting “that
Kapidzic is not explicit about using every CRL in the chain between a point
of trust and the user whose certificate is being validated.” Reply 10.
Petitioner argues that Patent Owner’s declarant, Dr. Chong, could not
explain the argument regarding checking every CRL and could not identify
which CRLs are not checked in a simple three-node chain of trust example.
Id. (citing Ex. 1010, 75:23–76:14). To the extent Patent Owner argues that
there are CRLs in a chain of trust that are not checked against at least one
certificate, we disagree. Petitioner pointed to portions of Kapidzic that
disclose checking each certificate associated with each CA in the chain of
trust against a CRL maintained by that respective CA. See Pet. 29 (quoting
Ex. 1004, 15).
To the extent Patent Owner argues each certificate needs to be
checked against multiple CRLs, we disagree with such an implicit

31

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
construction. The appropriate construction of claim 28, in light of the
specification, includes using the CRL created at each CA to ensure that each
certificate issued by that respective CA does not appear on that CRL, i.e., the
CRL retrieved from the respective issuing CA. We have already addressed
Patent Owner’s assertion that Kapidzic does not disclose processes generally
and find that each CRL is associated with a particular CA and its processes.
Therefore, we find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that claims 28 and 29 are anticipated by Kapidzic.
h. Claim 30
Kapidzic discloses that a new key pair may need to be generated when
the key expires or is believed to be compromised and that “[w]hen a new
key pair is generated by some CA, the same procedure is followed as in the
original certification.” Ex. 1004, 13–14. Kapidzic also discloses that “when
a certificate is updated, the old certificate must be revoked” and the CA
needs to re-sign all certificates it has issued with its new key and inform its
subordinates of the change so that the entire sub-hierarchy can be updated
iteratively. Id. at 12, 14. Petitioner maps those disclosures of Kapidzic to
the method of updating certificates recited in independent claim 30. Pet. 30–
32 (citing Ex. 1004, 10–15).
Patent Owner argues that Kapidzic does not disclose several of the
steps of claim 30. PO Resp. 34–40. For clarity in analyzing Patent Owner’s
arguments, we provide an explanation of how the method of claim 30 is
performed using a simple exemplary infrastructure wherein process A has
subordinate processes M and N, and process M has subordinate processes X
and Y. In this example, M is the recited “first computer process,” A is the
recited “computer process which is authorized to issue the new signed

32

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
certificate,” and X and Y are the recited “subordinate computer processes [of
process M].” In this example, therefore, M “possesses a certificate[] to be
updated.” According to the process recited in claim 30, M’s certificate is
updated by “receiving a new signed certificate [MC2] from” A, and
revoking M’s “current certificate [MC1] previously used for verification of
certificates of” X and Y. The receiving step is not disputed by Patent Owner
as being disclosed by Kapidzic.
Patent Owner argues that, even though Kapidzic discloses revoking a
certificate when its keys change, Kapidzic does not disclose the next step—
revoking certificates that were previously used for verification—because no
reference to revoking certificates in Kapidzic explicitly states that the
certificate to be revoked was used to verify certificates of subordinate
computers. PO Resp. 35–36. Patent Owner’s argument is unpersuasive.
Kapidzic discloses revoking a certificate that was used to verify subordinate
processes’ certificates. In fact, in Patent Owner’s subsequent argument, it
cites one of the passages in Kapidzic explaining that changing keys of a CA
“affects the certification hierarchy, since all certificates of direct
subordinates have been signed with the old secret key.” PO Resp. 37
(quoting Ex. 1004, 14 (emphasis added)). In our example, that passage of
Kapidzic discloses that, prior to revocation of M’s current certificate (MC1),
certificates of M’s direct subordinates, X and Y, “have been signed with”
MC1. Thus, when revoking MC1, Kapidzic discloses revoking a certificate
that was previously used for verification.
The next recited step is “issuing new certificates [XC2 and YC2] to all
subordinate computer processes [X and Y, respectively] for which
certificates had been previously signed by the first computer process [M].”

33

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Patent Owner does not appear to dispute that Kapidzic discloses this step of
claim 30. Regardless, Petitioner points to Kapidzic’s disclosure of the
process that occurs in response to updating keys in a certificate. Pet. 31
(quoting Ex. 1004, 12–15). In particular, Petitioner points to the explanation
in Kapidzic of sending “Certificate Re-Sign” messages using the same
format as the “Certificate Signature Reply” messages. Id. We agree that
Kapidzic discloses the recited step of issuing new certificates to subordinate
processes.
The next recited steps, which Patent Owner argues are not disclosed
by Kapidzic, are “copying to all subordinate computer processes the new
certificate to be used for verification of new subordinate certificates” and
iteratively distributing new certificates. PO Resp. 36–38. Patent Owner
argues claim 30 recites copying a newly issued certificate (which is used to
verify subordinate computers’ certificates) to the subordinate computers,
whereas Kapidzic discloses using the newly-issued certificate to certify new
certificates for each of its subordinate computers that are copied to each
respective subordinate computer and will, in turn, be used by those
subordinates to certify each of their subordinate computers’ certificates. Id.
at 37. Patent Owner argues the recited “iteratively performing the
distribution” step also relates to distributing the newly signed certificate,
which we refer to in this example as MC2. Id. at 38. We agree with Patent
Owner regarding the disclosure of Kapidzic. We disagree, however, with
Patent Owner’s implicit claim construction, which we find inconsistent with
what the ’574 patent discloses.
In our example, Patent Owner argues that claim 30 requires copying
MC2 (M’s newly issued certificate) to each of its subordinate processes, X

34

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
and Y (and iteratively to further subordinate processes of X and Y). A
review of the claim, in light of the specification, leads us to a different
construction. Continuing with our example, we construe the claim to require
copying XC2 to X and copying YC2 to Y. Initially, looking at the language
of the claim, we note that step “a.1” recites “receiving a new signed
certificate [MC2],” and step “a.3” recites “issuing new certificates [XC2 and
YC2] to all subordinate computer processes.” Ex. 1002, 20:51–58
(emphasis added). The disputed copying step recites “copying to all
subordinate computer processes the new certificate to be used for
verification.” Id. at 20:59–61 (emphasis added). Thus, the claim language
refers back to the “new certificates” (i.e., XC2 and YC2) rather than
referring to the “new signed certificate” (i.e., MC2), supporting a
construction that “the new certificate” being copied to a subordinate
computer process is a respective new certificate that is “to be used” by that
process to verify its subordinate processes’ certificates.
Moreover, a review of the processes described in the ’574 patent
supports this construction. Ex. 1002, Figs. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 14:24–53,
15:4–32, 15:44–58. Specifically, the “Update__CA” process described in
the ’574 patent, which invokes additional processes and sends various
messages, describes copying a newly issued certificate to each subordinate
computer process (through a “Certificate__Resign__Reply” message) so that
each respective subordinate computer process may use that certificate to
certify its subordinate computer processes. Id. The process may then repeat
if the subordinate computer process has its own subordinate computer
processes. Id. at 15:48–51. The process disclosed does not describe copying
a newly issued parent certificate (MC2 in our example) to one of its

35

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
subordinate computer processes (X and Y in our example). Therefore, we
are persuaded that Kapidzic discloses the recited copying and iterative
distribution steps.
Patent Owner also repeats its argument that Kapidzic does not teach
processes. Patent Owner’s argument regarding Kapidzic’s processes already
has been addressed above. Therefore, we find Petitioner has demonstrated,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 30 is anticipated by Kapidzic.
i. Claim 31
Kapidzic discloses that “[t]he certification hierarchy is established
top-down, starting with the PCA,” which is responsible for the
administration of the hierarchy structure. Ex. 1004, 11–12. Kapidzic further
discloses that establishment of a CA includes two phases, specifically
registration and certification (the request for and signing of a certificate
discussed above) and that “[n]o CA can be added to the hierarchy without
first registering its DN with the PCA.” Id. In order to register itself, a CA
may provide a suggested “relative distinguished name” and the name of its
parent CA, which specifies its place in the CMS hierarchy. Id. at 12. Upon
receipt of that information, the PCA may generate a unique distinguished
name (DN) for the CA and “[t]he PCA updates its local database with the
CA’s DN, address and its position in the hierarchy.” Id. Petitioner maps the
disclosures of Kapidzic related to registration of a CA to “adding a new
component to a representation of a certification infrastructure at a location
indicative of where the said computer process is to be added,” as recited in
independent claim 31. Pet. 33 (citing Ex. 1004, 10–12).
As part of the certification process in the CMS, Kapidzic discloses
that the parent CA verifies a request from a CA desiring certification, signs

36

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
the certificate, stores a local copy, and sends a reply with the signed
certificate back to the requesting CA. Ex. 1004, 13. Kapidzic also discloses
that the requesting CA verifies the signatures of the certificates from the
reply message (including its own requested certificate) and stores the
certificates in a local database. Id. Petitioner maps those disclosures to
“creating entries in a certificate storage database at least at both said new
computer process and at the computer process authorized to certify the said
new process,” and “obtaining a signed certificate for the said new computer
process from said computer process authorized to certify the new process
and storing it at the said new computer process,” as recited in independent
claim 31. Pet. 33–34 (citing Ex. 1004, 12–14).
Patent Owner argues only that Kapidzic does not disclose that CAs or
other CMS components are processes. For the reasons discussed in the
claim construction section, we find Kapidzic discloses computer processes.
Moreover, we find that those processes are associated with the various CMS
entities or components and that the portions of Kapidzic pointed to by
Petitioner disclose the recited steps of claim 31. Therefore, we find
Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim
31 is anticipated by Kapidzic.
2. Anticipation of Claims 23–31 by PKI Report, Obviousness of
Claims 25, 29, and 30 over PKI Report, and Obviousness of
Claims 18–22 over PKI Report and RFC 1424
Petitioner asserts claims 23–31 are unpatentable as anticipated by PKI
Report, claims 25, 29, and 30 would have been obvious in view of PKI
Report, and claims 18–22 would have been obvious in view of PKI Report
and RFC 1424. Pet. 34–59. Petitioner provides a chart showing where PKI
Report allegedly discloses or teaches each limitation of claims 23–31 and

37

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
where the PKI Report or RFC 1424 teaches each limitation of claims 18–22.
Id. at 40–59. As described below, we conclude that Petitioner has met its
burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, as required by
35 U.S.C. § 316(e), that claims 18–30 are unpatentable as anticipated by, or
obvious in view of, PKI Report or the combination of PKI Report and RFC
1424. We further conclude, however, that Petitioner has not met its burden
to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 31 is unpatentable
as anticipated by PKI Report.
a. PKI Report (Ex. 1005)
PKI Report is the result of a study requested by the NIST (National
Institute of Standards and Technology) and conducted by the MITRE
Corporation to study “alternatives for automated management of public keys
and of the associated public key certificates for the Federal Government.”
Ex. 1005, 5, 7 (emphasis added). PKI Report addresses issues of a public
key infrastructure (PKI) for automatically managing public keys using
public key certificates. Id. at 7. PKI Report includes user and technical
“requirements that relate to the generation and distribution of keys, to the
obtaining of public key certificates and to the distribution of” CRLs. Id.
The entities within the PKI may be arranged in a hierarchical structure. Id.
at 8.
The PKI described in PKI Report may be used for encrypting
messages to ensure confidentiality, but the focus of PKI Report is verifying
the sender of a message. Ex. 1005, 22. In order to verify the signature on a
message, a recipient must be confident in the integrity of the public key used
to decrypt the signed message. Id. at 22, 26. The verifier may have
confidence in the integrity of the key used to decrypt a message “because it

38

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
was manually delivered [or the verifier] obtained it from a certificate signed
by an entity for which he holds a public key he trusts.” Id. at 26. Thus, the
verifier must hold a chain of trusted keys back to a common point of trust,
for which the verifier obtained a key “in a trusted ‘out-of-band’ manner.”
Id. This chain of trust is called a certification path (id. at 27) and allows for
a hierarchical system of validating a certificate by starting with the common
point of trust and iteratively obtaining the key at the next level until the
sender’s certificate may be verified using the issuing CA’s key. Id. at 26,
27. In particular, a “certification path is a sequence of CAs, the first being a
CA for which the verifier holds a trusted copy of the public key and the last
being the CA that issued the certificate certifying the needed PKI entity’s
public key.” Id. at 27.
Recognizing that keys in global systems may originate from anywhere
in the world, PKI Report studied alternatives for establishing an automated
system to manage and distribute keys electronically, namely a PKI. Ex.
1005, 23. The purposes of the desired PKI include generating public key
certificates binding the identity of users to their public keys, providing users
with easy access to other users’ certificates, and providing users with timely
information regarding revocation of certificates. Id.
b. RFC 1424 (Ex. 1006)
RFC 1424 describes “key certification, certificate-revocation list
(CRL) storage, and CRL retrieval,” which are services supporting privacy
enhanced mail, as required by a CA. Ex. 1006, 1.

39

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
c. Obviousness of Claims 18–22 over
PKI Report and RFC 1424
Petitioner argues that PKI Report discloses each limitation of
independent claim 18 and dependent claims 19–22. Pet. at 38. Petitioner
states that PKI Report “is not explicit that the requester ‘self-signs’ a data
structure that it sends to the issuing authority to request a certificate in a
certificate request message and that the issuing authority returns the data
structure in a certificate signature reply” because PKI Report’s disclosure of
those aspects is summarizing disclosures of RFC 1424. Id. However,
Petitioner asserts RFC 1424 clearly discloses those limitations (as well as the
entirety of limitations “a” and “b” of independent claim 18) and that PKI
Report summarizes those disclosures. Id. at 38–39 (citing Ex. 1006, 2–3;
Ex. 1005, 129).
PKI Report explains that a goal of the study is to “design [a public
key] infrastructure that will allow users to establish chains of trust” and “to
facilitate trusted electronic correspondence beyond those users with whom
one has manually exchanged public keys.” Ex. 1005, 27. Petitioner points
to those, and various other disclosures in PKI Report relating to the
implementation of the disclosed PKI regarding managing public keys in a
hierarchical certificate management infrastructure, and argues that PKI
Report teaches the method of requesting and issuing public key certificates
in a secure certification system as recited in claim 18. Pet. 40.
PKI Report and RFC 1424 further describe a process for a user or CA
to obtain a public key certificate including sending a self-signed request
including the public key to an issuing CA and the issuing CA verifying the
signature on the request, generating and signing a certificate using its private

40

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
key, and sending the signed certificate back to the requester. Ex. 1005, 30,
65–66, 73, 129, 134; Ex. 1006, 2–5. Petitioner maps those disclosures of
PKI Report and RFC 1424 to the method steps of requesting and issuing a
public key certificate recited in independent claim 18. Pet. 40–43.
Petitioner asserts it would have been obvious to combine PKI Report
with RFC 1424 because PKI Report discloses an electronic transaction of a
requester requesting a certificate and an issuing CA returning a certificate to
the requester, and RFC 1424, which offers a known way of executing the
described transactions, is identified in PKI Report as a standard reviewed in
drafting PKI Report. Pet. 39 (citing Ex. 1005, 129). Therefore, Petitioner
asserts implementing the transactions disclosed by PKI Report with “the
specific certificate request and issuance features described by RFC 1424
would have been nothing more than applying a known technique to address
the mechanics of electronic requesting and issuing of a certificate,” and a
skilled artisan would have learned of RFC 1424 from PKI Report, such that
it would have at least been obvious to try such a solution. Id. at 40 (citing
Ex. 1001 ¶¶ 106–108).
Patent Owner argues neither PKI Report nor RFC 1424 discloses that
the components of the certification infrastructure are processes, and that
certification according to PKI Report and RFC 1424 requires manual
processing of certificates. PO Resp. 42–46. Patent Owner also argues that
Petitioner’s declarant, Dr. Naccache, testified that “RFC 1424 does not
disclose the data structure described in” claim 18. PO Resp. 46 (quoting Ex.
2014, 74:3–6). Dr. Naccache, however, was asked a different question—
namely “[i]s it your testimony that the self-signed certificate of RFC 1424
corresponds with the recited data structure?” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting

41

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Ex. 2014, 74:3–6). Prior to the quoted question and answer, Dr. Naccache
testified that RFC 1424 does disclose a data structure and that RFC 1424
also discloses self-signing that data structure as part of the certification
process. Ex. 1011, 73:8–74:15. Thus, Patent Owner’s argument regarding
Dr. Naccache’s testimony is based on, at best, a misreading of that
testimony.
Petitioner argues “occasional human assistance [in PKI Report] is
irrelevant given the clear disclosures of using emails and computer processes
in the certification process.” Reply 12. Petitioner also points to the portion
of PKI Report disclosing that the “term entity is used in this section to mean
any component of the PKI be they human or machine and include: users,
process, CAs, ORAs, CA operators and ORA operators.” Reply 11–12
(emphasis omitted).
We disagree with Patent Owner’s construction of performing a step
“at a computer process,” as excluding manual invocation or other human
intervention. For the reasons discussed above with respect to the disclosure
of the ’574 patent, our construction of computer process, and the disclosures
of PKI Report and RFC 1424, we find PKI Report and RFC 1424 disclose
using computer processes as part of the certification infrastructure. Thus, as
discussed above, the relevant inquiry is whether PKI Report teaches using
the computer processes as recited in the challenged claims.
As disclosed by PKI Report, one point of the study was to establish an
automated system for managing and distributing keys electronically. Ex.
1005, 23. Moreover, PKI report generally discloses that CAs (or other
entities) generate keys and verify and certify subordinates’ certificates. Id.
at 66. These disclosures of executing procedures regarding the generation

42

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
and analysis of electronic data structures involve the use of computer
processes. See, e.g., id. (“it was assumed that the user had either software or
hardware that was capable of generating the key pair for the user”). Because
PKI Report and RFC 1424 teach that generating a data structure, self-signing
the data structure, sending the signed data structure as a certificate signature
request, verifying the authenticity of the request, and certifying and
returning the data structure are functions involving computer processes to
create, modify, and transmit electronic data structures, Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the combination of
PKI Report and RFC 1424 teaches performing the method of claim 18.
Petitioner also provides arguments mapping various disclosures of
PKI Report to the additional limitations recited in claims 19–22, which
depend from claim 18. Pet. 43–45 (citing Ex. 1005, 31, 36, 38, 42, 44, 54,
55, 66, 71, 73, 74, 117). With respect to claim 19, Patent Owner only argues
patentability for the same reasons argued with respect to claim 18. PO Resp.
46.
Patent Owner asserts claim 20 is patentable because PKI Report
teaches each CA depositing certificates at different directory servers, which
is the opposite of a common repository. Id. at 46–47 (citing Ex. 1005, 54).
Patent Owner’s argument, however, is directed to a portion of PKI Report
discussing backup servers – i.e., the existence of multiple directory servers
to increase system reliability in case one directory server goes down. See
Ex. 1005, 54. That same section explains that a system employing a “hot
backup,” which holds “exactly the same information as the primary server,”
might have only one (replicated) repository for certificates. Id. Thus, even
under Patent Owner’s proposed construction, PKI Report discloses a

43

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
common repository. Moreover, even assuming that two directory servers are
not identical, PKI report teaches that each directory server could hold
multiple certificates and would therefore meet the broadest reasonable
construction of the recited common repository.
Patent Owner argues Petitioner has not established that the
certification process recited in claim 18 is performed when adding a new
entity to the infrastructure, as recited in claim 21. PO Resp. 47–48. Patent
Owner argues claim 22, which depends from claim 21, is patentable for the
same reasons as asserted with respect to claim 21. Id. at 48. Petitioner
asserts PKI Report teaches that new CAs may be required, and that addition
of a new CA requires certification from an appropriate PCA. Pet. 44–45;
Reply 13. We are persuaded by Petitioner’s argument.
Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the subject matter of
claims 18–22 would have been obvious in view of PKI Report and RFC
1424.
d. Anticipation of Claims 23–27 by PKI Report or
Obviousness of Claim 25 over PKI Report
PKI Report discloses that a recipient may receive a certification path
from the sender along with the signed document received. Ex. 1005, 67. As
discussed above, a certification path includes each CA in the path between
the sender and the common point of trust. Id. at 27. Based on those
disclosures, Petitioner maps the receipt of the certification path to “obtaining
a public key certificate for every computer process in the infrastructure
between the sender and a common point of trust in the infrastructure,” as
recited in claim 23. Pet. 46–47 (citing Ex. 1005, 26, 27, 35, 66, 67). PKI

44

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Report further discloses verifying each certificate in the path, starting with
the certificate signed by the common point of trust and iteratively using the
decrypted key to verify the certificate at the next lower level in the hierarchy
until the certificate of the CA that signed the sender’s certificate is verified.
Ex. 1005, 67–68. Petitioner maps that disclosure of PKI Report and other
disclosures to “verifying the authenticity of signatures iteratively, beginning
with the common point of trust,” as recited in claim 23. Pet. 47–48 (citing
Ex. 1005, 26, 37, 67–68, 72, 127, 132).
Patent Owner argues PKI Report does not anticipate claim 23 because
PKI Report does not teach that CAs are processes and only teaches obtaining
“one or more” additional certificates to verify a sender’s certificate. PO
Resp. 48–49. We do not agree with Patent Owner regarding its assertion
about processes for the reasons already discussed above. We also are not
persuaded by Patent Owner’s assertions that PKI Report’s disclosure of
obtaining “one or more” additional certificates does not meet the recited step
of obtaining a certificate for every process between the sender and the
common point of trust.
First, in the simple case where there are no intervening processes
between the sender and the common point of trust, PKI Report explicitly
indicates that it would obtain a certificate for every process. Second, it is
clear from the context that the reference in PKI Report to the possible need
for a recipient to “obtain one or more additional certificates . . . in order to
verify the signature on the sender’s certificate” is a general statement that
the sender’s certificate (unless it is the common point of trust) will not be
enough to verify the signature on the sender’s certificate. Ex. 1005, 67. PKI
Report explains that a certification path includes every process between the

45

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
sender and a common point of trust and that, a recipient receives a
certification path along with a signed document and must obtain all
certificates within the certification path. Id. at 27, 67–68.
Claims 24–27 depend from claim 23. Claim 24 further recites that “a
public key certificate for every computer process in the infrastructure
between the sender and a common point of trust is also verified against all
relevant certificate revocation lists.” Petitioner points to PKI Report’s
disclosure of checking each certificate being verified against CRLs. Pet. 48
(quoting Ex. 1005, 67–68, 72). Patent Owner only argues that claim 24 is
patentable for the same reasons as argued with respect to claim 23. PO
Resp. 49. As discussed above, we find the scope of claims 25–27 to be the
same as the scope of claim 23. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, we
find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
claims 23–27 are anticipated by PKI Report. For the same reasons, we also
find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
claim 25 would have been obvious4 in view of PKI Report.
e. Anticipation of Claims 28 and 29 by PKI Report or
Obviousness of Claim 29 over PKI Report
PKI Report discloses checking each certificate against the appropriate
CRL before using it, which Petitioner maps to the method of validating a
public key certificate using CRLs, as recited in claim 28. Pet. 51–52 (citing
4

Petitioner alternatively challenges claim 25 as obvious in view of PKI
Report. Because we determine it is of the same scope as claim 23, and we
find claim 23 is anticipated by PKI Report, it follows that claim 25 would
have been obvious in view of PKI Report. See, e.g., Cohesive Techs., Inc. v.
Waters Corp., 543 F.3d 1351, 1364–65 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (explaining
distinctions between anticipation and obviousness, but noting that “prior art
references that anticipate a claim will usually render that claim obvious”).
46

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Ex. 1005, 23, 27, 67–68, 72–73). PKI Report also discloses that a user may
store CRLs locally, which Petitioner maps to “retrieved certificate
revocation lists are stored locally in the computer at which the certificate is
being validated,” as recited in dependent claim 29. Id. at 52 (citing Ex.
1005, 70, 118, 161, 169). Petitioner further argues that, “[t]o the extent it is
determined that PKI Study does not disclose local storage of retrieved CRLs
at the computer at which the certificate is being validated as recited in claim
29, that additional limitation would have been obvious to the skilled person.”
Id. at 52–53 (citing Ex. 1001 ¶ 116). In particular, Petitioner argues storing
the CRL locally would have been a design choice and that is one of a finite
number of solutions (storing CRLs locally, consulting a remote database).
Id. at 53. Petitioner asserts that storing the CRLs locally, at least while
executing the validation process, would have been a preferred design choice
in order to avoid working with a remote database during the validation
process. Id.
With respect to claim 28, Patent Owner argues PKI Report does not
disclose that CAs or other certification infrastructure components are
processes, so it does not disclose using CRLs “of each computer process.”
PO Resp. 53–54. PKI Report discloses that each CA is responsible for
generating CRLs for all of the certificates it issues and, as Petitioner argues,
PKI Report discloses checking appropriate CRLs. Pet. 51–52; see Ex. 1005,
27, 44–45, 67, 70. PKI Report discusses various ways of storing and
retrieving CRLs, but regardless of the chosen implementation, a CRL
associated with a CA in PKI Report meets the recited limitation of a CRL of
a computer process because the processes executing the CA function are the
processes that would create and maintain the CRL associated with that CA.

47

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Thus, because each CA has an associated CRL and every certificate between
the sender and a common point of trust is verified against an appropriate
CRL, it follows that PKI Report discloses checking the CRL for each
process between the sender and a common point of trust. See Ex. 1005, 27,
44–45, 67, 70.
Patent Owner argues only that claim 29, which depends from claim
28, is patentable for at least the same reasons as asserted with respect to
claim 28. PO Resp. 54. For the reasons discussed above, we find Petitioner
has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 28 and 29
are anticipated by PKI Report. For the same reasons, we also find Petitioner
has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 29 would
have been obvious5 in view of PKI Report.
f. Anticipation of Claim 30 by PKI Report or
Obviousness of Claim 30 over PKI Report
PKI Report’s disclosure of iteratively updating certificates is similar
to the iterative update procedure disclosed in Kapidzic and the ’574 patent.
Specifically, PKI Report recognizes that certificates may expire or become
compromised, resulting in revocation of certificates, which will require the
entities to generate new keys and request new signed certificates from an
issuing CA. Ex. 1005, 69–71. PKI Report also recognizes the need for a
CA with a compromised key to reissue all certificates it generated using its
new key. Id. at 70. Thus, for each subordinate CA, the process would be
5

Petitioner alternatively challenges claim 29 as obvious in view of PKI
Report. Because we determine Petitioner has demonstrated that claim 29 is
anticipated by PKI Report, it follows that claim 29 also would have been
obvious in view of PKI Report. See, e.g., Cohesive Techs., 543 F.3d at
1364–65.
48

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
repeated until all subordinates in the hierarchy were updated. PKI Report
further discloses that an entity with a compromised certificate will notify its
parent CA, which will place the compromised certificate on a CRL. Id. at
69. Petitioner maps those disclosures, and others, of PKI Report to the
method of updating certificates recited in claim 30. Pet. 53–56 (citing Ex.
1005, 22, 27, 69–71, 134, 162–67). Petitioner further argues that, to the
extent PKI Report does not explicitly disclose iteratively distributing new
certificates until all subordinate processes have been updated, as recited in
claim 30, it would have been obvious to an ordinarily skilled artisan. Id. at
56–57 (citing Ex. 1001 ¶ 120). Petitioner argues that PKI Report explicitly
discloses updating a child process (the entities for which a CA with a newly
registered certificate issues certificates), and that a skilled artisan would
have understood that, if any of those child processes also were CAs that
issued certificates to their respective subordinates, those certificates would
need to be reissued as well in order to maintain proper certification paths.
Id. at 56–57.
Patent Owner argues claim 30 is patentable over PKI Report for
essentially the same reasons asserted with respect to the challenge based on
Kapidzic – i.e., PKI Report does not disclose processes and PKI Report does
not disclose copying the new certificate to all subordinate processes. PO
Resp. 54–57. Patent Owner also argues Petitioner’s obviousness analysis is
“defective as a matter of law,” because the Petition “use[s] ‘common sense’
to supply a missing element not taught in any reference of record rather than
as rationale for combining references.” Id. at 57 (citing K/S HIMPP v.
Hear-Wear Techs., LLC, 751 F.3d 1362, 1365–66 (Fed. Cir. 2014)).

For the same reasons discussed above, we disagree with Patent
Owner’s implicit construction of claim 30. We find Petitioner has
demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 30 is
anticipated by PKI Report. We also disagree with Patent Owner’s
application of K/S HIMPP. See PO Resp. 57. We agree with Petitioner’s
statement that the Petition’s application of “common sense” was in support
of a rationale for modifying PKI Report to include distributing a certificate
to all subordinates, to the extent that was not explicitly disclosed. See Reply
14–15. Because Petitioner has presented a sufficient rationale, supported by
testimony (see Ex. 1001 ¶ 120), for modifying PKI Report to the extent
necessary, we further find Petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that claim 30 would have been obvious in view of PKI
Report.
g. Anticipation of Claim 31 by PKI Report
As discussed above, PKI Report describes adding new CAs to the
hierarchy and storing certificates at both an issuing CA and the entity (a user
or CA) that requested a signed certificate. Ex. 1005, 55. PKI Report
discusses various hierarchical arrangements of a certificate management
system. Id. at 22, 27, 36–38, 42, 44–45, 48–51. PKI Report also discloses
creating and signing certificates, and storing those certificates at various
points in the hierarchy. Id. at 44–45, 66, 73, 117, 134. Petitioner maps
those disclosures of PKI Report to the method of adding a new process to
the infrastructure recited in claim 31. Pet. 57–59.
Patent Owner argues PKI Report teaches adding a PCA and new CAs
but does not teach “adding a new component to a representation of a
certification infrastructure,” as recited in claim 31. PO Resp. 57–58. Patent

50

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Owner also argues that PKI Report “does not disclose a certificate storage
database at any CA,” and PKI Report does not teach processes. Id. at 59–60.
Petitioner argues PKI Report states that each entity has a unique name
that distinguishes it from every other PKI entity. Reply 15. PKI Report
explains that the unique names may be “formed by concatenating a sequence
of locally unique names of some hierarchical substructure of the PKI.” Id.
(citing Ex. 1005, 27, 55 n.4). Petitioner, therefore, argues “the name alone is
a representation of the location where the entity is added.” Id.
We agree with Petitioner that PKI Report discloses processes and a
certificate storage database at CAs. See Pet. 58 (quoting Ex. 1005, 117 (“the
CA will need to store and retrieve the certificates it generates”)). Moreover,
we agree with Petitioner that the naming convention disclosed in PKI
represents the location of that particular entity in the infrastructure. See
Reply 15. However, we find Petitioner has not pointed to anything in PKI
Report that discloses “adding a new component to a representation of a
certification infrastructure.” Specifically, although Petitioner points to a
portion of PKI Report that discloses adding an entity to the infrastructure,
and the assigned unique name may indicate the location of the entity within
the infrastructure, Petitioner does not point to a disclosure of adding a
component to a representation of the certification. As an analogy, if a
parent has a daughter and names her by appending “Jill” to a concatenation
of the child’s ancestors’ names, Jill is added to the family and has a unique
name indicating her lineage, but Jill is not added to a representation of the
family (e.g., a family tree diagram) merely by the assignment of a unique
name. Adding Jill to her family tree diagram is a separate step. Therefore,
on this record, we find Petitioner has not demonstrated, by a preponderance

51

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
of the evidence, that the subject matter of claim 31 is anticipated by PKI
Report.
C. Patent Owner’s Motions to Exclude Evidence
Patent Owner moves to exclude, under 37 C.F.R. § 42.64(c), PKI
Report and RFC 1424 (Exhibits 1005, 1006, respectively) and Exhibits I–O
attached to the Declaration of Mr. Jeffrey White. Paper 32 (“Mot.”). First,
we address Patent Owner’s motion with respect to Exhibits I–O, which are
attached to Mr. White’s Declaration, as inadmissible hearsay offered to
prove the truth of the alleged publication date of PKI Report and RFC 1424.
Id. at 7–8; Paper 38, 5 (“PO Reply”).
Petitioner suggests Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude with respect to
portions of Mr. White’s Declaration can be dismissed as moot because, to
the extent Petitioner has established the admissibility of PKI Report and
RFC 1424, the Declaration is unnecessary. Paper 36, 10 (“Opp.”).
Nevertheless, Petitioner argues all of Patent Owner’s objections to
Mr. White’s Declaration are based on an assertion that the dates in Exhibits
I–O of the Declaration are offered to prove the truth of the publication dates.
Id. at 10–11.
Petitioner argues the date in Exhibit K is not being offered to prove
the publication date of PKI Report, but rather as evidence that Defense
Technical Information Center (“DTIC”) indexed and catalogued PKI Report
in a manner assigning it a date of April 1994. Opp. 12. Petitioner asserts
Exhibit K provides circumstantial evidence of public availability prior to
December 1995. Id.
Exhibit K to Mr. White’s Declaration is offered merely to support
Mr. White’s testimony that a document identical to PKI Report is currently

52

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
publicly available on the DTIC website and that the document is marked
with a date of April 1, 1994. See Ex. 1012 ¶¶ 19–20; Opp. 12. Because the
document is not being offered to prove PKI Report actually was published
on April 1, 1994, or for the truth of any statement made in the document, we
deny Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude with respect to Exhibit K to
Mr. White’s declaration.
Exhibits I (a copy of Ex. 1005 - PKI Report) and J (a copy of
allegedly the same report downloaded from the DTIC website) are not
offered to prove any statement made within those documents, but rather to
serve as a basis for Mr. White’s testimony that PKI Report is identical to
Exhibit J. See Ex. 1012 ¶¶ 16–20. Therefore, we deny Patent Owner’s
Motion to Exclude with respect to Exhibits I and J because the statements
are not hearsay.
Petitioner argues Exhibits N and O are being offered to demonstrate
“that the RFC Editor maintains an index and record of RFC 1424 (N-1) and
that an RFC publication process exists (O-1-O-3).” Opp. 12. Petitioner
asserts Exhibits N and O are offered to show “that RFCs are intended to be
published at all and an RFC document completed in February 1993 would
have been publically available prior to December 1995.” Id.
Exhibit N is offered as evidence to support Mr. White’s testimony that
RFC 1424 is currently publicly available at the RFC Editor website – i.e.,
http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc1424.txt.pdf, and that the document is
marked with a date of February 1993. See Ex. 1012 ¶ 23, p. N-1; Opp. 12.
Because Exhibit N is not being offered to prove RFC 1424 actually was
published in February 1993, or for the truth of any statement made in the

53

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
document, we deny Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude with respect to
Exhibit N to Mr. White’s declaration.
Exhibit O is offered as evidence that RFCs are intended to be
published and that an RFC completed in February 1993 would have been
publicly available before December 1995. Accordingly, the statements
Petitioner relies on in Exhibit O are statements asserted for the truth of the
matter asserted. See Ex. 1012 ¶ 24; Opp. 12. Because Petitioner relies on
statements in Exhibit O regarding publication procedures in support of its
assertion that RFC 1424 was publicly available as of February 1993, we
grant Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude with respect to Exhibit O to
Mr. White’s declaration.
Exhibits L (a copy of Ex. 1006 - RFC 1424) and M (a copy of RFC
1424 downloaded from the RFC Editor website) are not offered to prove any
statement made within those documents. See Ex. 1012 ¶¶ 21–23. Therefore,
we deny Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude with respect to Exhibits L and
M.
Patent Owner moves to exclude PKI Report and RFC 1424 for lack of
foundation, because the references have not been shown to be a prior art
printed publication. Mot. 1, 4. Specifically, Patent Owner argues Petitioner
has not explained how PKI Report or RFC 1424 is prior art and that
Petitioner’s supplemental evidence does not cure Patent Owner’s objection.
Id. at 2, 4–5. Patent Owner argues a patent owner may argue both
admissibility in a motion to exclude and sufficiency in a patent owner
response, and that the right to argue sufficiency of evidence is not waived by
failure to object to the admissibility of evidence. PO Reply 1–2, 5.

54

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Petitioner responds that Patent Owner’s foundation objections to PKI
Report and RFC 1424 are merely an attempt to argue the sufficiency of
Petitioner’s evidence in support of whether PKI Report and RFC 1424 are
printed publications as of the alleged date, which Petitioner argues Patent
Owner waived by not raising in the Patent Owner Response. Opp. 2–4, 7–8.
Patent Owner is correct that it may argue sufficiency of evidence in a
Patent Owner Response and inadmissibility of evidence in a motion to
exclude. Petitioner, however, is not arguing that Patent Owner waived its
right argue admissibility of PKI Report or RFC 1424. See Opp. 3
(“Moreover, IV’s ‘foundation’ argument is not really about the admissibility
of evidence but is actually an attempt to argue the sufficiency of the
evidence” (emphasis added)), 7. Importantly, Patent Owner never
challenged the sufficiency of the evidence in its Patent Owner Response.
Thus, Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude is improper to the extent it asserts
Petitioner has not sufficiently demonstrated public accessibility of either PKI
Report or RFC 1424.
Patent Owner also asserts statements made within PKI Report and
RFC 1424, upon which Petitioner relies to establish the publication date of
the references, are statements made outside of this trial and, accordingly,
constitute hearsay that should be excluded. Mot. 3, 6. Additionally, Patent
Owner argues that, although it waived its authenticity objection to PKI
Report and RFC 1424, it did not concede that the documents are authentic.
PO Reply 1, 5. In particular, Patent Owner asserts Petitioner still has the
burden to establish authenticity for the ancient document hearsay exception
to apply. Id. at 2–3, 5.

55

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Petitioner argues Patent Owner conceded that PKI Report and RFC
1424 are both relevant and authentic by failing to object to their relevance
and failing to move to exclude the documents after making an objection to
their authenticity. Opp. 2, 8. Petitioner further argues that PKI Report and
RFC 1424 are authentic and subject to hearsay exceptions because they are
both ancient documents under Rule 803(16) of the Federal Rules of
Evidence. Id. at 4. Although Petitioner states that Patent Owner conceded
authenticity, Petitioner asserts the evidence establishes authenticity of the
documents under Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 901(b)(8). Id. at 4 n.1,
8 n.3.
We agree with Patent Owner that its failure move to exclude PKI
Report and RFC 1424 as authentic does not obviate the requirement to
determine that the documents are authentic before we may apply the ancient
document exception to hearsay. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(16) (“a document . . .
whose authenticity is established”). Nevertheless, we find both PKI Report
and RFC 1424 to be authentic. The evidence submitted supports the
authenticity of PKI Report. In particular, each of PKI Report and RFC 1424
is “in a condition that creates no suspicion about its authenticity.” See Fed.
R. Evid. 901(8)(A). Both documents appear consistent with their citation to
other articles or papers that are contemporaneous to the time at which they
are alleged to have been published. Furthermore, we do not find anything in
the content of either paper or any odd markings to cast doubt on the
authenticity of the documents. Additionally, PKI Report is available for
download at a page on the DTIC website, which is a place where PKI Report
would likely be, if authentic. See Fed. R. Evid. 901(8)(B). Similarly, RFC
1424 is available for download at a page on the RFC Editor website, which

56

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
is a place where RFC 1424 would likely be, if authentic. See id. Finally, the
same evidence already discussed regarding contemporaneous documents and
uncontested dates of other documents, particularly Kapidzic, that reference
PKI Report and RFC 1424 provide circumstantial evidence regarding the
fact that the document is 20 years old. Additionally, the evidence supports a
finding that PKI Report is authentic because it is a document recorded in a
public office (DTIC) and is a purported record from the DTIC, which
authenticates the document as a public record. See Fed. R. Evid. 901(7).
Patent Owner further argues that every basis Petitioner asserts to
establish that PKI Report and RFC 1424 are 20 years old, and subject to the
hearsay exception for ancient documents, is itself a hearsay statement. PO
Reply 3–5. Patent Owner also argues the residual hearsay exception should
not apply in this case because it is reserved for exceptional circumstances
and because Petitioner did not “give reasonable notice before the trial or
hearing under FRE 807(b) because it cited these exhibits in the Reply.” Id.
at 4.
As mentioned above, Petitioner argues PKI Report and RFC1424 are
admissible under the ancient document hearsay exception. Opp. 4.
Petitioner argues PKI Report and RFC 1424 are “admissible under the
residual exception in FRE 807 . . . [because Patent Owner] had reasonable
notice under FRE 807(b), and all the requirements of FRE 807(a) are met.”
Id. at 6, 9. Petitioner points to the SF298 included in PKI Report and online
records from the DTIC associating PKI Report with an April 1994 date as
statements of material fact having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of
trustworthiness and being “the most probative of the point for which they are
offered” regarding PKI Report. Id. at 6–7 (citing Ex. 1012 ¶¶ 18–20, K-1).

57

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
Petitioner points to statements in Kapidzic and PKI Report that RFC 1424
was published in February 1993 as statements of material fact having
equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and being “the most
probative of the point for which [they are] offered” regarding RFC 1424. Id.
at 9–10 (citing Ex. 1012 ¶¶ 22–24, N-1).
With respect to RFC 1424, Petitioner further argues references in
Kapidzic and PKI Report to RFC 1424 establish that RFC 1424 was
available before both Kapidzic and PKI Report. Opp. 8–9. Petitioner asserts
the statements concerning RFC 1424 are admissible because the statements:
are offered for the non-hearsay purpose of proving RFC 1424 was available
prior to December 1995; qualify as an exception to hearsay under Federal
Rule of Evidence 803(16); and were not objected to by Patent Owner as
hearsay. Id. at 9.
We agree with Petitioner that, the dates in PKI Report and RFC 1424
are admissible as an exception to hearsay under both the ancient documents
exception and the residual exception for all of the reasons asserted by
Petitioner. Moreover, we find PKI Report is admissible as an exception to
hearsay under the public records exception. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(8).
Specifically, we find the evidence supports a finding that PKI Report and
RFC 1424 are authentic ancient documents and, therefore, the statements in
those documents are admissible under the ancient document exception to
hearsay. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(16). We also agree with Petitioner that the
circumstantial evidence summarized herein provide the sufficient
circumstantial evidence that the documents are what they purport to be and
were produced at the time indicated in the respective document. Moreover,
we do not agree with Patent Owner’s position that it did not receive

58

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
sufficient notice that Petitioner intended to rely on the dates that Patent
Owner now moves to exclude as hearsay. In particular, the Petition asserted
that PKI Report was published in April 1994 and RFC 1424 was published
in February 1993, qualifying each document as prior art under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b). Pet. 4–5. Finally, as discussed above, we find PKI Report is a
public record because it sets out the activities carried out by DTIC in
researching PKI alternatives, and Patent Owner does direct us to any
indication that the information sources or any other circumstances lack
trustworthiness. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(8).
Accordingly, we deny Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude Evidence
with respect to Exhibits 1005 (PKI Report) and 1006 (RFC 1424).
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we determine that Petitioner has
demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 18–21 and 23–
31 of the ’574 patent are unpatentable as anticipated by Kapidzic, claims 18–
22 are unpatentable as obvious over PKI Report and RFC 1424, claims 23–
30 are anticipated by PKI Report, and claims 25, 29, and 30 are unpatentable
as obvious over PKI Report.
IV. ORDER
Accordingly, it is:
ORDERED that claims 18–31 of the ’574 patent are determined to be
unpatentable;
FURTHER ORDERED that Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude
Evidence is granted with respect to White Declaration Exhibit O;

59

IPR2014-00724
Patent 5,745,574
FURTHER ORDERED that Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude
Evidence is denied with respect to Exhibits 1005, 1006, and the White
Declaration Exhibits I–N; and
FURTHER ORDERED that, because this is a Final Written Decision,
parties to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must
comply with the notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
