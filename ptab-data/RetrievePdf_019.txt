Patent 5,530,597
I. INTRODUCTION
Nissan North America, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition on April 1,
2014, requesting an inter partes review of claims 6–9 of U.S. Patent No.
5,530,597 (“the ’597 patent”). (Paper 1, “Pet.”) Patent Owner, Norman IP
Holdings, LLC, waived the Preliminary Response to the Petition. Paper 7.
On September 23, 2014, we instituted an inter partes review of claims 6–9
on the following grounds of unpatentability alleged in the Petition:
A. Claims 6–9 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over Tokiwa1
and Smith;2
B. Claims 6–9 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over Katayose3
and Smith; and
C. Claims 6 and 7 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) over
Smith.
Paper 18 (“Dec.”), 21.
After institution of trial, Patent Owner filed a Patent Owner Response
(Paper 24, “PO Resp.” ) and Petitioner filed a Reply thereto (Paper 27, “Pet.
Reply”). Additionally, Patent Owner filed a Motion to Exclude certain
evidence (Paper 29, “Mot. Excl.”), which Petitioner opposes (Paper 33,
“Opp.”). In response to Petitioner’s Opposition, Patent Owner filed a Reply
to Petitioner’s Opposition (Paper 34, “PO Reply to Mot. Excl.”).
An oral argument was held on June 1, 2015. The transcript of the oral
hearing has been entered into the record. Paper 35 (“Tr.”).

Patent 5,530,597
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c). This Final Written
Decision is issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73.
Petitioner has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims
6–9 of the ’597 patent are unpatentable.
A. Related Proceedings
Claims 1–6, 10, and 11 of the ’597 patent were the subject of Ex Parte
Reexamination No. 90/012,781, filed on February 4, 2013. Ex. 1010, 2, 5.
This reexamination resulted in Ex Parte Reexamination 5,530,597
Certificate C1, issued April 17, 2014 (“’597 C1”), indicating that claims 1–
5, 10, and 11 were cancelled, the patentability of claim 6 was confirmed, and
claims 7–9 were not reexamined. Ex. 3001.
Claims 1–6, 10, and 11 of the ’597 patent were also the subject of a
request for a second Ex Parte Reexamination No. 90/012,901, filed by third
party requestor ARM, Inc. on June 27, 2013. That request was denied on
August 27, 2013. Ex. 1010, 3–4. Third party requestor ARM, Inc. filed a
Petition for review of the denial on September 25, 2013. On April 23, 2014,
ARM, Inc.’s Petition for review was dismissed as moot in view of the ’597
C1 certificate. Ex. 3002.
For other related proceedings, Petitioner provides a list of related
matters in various federal district courts. Pet. 2–5.
B. The ’597 Patent
The ’597 patent describes interrupt controllers with interrupts that
may be masked by software. Ex. 1001, 1:54–56. More particularly, the
’597 patent describes an interrupt enable circuit “capable of allowing an
interrupt to be enabled and disabled by software at any time except under
conditions, dictated by hardware, at which time the interrupt becomes nonmaskable.” Id. at 3:9–12. Figure 2 of the ’597 patent is reproduced below.
3

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597

Figure 2 depicts an interrupt enable circuit that provides a maskable
interrupt that becomes a “non-maskable interrupt while the processor is in
the idle mode.” Id. at 5:51–52. Generally, when the SOFTWARE
ENABLE signal is high, the interrupt request signal, INTO, will generate an
interrupt. Id. at 5:21–23. When the SOFTWARE ENABLE signal is low,
the interrupt is masked. Id. at 5:24–25. However, IDLE INDICATOR
CIRCUIT 22 provides an IDLE signal on line 24 while the processor is in
idle mode. Id. at 5:54–56. The IDLE signal is received with the
SOFTWARE ENABLE signal by OR gate 28. Id. at 5:56–57. Thus, when
the processor is in an idle mode, IDLE INDICATOR CIRCUIT 22 will
assert an IDLE signal and cause the output of OR gate 28 to go high
regardless of the state of the SOFTWARE ENABLE signal on line 26. Id. at
5:61–65. “As long as the OR gate output 28 remains at a high level . . . [the]
INTO [signal] on line 4 will set latch 10, thus generating the interrupt.” Id.
at 5:65–6:1. When the processor is not in the idle mode, the IDLE signal on
line 24 remains low, and the enabling and disabling of the interrupt will be
determined by the SOFTWARE ENABLE signal on line 26. Id. at 6:7–10.
C. Illustrative Claim
Challenged claims 6–9 depend directly or indirectly from claims 1, 4,
and/or 5, which were cancelled by the Ex Parte Reexamination No.

state comprises an idle mode.
II. ANALYSIS
A. Claim Construction
The ’597 patent has expired. See Pet. 8. The Board’s review of the
claims of an expired patent is similar to that of a district court’s review. In
re Rambus Inc., 694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 2012). We are, therefore, guided
by the principle that the words of a claim “are generally given their ordinary
and customary meaning” as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the
5

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
art in question at the time of the invention. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d
1303, 1312–13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal citation omitted).
1. “first logic circuitry” and “second logic circuitry” (claims 6–9)
Although the parties do not expressly propose a construction for any
claim term (Pet. 7–8; PO Resp. 8; Tr. 37:18–38:25), the parties nonetheless
dispute whether the terms “first logic circuitry” and “second logic circuitry”
of the “interrupt mask disable circuit” required by claims 6–9,4 exclude an
AND gate and an OR gate respectively (Tr. 37:23–38:8; 45:24–48:7)5.
Specifically, Patent Owner asserts that an AND gate alone does not satisfy
the limitations of a “first logic circuitry” and an OR gate alone does not meet
the limitations of a “second logic circuitry.” Id. at 37:23–38:8. According
to Patent Owner, independent claim 1 excludes the embodiment disclosed in
Figure 2 of the ’597 patent, and, thus, claims 6–9, which depend from claim
1, do not cover AND gate 6 (Fig. 2) as a “first logic circuitry” and OR gate
28 (Fig. 2) as a “second logic circuitry.” Tr. 38:11–42:1.
Petitioner disagrees with Patent Owner’s reading of “first logic
circuitry” and “second logic circuitry” as excluding the embodiment shown
in Figure 2 of the ’597 patent. Tr. 45:24–48:7. For the “second logic
circuitry,” Petitioner asserts that excluding an OR gate alone would ignore
the literal language of claim 8, which directly depends from claim 1 and
recites that the “second logic circuitry comprises an OR gate.” Tr. 46:7–
47:11. Similarly, Petitioner asserts that excluding an AND gate alone from
4

The terms “first logic circuitry” and “second logic circuitry” are recited in
cancelled claim 1 from which challenged claims 6–9 depend.
5
We note that, as explained below in Section _III_, Patent Owner
improperly included these arguments only in a Motion to Exclude.
However, even if we consider those arguments we are not persuaded by
them.
6

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
meeting the “first logic circuitry” would contradict the express language of
dependent claim 9, which recites “the first logic circuitry comprises an AND
gate.” Id.
To start, we note that a general principle of claim construction
counsels against interpreting claim terms in a way that excludes
embodiments disclosed in the specification. Oatey Co. v. IPS Corp.,
514 F.3d 1271, 1276–77 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (“We normally do not interpret
claim terms in a way that excludes embodiments disclosed in the
specification”); see e.g., Verizon Servs. Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp.,
503 F.3d 1295, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (rejecting proposed claim
interpretation that would exclude disclosed examples in the specification);
Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Mfg., L.P., 327 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir.
2003) (finding district court’s claim construction erroneously excluded an
embodiment described in an example in the specification, where the
prosecution history showed no such disavowal of claim scope); NeoMagic
Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., 287 F.3d 1062, 1074 (Fed. Cir. 2002)
(“It is elementary that a claim construction that excludes the preferred
embodiment ‘is rarely, if ever correct and would require highly persuasive
evidentiary support.”’) (quoting Vitronics Corp. v Conceptronic, Inc., 90
F.3d 1576, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).
Here, Patent Owner’s construction of “first logic circuitry” and
“second logic circuitry” would exclude most, if not all, of the embodiments
disclosed in the ’597 patent. Generally, a construction that excludes all
disclosed embodiments is especially disfavored. Kaneka Corp. v. Xiamen
Kingdomway Group Company, Nos. 2014-1373, 2014-1399, 2015 WL
3613644, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Jun 10, 2015). For example, claim 6 depends from
cancelled claim 1 and includes the “first logic circuitry” and “second logic
7

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
circuitry” recited in Claim 1. Claim 6 further depends from cancelled claims
4 and 5, and requires that the mask override signal (of the second logic
circuitry) is enabled based on a hardware condition that occurs when a
processor is in an idle mode. In describing the idle mode operation, the ’597
patent refers to IDLE INDICATOR CIRCUIT 22 in the circuitry of three
embodiments depicted in Figures 2, 3, and 4. Ex. 1001, 5:53–56, 6:33–55.
In each of Figures 2, 3, and 4, the ’597 patent shows that a single OR gate,
OR gate 28 alone, receives SOFTWARE ENABLE signal 26 (e.g., mask
activation signal) and IDLE signal 24/EXTERNAL SIGNAL 32 (e.g., “mask
override signal”). OR gate 28 also generates a signal (e.g., mask signal) that
is input into a single AND gate, AND gate 6. Ex. 1001, 5:61–65. The ’597
patent also shows AND gate 6 alone receives INTO signal 4 (e.g., interrupt
request) and outputs a signal to interrupt flag IE0 10. Id. at Figs. 2–4. Thus,
we do not agree with Patent Owner that the embodiments shown in Figure
2–4 exclude an OR gate alone (e.g., OR gate 28) from a “second logic
circuitry” and an AND gate alone (e.g., AND gate 6) from a “first logic
circuitry.”
Additionally, Figures 5a, 5b, 6, and 7 incorporate the circuitry shown
in Figure 2. Ex. 1001, 6:64–7:2 (“FIG. 5 shows a block diagram of an
integrated circuit . . . having the interrupt enable circuit shown in FIG. 2”),
7:28–30 (“FIGS. 6 and 7 describe[] how the IC of FIG. 5 may be
incorporated into the handset unit and base unit [of] a cordless telephone.”).
Thus, the embodiments described in Figures 5a, 5b, 6, and 7 also include
AND gate 6 alone as a first logic circuitry and OR gate 28 alone as a second
logic circuitry. Further, remaining Figure 1 of the ’597 describes the prior
art, not an embodiment of a disclosed invention in the ’597 patent. Id. at
4:3.
8

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
Additionally, Patent Owner argues that claim 1 should be interpreted
to exclude embodiments of the patented invention where those embodiments
are clearly disclaimed in the specification. Tr. 39:5–16; see North Am.
Container, Inc. v. Plastipak Packaging, Inc., 415 F.3d 1335, 1345–46 (Fed.
Cir. 2005) (excluding from claim scope certain embodiments in the drawings
based on disclaimer during prosecution); see also SciMed Life Sys., Inc. v.
Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., 242 F.3d 1337, 1344 (Fed.Cir.2001)
(excluding subject matter from claim scope based on clear disclaimer in the
specification), or prosecution history. However, such a construction requires
“highly persuasive evidentiary support.” Adams Respiratory Therapeutics,
Inc. v. Perrigo Co., 616 F.3d 1283, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Vitronics
Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1583–84 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).
Based on the complete record before us, Patent Owner has not
provided persuasive evidentiary support for its construction. Patent Owner
contends that the signals shown in Figure 2 of the ’597 patent do not
correspond to the logical relationship required by claim 1. See Tr. 41:8–
42:1. Referring to Figure 2, Patent Owner argues that element 4 is an
interrupt request signal and the output signal from gate 28 is a mask signal.
According to Patent Owner, “the interrupt signal and the interrupt request
signal are both on when the mask gate is off. And that is impossible when
you have an AND gate. An AND gate requires that both inputs to be on for
the output to be on.” Id. at 41:22–25. In response, Petitioner agrees that
INT0 line 4 is an “interrupt request” and the output of OR gate 28 is a mask
signal. Tr. 47:17–48:7.
Looking to the Specification, we do not agree with Patent Owner that
the Specification disclaims or excludes Figure 2 from the scope of the “first
logic circuitry” and “second logic circuitry” limitations recited in claim 1
9

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
and required in claim 6. For convenience, Figure 2 of the ’597 patent is
reproduced below.

Referring to Figure 2, the ’597 patent teaches that when idle indicator circuit
22 asserts an idle signal on line 24, the output of OR gate 28 is “high
regardless of the state of the SOFTWARE ENABLE signal on line 26.” Ex.
1001, 5:61–65. The ’597 patent further teaches that “[a]s long as the OR
gate output 28 remains at a high level, the assertion of the interrupt request
signal INTO on line 4 will set latch 10, thus generating the interrupt.” Ex.
1001, 5:65–6:1.
Based on this disclosure, the ’597 patent teaches that a high output of
gate 28, which the parties agree is a “mask signal,” would not mask the
interrupt request, and a low output of gate 28 would not generate an interrupt
through AND gate 6, thus masking the interrupt. In other words, the ’597
patent teaches that the output of gate 28 is a mask signal that is disabled/off
when output of the gate 28 is high, and active/on when the output of OR gate
28 is low. With this relationship in mind, we do not agree with Patent
Owner that it would be “impossible” that “the interrupt signal and the
interrupt request signal are both on when the mask gate is off.” See Tr.
41:22–25. As discussed, the output of OR gate 28 is high when masking is
disabled/off, thus, “[a]s long as the OR gate output 28 remains at a high

10

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
level, the assertion of the interrupt request signal INTO on line 4 will set
latch 10, thus generating the interrupt.” Ex. 1001, 5:65–6:1.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded that “first logic circuitry” and
“second logic circuitry” excludes an AND gate alone and OR gate alone
respectively as Patent Owner proposes.
B. Claims 6–9 – Obviousness over Tokiwa (Ex. 1002) and Smith
(Ex.1004)
Petitioner argues that claims 6–9 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) over Tokiwa and Smith. Pet. 9–20. As explained in further detail
below, we have considered the arguments and evidence presented, and we
are persuaded that Petitioner has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that claims 6–9 are unpatentable over Tokiwa and Smith.
1. Relevant Legal Principles
A claim is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) if the differences
between the claimed subject matter and the prior art are such that the subject
matter, as a whole, would have been obvious at the time the invention was
made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter
pertains. KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406 (2007). The
question of obviousness is resolved on the basis of underlying factual
determinations including (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) any
differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art; (3) the level
of skill in the art; and, (4) where in evidence, so-called secondary
considerations, including commercial success, long-felt but unsolved needs,
failure of others, and unexpected results. Graham v. John Deere Co.,
383 U.S. 1, 17–18 (1966) (“the Graham factors”). The level of ordinary
skill in the art usually is evidenced by the references themselves. See
Okajima v. Bourdeau, 261 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001); In re GPAC
11

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
Inc., 57 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1995); In re Oelrich, 579 F.2d 86, 91
(CCPA 1978).
For an obviousness analysis, prior art references must be “considered
together with the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.”
In re Paulsen, 30 F.3d 1475, 1480 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (quoting In re Samour,
571 F.2d 559, 562 (CCPA 1978)). Moreover, “it is proper to take into
account not only specific teachings of the reference but also the inferences
which one skilled in the art would reasonably be expected to draw
therefrom.” In re Preda, 401 F.2d 825, 826 (CCPA 1968). That is because
an obviousness analysis “need not seek out precise teachings directed to the
specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for a court can take account
of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art
would employ.” KSR, 550 U.S. at 418; see also In re Translogic Tech., Inc.,
504 F.3d at 1259.
2. Summary of Tokiwa (Ex. 1002)
Tokiwa teaches a virtual machine system with a virtual machine
control program (VMCP) that manages machine resources shared among
virtual machines (VM). VMCP operates in a privileged mode and the
operating system (OS) under the VM operates in a non-privileged status or
privileged status. Ex. 1002, 2. “Direct execution of privileged commands
and interrupts on the VM means that privileged commands or interrupts
belonging to the VM are executed in nearly the same execution time as in
the actual machine, primarily by hardware.” Id. at 3.
Tokiwa also discloses an interrupt processing mechanism to prevent a
VM in standby uninterruptible state rendering the actual machine itself
uninterruptible. Ex. 1002, 4. Figure 1, reproduced below, is a logic circuit

12

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
diagram illustrating an interval timer interrupt processing mechanism for this
purpose.

Figure 1 shows that the interval timer interrupt processing mechanism may
include VM mode flag 13’. VM mode flag 13’ has a value of “1” when in
VM mode and a value of “0” when in hypervisor (HPV) mode. Ex. 1002, 3.
In VM mode, privileged commands can be executed by the VM. Id.
Figure 1 also shows interval timer interrupt detection circuit 17 that includes
interrupt cause detection circuit 170 for VM interval timer 21, interrupt
cause detection circuit 172 for VMCP interval timer 22, AND gates 171,
176, and 177, and OR gate 175 for processing the output of these interrupt
cause detection circuits according to the contents of the external interrupt

13

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
mask (E) of PSW 10, and the interval timer interrupt submask (IT) of CRO
16. Id. at 4.
Referring to Figure 1, Tokiwa describes the operation of the interrupt
processing mechanism where an interrupt is generated by VMCP interval
timer 22 while the direct execution mode of VM is running. In particular,
Tokiwa states
In this case, “1” is output from the interrupt cause detection
circuit 172. Since the direct execution VM mode flag 13’ is
“1,” the output of the OR circuit 175 is “1,” and as a result, the
output of the AND circuit 177 is “1,” and the VMCP interrupt
processing firmware 18 is started up. The firmware 18 sets the
value of the direct execution VM mode flag 13’ to “0,” and
reflects the interval timer interrupt to the VMCP prefix
indicated by the VMCP prefix register 23. That is, in this case,
when an interrupt cause is generated by the VMCP interval
timer, the VMCP always performs interrupt, regardless of the
contents of the interrupt masks (E and IT) (in this case these
are used for the running VM).
Ex. 1002, 4–5 (emphasis added). Tokiwa further discloses a second
example where an interrupt is generated by VMCP interval timer 22 while
the VM is not in direct execution mode. In the second example, VM mode
flag 13’ is “0” from the start. Id. at 5. In this mode, the interrupt is possible
only when both the E (external interrupt mask) bit of the PSW 10 and the IT
(interval timer interrupt submask) bit of CRO 16 are ‘1,’ and the output of
AND circuit 171 is ‘1.’ Id. This results in an output of “1” from OR circuit
175 and an output of “1” from AND circuit 177. Id.
3. Summary of Smith (Ex. 1004)
Smith discloses a processor capable of reducing its power
consumption by executing a WAIT or STOP instruction. In either the WAIT
or STOP state, the processor again is rendered operational or restarted by an
14

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
external reset or the presence of an interrupt signal. Ex. 1004, 5:25–40,
Figs. 2–3 (flow diagrams showing execution of WAIT and STOP
instructions). When a STOP instruction is executed, both the master clock
oscillator and internal clocks are inhibited. Id. at 5:35–37.
Figure 4, reproduced below, is a logic diagram illustrating an
apparatus for inhibiting clock signal in response to the WAIT or STOP
instructions of Figures 2 and 3 to reduce power consumption in the
processor.

As shown, Figure 4 depicts a logic diagram illustrating the WAIT
instruction, STOP instruction, a reset signal (RST), an interrupt signal (INT),
and a mask interrupt signal (MASK1). For masking, Smith further discloses
that the processor includes a five-bit condition code register in which a
“fourth bit is a mask interrupt bit and when set, disables both external and
timer interrupts. Clearing the interrupt mask bit enables both of the
interrupts.” Id. at 3:22–25.
15

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
Referring back to Figure 4, Smith indicates that in WAIT mode, the
presence of an INT signal and in the absence of a MASK1 signal will result
in a logical “0” applied to the D input of flip-flop 148. Ex. 1004, 7:29–32.
This, in turn, will result in a logical “1” applied to the reset input of WAIT
flip-flop 98, which enables clock signals C1 and C2 and address and data
strobe signals AS and DS. Id. at 7:43–48. If an interrupt signal should
occur after executing a STOP instruction, then flip-flop 148 must be reset
asynchronously because master clock oscillator 114 has been disabled. Ex.
1004, 8:48–53. Smith adds that resetting flip-flop 148
is accomplished as follows, a logical “1” on the interrupt input
is applied to a first input of NAND gate 180. Since clock signal
C2 is at a logical “0”, a logical “1” is applied to a second input
of NAND gate 180 via inverter 182. Finally, a third input of
NAND gate 182 is coupled to the output of STOP flip-flop 100
which, after execution of the STOP instruction, is at a logical
“1” level. Therefore, the output of NAND gate 180 is at a
logical “0” level. This output is inverted by inverter 184 and
applied to the R input of flip-flop 148.
Id. at 8:53–63.
4. Analysis
We have reviewed the Petition, the Patent Owner’s Response, and
Petitioner’s Reply, as well as the evidence discussed in each of those papers,
and are persuaded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 6–9
would have been obvious based on Tokiwa and Smith. Below we discuss
claim 6, which is illustrative of claims 7–9.
Our discussion of claim 6 includes the limitations recited in cancelled
claims 1, 4, and 5, which are required in dependent claim 6.

Patent 5,530,597
Cancelled claim 1 is directed to an interrupt mask disable circuit with
first logic circuitry operably coupled to receive an
interrupt request and a mask signal and to provide an interrupt
signal when the interrupt request is active and the mask signal
is disabled, and to provide a non-interrupt signal when the mask
signal is enabled regardless of whether the interrupt request is
active or inactive.
Petitioner asserts that Tokiwa’s disclosure of the interval timer interrupt
processing mechanism, depicted in Figure 1’s logic diagram, satisfies this
limitation. Pet. 13–14. Petitioner argues that Tokiwa provides an example
where an interrupt cause is generated by the VMCP interval timer while the
VM is not running in direct execution mode. Id. In that mode, “interrupt is
possible only when both the E (external interrupt mask) bit of the PSW 10
and the IT (interval timer interrupt submask) bit of the CRO 16 are ‘1.’” Id.
(citing Ex. 1002, 5).
Cancelled claim 1 further requires a
second logic circuitry operably coupled to receive a mask
activation signal and a mask override signal and to produce the
mask signal, wherein the mask signal is enabled when the mask
activation signal is active and the mask override signal is not
enabled and wherein the mask signal is disabled when the mask
override signal is active regardless of whether the mask
activation signal is enabled or disabled.
Referring, again, to Figure 1, Petitioner asserts that Tokiwa discloses a
second example where an interrupt is generated by VMCP interval timer 22
while VM is in direct execution mode (i.e., VM mode flag 13’ is “1”). Pet.
14–15. Petitioner argues that in this mode, “the VMCP interval timer . . .
always performs the interrupt, regardless of the contents of the interrupt
masks (E and IT).” Id. (quoting Ex. 1002, 5). Essentially, Petitioner asserts
that VM mode flag 13’ set to “1” discloses an override signal. Pet. 14.

Patent 5,530,597
In response, Patent Owner argues that the Petition identifies the same
circuit elements shown in Figure 1 of Tokiwa for the “first logic circuitry”
and “second logic circuitry,” and the Decision to Institute relies on different
states of the same circuit. PO Resp. 15. According to Patent Owner, the
first and second logic circuitry must “be specific, separate components,
particularly as the second logic circuitry provides the mask signal received
by the first logic circuitry.” Id.
We do not agree with Patent Owner that the “first logic circuitry” and
“second logic circuitry” must be separate components. The literal language
of claim 1 does not expressly require separate components. Nonetheless,
even assuming these limitations require separate components, the Petition
relies on the disclosure of Tokiwa’s interval timer interrupt mechanism (Ex.
1002, Fig. 1), which includes separate components AND gate 177 and OR
gate 175, for the “first logic circuitry” and the “second logic circuitry”
respectively. Pet. 13–14; Pet. Reply 5–9. Furthermore, as discussed above,
we determined that the scope of the claim term “first logic circuitry” can be
met by a single AND gate and, similarly, the claim term “second logic
circuitry” can be met by a single OR gate. See supra Claim Construction.
Patent Owner further argues that Tokiwa’s AND gate 177 does not
teach a “first logic circuitry” because AND gate 177 does not “provide a
non-interrupt signal when the mask signal is enabled regardless of whether
the interrupt request is active or inactive.” PO Resp. 16–17. Patent Owner
relies on a set of truth tables for its position. Id.
In its Reply, Petitioner contends that Patent Owner’s truth tables are
incorrect and do not take into account that Tokiwa teaches “Bits E and IT
control the output of AND gate 171, and gate 171 has a high voltage when
interrupts are allowed (i.e., not masked).” Pet. Reply 6–7 (citing Ex. 1002,
18

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
2). Petitioner further argues that gate 171 outputs a mask activation signal
that is set when gate 171 is “0” and not set when it is “1.” Pet. Reply 7.
Turning to Tokiwa, Figure 1 is reproduced below for convenience.

Figure 1 shows a logic diagram for an interval timer interrupt processing
mechanism that includes VM mode flag 13’. When VM mode flag 13’ is set
to “0,” an interrupt is possible only when both the E (external interrupt
mask) bit of the PSW 10 and the IT (interval timer interrupt submask) bit of
CRO 16 are “1,”’ and the output of AND gate 171 is “1.” Ex. 1002, 5.
Based on this disclosure, Petitioner argues that the output of AND gate 171
discloses a “mask activation signal” that is enabled when the output is “0”
and disabled when the output of AND gate 171 is “1.” Pet. Reply 7; Tr.
15:2–16:1.

19

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
Looking again to Figure 1 of Tokiwa, we note that the output of AND
gate 171 is fed into OR gate 175 along with an input from VM mode flag 13.
Furthermore, Figure 1 shows that when AND gate 171 outputs a “0” (i.e.,
enabled “mask activation signal”) and VM mode flag 13’ is set to “0” (i.e.,
HPV mode), the output of OR gate 175 will also be low or “0.” See Ex.
1002, Fig. 1. In that circumstance, Petitioner argues that a low output from
OR gate 175 teaches a “mask signal” that is enabled. Pet. Reply 8 (“OR gate
175 is a mask signal which is set when gate 175 is ‘0’ and not set when it is
‘1.’”)
Petitioner further asserts that the output of OR gate 175 (i.e., mask
signal) is input into AND gate 177, which Petitioner argues teaches a “first
logic circuitry.” Pet. Reply 8. Petitioner contends that AND gate 177
outputs an interrupt signal only if the interrupt request signal (see, e.g.,
Interrupt Hold Latch 174) and the mask signal is off or disabled. Id. at 9.
However, if the mask signal is enabled (i.e., OR gate 175 output is “0”),
“any interrupt requests are masked/blocked.” See id.
Based on the complete record before us, Petitioner’s arguments are
persuasive. We agree with Petitioner that Tokiwa teaches that when the
output of OR gate 175 is low and the “mask signal” is enabled, interrupt
requests are masked regardless of whether there is an active or inactive
interrupt request. Thus, we are persuaded that Tokiwa teaches a “first logic
circuitry” as recited in claim 1 and required in claim 6.
Next, Patent Owner argues that Tokiwa does not disclose a second
logic circuitry that enables the mask signal “when the mask activation signal
is active and the mask override signal is not enabled,” and disables the mask
signal, “when the mask override signal is active regardless of whether the
mask activation signal is enabled or disabled.” PO Resp. 17–18. Patent
20

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
Owner adds that even if VM Mode Flag 13’ is viewed as the mask override
signal, OR gate 175 does not teach a “second logic circuitry” because the
mask signal is not disabled when the mask override signal is enabled
regardless of whether the mask activation signal is enabled or disabled. Id.
at 18–19.
Based on the complete record before us, we determine Petitioner’s
arguments are persuasive. First, we are persuaded by Petitioner’s arguments
that Tokiwa teaches, “wherein the mask signal is disabled when the mask
override signal is active regardless of whether the mask activation signal is
enabled or disabled.” Specifically, Tokiwa teaches that when the VM Mode
Flag is set to “1,” “the VMCP interval timer . . . always performs the
interrupt, regardless of the contents of the interrupt masks (E and IT). Ex.
1002, 5. As discussed above, Petitioner relies on this direct execution mode
of VM Mode Flag 13’ set to “1” to teach an enabled “mask override signal.”
Pet. 14; Pet. Reply 6–7; see PO Resp. 18–19. According to Petitioner, an
output of “1” from VM Mode Flag 13’ teaches an active or enabled “mask
override signal” that is input into OR gate 175. Pet. 14; Pet. Reply 6–7.
Petitioner further argues that the output of gate 171 teaches a “mask
activation signal” that is active/enabled when “0” and disabled when set to
“1.” Pet. Reply 6–7. The output of gate 171 (i.e., mask activation signal) is
also an input into OR gate 175. Id. Given the nature of OR gate 175, when
the input from VM Mode Flag 13 is “1,” the OR gate 175 will output a “1”
regardless of the status of the signal from gate 171 (e.g., active or disabled
mask activation signal). Further, as discussed above, Petitioner argues that
the output of OR gate 175 represents the “mask signal,” which is disabled
when set to “1.” Pet. Reply 8. Thus, when VM Mode Flag 13’ is set to “1”
and the “mask override signal” is active, the output of OR gate 175 (i.e.,
21

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
mask signal) will also be set to “1” or disabled regardless of whether the
output from gate 171 (i.e., mask activation signal) is “1” or “0.” Id. at 6–8.
Second, we are persuaded by Petitioner’s arguments that Tokiwa
teaches “wherein the mask signal is enabled when the mask activation signal
is active and the mask override signal is not enabled.” Tokiwa discloses a
HPV mode for VM Mode Flag at “0” where the VM is not running in direct
execution mode and “interrupt is possible only when both the E (external
interrupt mask) bit of the PSW 10 and the IT (interval timer interrupt
submask) bit of the CRO 16 are ‘1.’” Pet. 13–14 (citing Ex. 1002, 5). As
discussed above, Petitioner argues that the output of gate 171 teaches a mask
activation signal that is active when the signal is low or “0.” Pet. Reply 6–7.
When both VM Mode Flag 13’ and the output of gate 171 input “0” into OR
gate 175, the output of OR gate 175 will be “0.” Thus, Petitioner argues that
the output of OR gate 175 of “0” teaches an enabled mask signal when the
mask activation signal (output of gate 175 is “0”), is active and the mask
override signal (output of VM Mode Flag 13 is “0”) is not enabled. Id. at 8.
We find Petitioner’s arguments persuasive.
Claim 6 also depends from cancelled claims 4 and 5. Claim 4
depends from claim 1 and recites that the “mask override signal is enabled
based on a hardware condition.” Cancelled claim 5 depends from claim 4
and requires that the interrupt mask disable circuit is incorporated within a
processor and “the hardware condition occurs when said processor is in a
particular state.”
For these limitations, Petitioner relies on the VM mode and HPV
mode for the required hardware condition and processor state. Pet. 15–17.
Additionally, Petitioner points to Tokiwa’s description of a virtual machine
system having a VMCP that manages resources (central processing units,
22

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
main memory devices, progress status words (PSWs), control registers, and
input/output devices). Id. at 17.
Additionally, with respect to all of Patent Owner’s arguments directed
to Tokiwa, Petitioner contends that collateral estoppel applies as these
arguments were not made in response to the office actions in Ex Parte
Reexamination No. 90/012781. Pet. Reply 4–5. In the interest of judicial
efficiency, we need not address this issue because in considering Patent
Owner’s arguments, we are persuaded that Petitioner has established a
preponderance of evidence that claim 6 would have been obvious over
Tokiwa and Smith.
Claim 6 depends from claim 5 and further requires the “particular
state comprises an idle mode.” For the “idle mode,” Petitioner points to
Smith’s disclosure of an apparatus for inhibiting clock signals in response to
a WAIT or STOP instruction. Pet. 17–19. At the oral hearing, Patent
Owner disputed whether Smith can disclose using an idle mode as a mask
override signal when Smith does not disclose a mask override signal. Tr.
56:6–18, 57:1–5.
Based on the complete record, we determine that Petitioner’s
arguments are persuasive. Petitioner asserts Smith teaches a “mask override
signal” because Smith discloses the ability to wake from a STOP mode
when an interrupt is received, regardless of the mask signal. Referring to
Figure 4, Petitioner asserts that the STOP mode, indicated by a logical “1”
on the STOP output of flip-flop 100, is fed into the reset path of interrupt
flip-flop 148 via NAND gate 180 and inverter 184. Pet. 21–22. The INT
signal (at “1” when indicating an interrupt) and inverted C2 clock signal
(“0” in STOP mode) are also inputs to NAND gate 180. Id. at 22. Based on
these inputs, Petitioner adds that flip-flop 148 will be reset to logical “0,”
23

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
regardless of the MASK1 signal. Id. Thus, Petitioner argues that Smith
discloses an override that allows an interrupt to cause the processor to
operate out of a low-power state, even if the interrupt is masked. Id. at 9–10.
Petitioner also argues that “[a] person of ordinary skill in the art would have
known that combining Smith’s ‘idle mode’ circuitry within Tokiwa’s
interrupt mask disable circuitry would yield predictable, expected and
beneficial results” of keeping a mask signal from preventing the processor
from waking from an interrupt when in a low power state. Id. at 10.
We are persuaded that Petitioner has established by a preponderance
of the evidence that claim 6 would have been obvious over Tokiwa and
Smith. Further, Petitioner provides detailed explanations of how each
limitation of claims 7–9 is taught or suggested by the combination of
Tokiwa and Smith. Pet. 19–20. For example, Petitioner asserts that
Tokiwa’s OR gate 175 discloses “wherein the second logic circuitry
comprises an OR gate” for claim 8. Accordingly, we are persuaded that
Petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 7–
9 would have been obvious over Tokiwa and Smith.
C. Claims 6–9 – Obviousness Over Katayose and Smith
Petitioner argues that claims 6–9 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103 over Katayose and Smith. Pet. 7, 48–60. As explained in further
detail below, we have considered the arguments and evidence presented, and
concludes that Petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence
that claims 6–9 would have been obvious over Katayose and Smith.
1. Summary of Katayose (Ex. 1003)
Katayose discloses a data processor with two different interrupt
processing modes. Ex. 1003, 1:7–10. Katayose calls the first mode a
“vector interrupt” mode and the second mode a “macroservice” mode. Id. at
24

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
3:6–7, 17–28. In the vector interrupt mode, vectors are assigned to
peripheral devices and an interrupt circuit to specify a “head address of
respective interrupt routines held in a program memory.” Id. at 1:59–60.
This allows selection of a program appropriate to the interrupt request from
a plurality of interrupt processing programs. Id. at 1:52–60. In the
macroservice mode, “if the interrupt request is generated, the execution of
the current program is interrupted and an ordinary program execution
operation of the CPU is stopped.” Id. at 3:18–22.
Referring to Figure 1, Katayose describes interrupt controller 100,
which includes interrupt request flag 102 and mode designation (MS/INT)
Flag 104. Ex. 1003, 4:19–22. When a processing request is generated from
a peripheral device and interrupt request flag 102 is set, controller 100
makes the INTRQ signal active and reads the content of the mode
designation flag 104 to make the MS/INT signal active or inactive. Id. at
4:52–57. When the MS/INT signal is low, execution unit 200 executes the
vector interrupt. Id. at 4:63–65. When the MS/INT signal is high, interrupt
processing occurs through macroservice mode. Id. at 5:11–13.
Figure 6, reproduced below, shows a logic circuit diagram for an
interrupt controller. Ex. 1003, 3:65–66.

25

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597

Figure 6’s logic circuit diagram includes interrupt flag 102, mode
designation flag 104, and interrupt processing circuit 112. Additionally,
Figure 6 includes logic gates 160A, B, and C, which respectively receive
interrupt request flags 102A, B, and C; mode designation flags 104A, B, and
C; and an EI flag signal. Ex. 1003, 14:16–21. The EI flag signal is an
interrupt enable flag that is set when an interrupt processing is allowed and
is reset when an interrupt processing is already being executed or when an
interrupt should be inhibited. Id. at 2:6–9.
When mode selection flag 104 is set (i.e., macroservice mode) and
interrupt request flag 102A is set, AND-OR logic 160A generates a high
level output regardless of the EI flag signal. Ex. 1003, 14:33–36. The
execution unit detects that the INTRQ signal is set to high and the MS/INT
signal is set to high, and executes macroservice. Id. at 14:50–52. In vector
interrupt mode, mode designation flag 104 is reset and the MS/INT signal is
low. If EI flag signal 220 is at a high level, the output of AND-OR gate
160A is high. Id. at 14:63–68. If EI flag signal 220 is low, the output of
26

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
AND-OR logic 160A is brought to a low level and the AND-OR gate
maintains its output at a low level regardless of the content of the
corresponding interrupt request flag. Id. at 15:13–17.
2. Analysis
Below we discuss claim 6, which is illustrative of claims 7–9. Again,
our discussion of claim 6 includes the limitations recited in cancelled claims
1, 4, and 5, which are required in dependent claim 6.
Cancelled claim 1 recites an interrupt mask disable circuit with
first logic circuitry operably coupled to receive an
interrupt request and a mask signal and to provide an interrupt
signal when the interrupt request is active and the mask signal
is disabled, and to provide a non-interrupt signal when the mask
signal is enabled regardless of whether the interrupt request is
active or inactive.
To meet this limitation, Petitioner asserts that Katayose discloses AND gates
160A, 160B, and 160C, which receive signals respectively from interrupt
request flags 102A, 102B, and 102C and OR gates. Pet. 48; see also id. at
52–53 (claim chart). Petitioner adds that one of the signals from the OR
gates is EI flag, which allows activation of a mask signal. Id. We are
persuaded by Petitioner’s arguments.
Cancelled claim 1 further requires a
second logic circuitry operably coupled to receive a mask
activation signal and a mask override signal and to produce the
mask signal, wherein the mask signal is enabled when the mask
activation signal is active and the mask override signal is not
enabled and wherein the mask signal is disabled when the mask
override signal is active regardless of whether the mask
activation signal is enabled or disabled.
Petitioner asserts that Katayose’s mode selection flag 104 provides a mask
override signal. Pet. 48; see also id. at 53–54 (claim chart). “When high,
27

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
the mode selection flag 104 signal causes the output of the OR gate to be
high, which will cause the interrupt to fire even if the EI flag is set to low
(i.e., the interrupt is masked).” Pet. 48. We are persuaded by Petitioner’s
argument.
In response, Patent Owner first argues that the Petition identified one
of circuit elements 102, 104, or 160 shown in Figure 6 of Katayose as the
alleged first logic circuitry and second logic circuitry, whereas the Board’s
institution decision identifies AND gates 160 as the alleged first logic
circuitry and mode selection flag 104 as the alleged second logic circuitry.
PO Resp. 19–21. For clarity of the record, Patent Owner’s characterization
of the Decision to Institute is incorrect. The Decision to Institute the instant
inter partes review was based on the evidence and arguments presented in
the Petition. Dec. 2. The Decision to Institute generally refers to the
evidence and arguments presented in the Petition (including elements 104
and 160 of Katayose), and does not depart from Petitioner’s arguments
presented in the Petition on this point. Dec. 16–17 (citing Pet. 48, 52–54).
Next, Patent Owner argues that Katayose does not teach a first logic
circuitry “to provide an interrupt signal when the interrupt request is active
and the mask signal is disabled, and to provide a non-interrupt signal when
the mask signal is enabled regardless of whether the interrupt request is
active or inactive.” PO Resp. 20–21. Patent Owner further relies on a set of
truth tables to argue that the circuit shown in Figure 6 of Tokiwa does not
disclose the recited logical relationship. Id. Patent Owner also argues that
Petitioner has not identified elements disclosed in Katayose that correspond
to the second logic circuitry. Id. at 23.
Petitioner argues that the circuit shown in Figure 6 includes three
AND-OR logics 160A/B/C which respectively receive the interrupt request
28

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
flags 102A/B/C, and the mode designation flags 104A/B/C, and which also
commonly receive the EI flag signal. Pet. 52 (citing Ex. 1003, 14:10–26).
Petitioner further argues that the EI flag signal represents a mask activation
signal. Pet. 48; Pet. Reply 10. Petitioner adds that “[w]hen activated, the
mask signal causes EI flag to generate a low level output, and the interrupt
will not be activated because the signal from the OR gate into AND gate
160A, for example, would be low.” Id. Petitioner asserts that the mask
override signal is represented by flip-flop 104A/B/C. Id. (citing Ex. 1003,
1:65–2:9, 14:30–36). Petitioner further asserts that EI flag 220 and mode
selection flag 104 signals are inputs of the OR gates of 160A/B/C, whose
outputs represent the mask signal as an input to the AND gates of 160A/B/C.
Pet. 48; Pet. Reply 10. Petitioner also argues the interrupt request is
represented by flip-flop 102A/B/C, and it is also an input to the AND gates.
Id.
Based on the complete record, Petitioner’s arguments are persuasive.
Looking at the gates of 160A, the AND gate receives a processing request
from interrupt flag 102A when interrupt flag 102A is set. Ex. 1003, 4:52–
57. The AND gate also receives the input from interrupt flag 102A and the
output from the OR gate of 160A. Id. at Fig. 6. When interrupt flag 102A is
set (i.e., interrupt request signal set) and the output of OR gate 160A is high
(i.e., mask signal disabled), the output of the AND will be high, allowing
interrupts. Id. at 14:27–49, 6:26–40, Fig. 6. However, when the output of
the OR gate is low (i.e., mask signal is enabled), the output of the AND gate
will also be low regardless of whether the interrupt request from interrupt
flag is set or not. Id. at Fig. 6.
Additionally, OR gate of 160A receives inputs from EI flag 220 and
mode selection flag 104. Petitioner argues that EI flag 220 provides a mask
29

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
activation signal and mode selection flag 104 provides a mask override
signal. Pet. 48; Pet. Reply 10. Katayose teaches that when the mode
selection flag 104 is set, the system processes interrupts in “macroservice
mode.” Ex. 1003, 4:52–57, 5:11–13. Thus, in this circumstance, OR gate of
160A will have a high output, disabled mask signal, regardless of the input
from EI flag 220. The output of the OR gate will be low (i.e., mask signal
enabled) when the signals from EI flag 220 and mode selection flag 104 are
both low.
Cancelled claim 4 depends from claim 1 and recites that the “mask
override signal is enabled based on a hardware condition.” Cancelled
claim 5 depends from claim 4 and requires that the interrupt mask disable
circuit is incorporated within a processor and “the hardware condition occurs
when said processor is in a particular state.”
For these limitations, Petitioner asserts that Katayose discloses
controller 100, which includes interrupt request flag 102 and mode
designation flag 104. Pet. 55–56. Petitioner adds that Katayose describes a
“third case” where the mode designation flag 104 is set for the macroservice
mode and both the INTRQ and MS/INT signal are rendered active to a high
level regardless of the content of EI flag 218. Id. at 54. We understand
Petitioner’s position to be that the macroservice mode meets the limitations
of a hardware condition and processor state recited in cancelled claims 4 and
5. We are persuaded by Petitioner’s arguments.
Claim 6 depends from claim 5 and further requires the “particular
state comprises an idle mode.” For the “idle mode,” Petitioner points to
Smith’s disclosure of an apparatus for inhibiting clock signals in response to
a WAIT or STOP instruction. Pet. 58. Petitioner further asserts that Smith
discloses receiving an INT signal after executing a STOP instruction,
30

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
whereby flip-flop 148 is reset regardless of the state of the MASK1 signal.
Id. at 22, 58–59. Petitioner asserts several reasons why one of ordinary skill
in the art would have combined the alleged teachings in Katayose and Smith.
Id. at 50–51. These reasons include that combining the different interrupt
modes described in Katayose with the idle mode disclosed in Smith would
reduce power consumption and “‘provide an apparatus for disabling clock
signals in an intelligent manner until further processor operations become
necessary.’” Id. at 50 (citing Ex. 1004, 2:2–15).
Accordingly, we are persuaded that Petitioner has established by a
preponderance of the evidence that claim 6 would have been obvious over
Katayose and Smith. Further, Petitioner provides detailed explanations of
how each limitation of claims 7–9 is taught or suggested by the combination
of Katayose and Smith, which we find persuasive. Pet. 59–60. Thus, we are
persuaded that Petitioner also has demonstrated by a preponderance of the
evidence that claims 7–9 would have been obvious over Katayose and
Smith.
D. Claims 6 and 7 – Anticipation by Smith (Ex. 1004)
Petitioner argues that claims 6 and 7 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b) over Smith. Pet. 20–29. Below, we discuss claim 6, which is
illustrative of claims 7–9.
Based on the complete record, we agree with Patent Owner and
Petitioner that it is not clear from the Petition which elements in Smith are
relied upon by the Petitioner for this challenge. PO Resp. 8–13; Tr. 44:17–
20, 45:10–22 (Petitioner states “we do recognize . . . that there are some
concerns with the 15 specific teachings of Smith, whether it anticipates”).
For example, referring to Figure 4 of Smith, Petitioner argues that Smith
teaches an “INT (interrupt) signal and a MASK1 signal are inputs to NAND
31

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
gate 154, the output of which feeds to the D input of the interrupt flip-flop
148.” Pet. 21. The Petition further notes that “mask interrupt signal
(MASK[1]) is applied to inverter 156 the output of which is coupled to a
second input of NAND gate 154.” Pet. 24. Petitioner also argues that Smith
discloses overriding the mask signal via the output of STOP flip-flop 100.
Id. at 21. Petitioner asserts
The STOP mode is indicated by a logical “1” on the STOP
output of flip-flop 100, which is fed into the reset path of the
interrupt flip-flop 148. The inputs to NAND gate 180, which
controls the reset of the interrupt flip-flop 148) are the STOP
signal, the INT signal, and an inverted version of clock signal
C2 (which Smith describes as always “0” while in STOP
mode). Accordingly, when the device is in STOP mode (the
STOP signal is “1”) and an interrupt is received (the INT signal
is “1”), the interrupt flip-flop 148 will be reset to logical “0”,
indicating an interrupt, regardless of the state of the MASK1
signal.
Id. at 21–22 (citing Ex. 1002, 8:48–65).
Based on this discussion in the Petition, it is unclear how Smith
discloses a mask signal. For example, if Petitioner relies on the MASK1
signal to teach a mask signal, Petitioner has not demonstrated by a
preponderance of the evidence that Smith teaches a second logic circuitry
that produces the MASK1 signal. Furthermore, to the extent that the
Petition argues that other components disclosed in Smith teach the mask
signal, we decline to speculate on what aspects of Smith satisfy this
limitation.
Accordingly, for claims 6–9, we determine that Petitioner has not
shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that these claims are anticipated
by Smith.

III. MOTION TO EXCLUDE
A motion to exclude is required to preserve an objection to the
admissibility of evidence. 37 C.F.R. § 42.64(c). Patent Owner seeks to
exclude the following evidence: (1) Petitioner’s citations to the ’597 patent
on the basis that these improperly advance claim construction positions
(Mot. Excl. 1–3); (2) Exhibits 1012 (Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate for
the ’597 patent) and 1013 (Notice of Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination
Certificate for the ’597 patent) on the basis that these are not relevant and
constitute a new ground of unpatentability (id. at 4–6); and (3) Petitioner’s
arguments presented on pages 5–15 of Petitioner’s Reply directed to truth
tables and “complementary relationships” on the basis these arguments are
speculative and not supported by evidence in the record (id. at 6–15).
A motion to exclude is neither a substantive sur-reply, nor a proper
vehicle for arguing whether a reply or supporting evidence is of appropriate
scope. Zynga Inc. v. Personalized Media Commc’ns, LLC, IPR2013-00162,
slip op. at 3 (PTAB Aug. 28, 2013) (Paper 16); Berk-Tek LLC v. Belden
Tech., Inc., IPR2013-00057, slip op. at 3 (PTAB Oct. 31, 2013) (Paper 39).
In this case, the Patent Owner Response raised several substantive
issues that were not raised in the Petition. These include the proper
construction of the “first logic circuitry” and “second logic circuitry” (PO’s
Resp. 14–16) and whether Tokiwa teaches these limitations (id. at 14–19),
both of which we have discussed extensively.
Petitioner was entitled to rebut Patent Owner’s arguments concerning
the construction of the first and second logic circuitry limitations. Pet.
Reply 2–3. A petitioner’s reply to a patent owner response may address
only issues raised in the corresponding opposition. Office Patent Trial
Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg. 48,756, 48,767 (Aug. 14, 2012). Although the
33

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
Patent Owner contends there is no dispute regarding the claim terms “first
logic circuitry” and “second logic circuitry,” Patent Owner attempts to
directly address the substance of the dispute in its Motion to Exclude. More
specifically, Patent Owner attempts to bolster its argument that the claim
language “first logic circuitry” excludes an AND gate alone and “second
logic circuitry” excludes an OR gate alone. Mot. Excl. 2; PO Resp. 14–16.
This is an improper use of a motion to exclude, which does not afford for an
opportunity for Patent Owner to present arguments that belong in a surreply. Additionally, we note that the parties were given an opportunity to
clarify respective claim construction issues at the oral hearing. Tr. 37:18–
42:1, 46:5–48:7.
Petitioner was also entitled to rebut Patent Owner’s arguments
concerning the objective criteria of non-obviousness. Pet. Reply 5–13
(addressing the combination of Tokiwa and Smith and Katayose and Smith).
Patent Owner presented several arguments based on truth tables that Patent
Owner asserted represented the logical relationships disclosed in Tokiwa and
Katayose. PO Resp. 16–24. In response to Patent Owner’s arguments based
on its truth tables, Petitioner’s Reply contained alternative truth tables based
on Petitioner’s reading of the references. Pet. Reply 7–13; Tr. 24:1–25:17.
In challenging Patent Owner’s truth tables, Petitioner relies on a
complementary relationship theory to support its own truth tables. Pet.
Reply 7–13; Tr. 13:24–16:1. Patent Owner contends that this theory is not
supported by any evidence in the record. Even assuming Patent Owner is
correct, a motion to exclude addresses the admissibility of evidence, and not
how much weight to give an argument.
Finally, we are not persuaded that Petitioner’s reliance on Exhibits
1012 and 1013 for a collateral estoppel theory constitutes a new ground of
34

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
unpatentability. Petitioner was entitled to rebut Patent Owner’s nonobviousness arguments by relying on rebuttal evidence challenging
arguments raised in the Patent Owner’s Response. Moreover, we note that
we considered all of Patent Owner’s arguments concerning Tokiwa without
determining whether collateral estoppel applies. Upon review of the
complete record, we determine, as discussed above, that Petitioner has
demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Tokiwa and Smith
render claims 6–9 of the ’597 patent unpatentable. Thus, at the very least,
Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude Exhibits 1012, and 1013 should be
denied as moot.
In consideration of the above, we deny Patent Owner’s Motion to
Exclude in its entirety.
IV.

CONCLUSION

Petitioner has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims
6–9 of the ’597 patent are unpatentable.
IV. ORDER
In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby:
ORDERED that claims 6–9 of the ’597 patent have been shown, by a
preponderance of the evidence, to be unpatentable over Tokiwa and Smith;
FURTHER ORDERED that claims 6–9 of the ’597 patent have been
shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be unpatentable over
Katayose and Smith;
FURTHER ORDERED that claims 6–9 of the ’597 patent have not
been shown by a preponderance of the evidence to be unpatentable as
anticipated by Smith;
FURTHER ORDERED that Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude is
DENIED; and
35

IPR2014-00564
Patent 5,530,597
FURTHER ORDERED that because this is a final written decision of
the Board under 35 U.S.C. § 318(a), parties to the proceeding seeking
judicial review of the decision must comply with the notice and service
requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
