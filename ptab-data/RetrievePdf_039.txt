We issue this Final Written Decision pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a)
and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73. For the reasons that follow, Petitioner has shown by
a preponderance of the evidence that claims 1, 4–6, 10, and 13–20 of the

BACKGROUND
The ’870 patent (Ex. 1001)

The ’870 patent issued January 27, 1998, from U.S. Application No.
08/508,462, filed July 31, 1995. Ex. 1001. The ’870 patent, titled “Packet
Header Generation and Detection Circuitry,” describes a device for
receiving and transmitting direct sequence spread spectrum (“DSSS”)
signals using a single integrated device for converting and demodulating an
RF signal into a serial data signal. Id. at Abstract. In particular, according
to the ’870 patent, “[c]ritical timing relationships during the acquisition and
demodulation of the received signal are satisfied by the use of an integrated
circuit specially designed to perform all operations needed to convert the
physical signal to a[] media access circuit level data signal.” Id.
According to the ’870 patent, standards for the communication of
signals in a wireless Local Area Network (“LAN”) system typically utilize a
message format consisting of a fixed length preamble having fields for
power ramping, synchronization, a signal field, a descrambling seed, and a
unique word identifier, followed by the data, and then a Cyclical
Redundancy Check (“CRC”) field. Id. at 4:41–49. The preamble may be
modulated onto the carrier signal using digital Binary Phase Shift Keyed
3

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
(“BPSK”) modulation, and the data and CRC signals may be modulated
using either BPSK or Quaternary Phase Shift Keyed (“QPSK”) modulation.
Id. at 4:49–56. As explained by Patent Owner, the ’870 patent “is directed
to circuitry for demodulating a header portion of a signal that has been
BPSK modulated and for demodulating a data portion of the signal that has
been QPSK modulated.” PO Resp. 6.
Figure 2 of the ’870 patent is reproduced below.

Figure 2 illustrates a functional block diagram of a communications
transceiver, including antennae 20, 22 and selector switch 28 that connects
antenna coupler 26 to either a transmit circuit or a receive circuit. Ex. 1001,
4:59–66. In the receive circuit, the incoming signal is first amplified by
RF/IF converter 30, and then further amplified by quadrature Intermediate
Frequency (“IF”) modulator/demodulator 42. The amplified signal may be
4

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
split into I and Q (in-phase (real) and quadrature (imaginary)) components.
Id. at 5:5–15. The I and Q component signals may be provided to a
baseband processor that converts the analog signals to digital signals at A/D
converters 54, 56, and then despreads the spread spectrum signal through
despreader 58. Id. at 5:24–28. The despread signal may be demodulated by
Differential Phase Shift Keyed (“DPSK”) demodulator 60 to provide a
digital data signal to be passed to an application system through interface
circuit 62. Data to be transmitted may follow a similar return path, passing
through modulator 64, data spreader 66, and modulator/demodulator 42;
after which it is upconverted to RF by RF/IF converter 30 and then provided
to one of the antennae, as selected by switch 24.
Figure 3 of the ’870 patent is reproduced below.

5

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
Figure 3 illustrates a functional block diagram of a baseband
processor for use in a transceiver in accordance with the claimed invention.
Id. at 4:36–37, 6:50–51. The output signal from correlators 84, 86 is
converted from I and Q form to polar form by Cartesian-to-polar converter
88 to reduce the need for duplicate hardware for independent I and Q
channels. Id. at 7:23–28. The polar signal is provided to PSK demodulator
100, followed by differential decoder 102 and data descrambler 104. Id. at
8:3–6. The PSK demodulator can demodulate both BPSK and QPSK
signaling, allowing the preamble of a received signal to be in BPSK and the
data in either BPSK or QPSK. Id. at 8:6–10. Descrambled data may be
provided to processor interface 114, which may control the passage of the
data to another device such as a media access control (“MAC”) circuit.
According to the ’870 patent, providing the entire baseband processor onto a
single chip benefits accurate and timely demodulation of received signals
and the extraction of data. Id. at 8:67–9:3.
The baseband processor may be used to transfer packetized, serial
data received in a physical layer to a MAC layer. Id. at 9:10–14. Header
information imbedded in the packetized data is used to control the physical
layer. Id. at 9:10–14. The header information may include a signal field to
specify the signaling type used to modulate the data as either DPSK or
QPSK, as well as a unique word. Id. at 9:14–18. The baseband processor
may receive header information in BPSK and in QPSK. Id. at 9:18–20.
According to the ’870 patent, “the timing of switching the receiver from one
signal[]ing format to another is time critical.” Id. at 9:20–22. In accordance

6

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
with the ’870 patent, all of the header detection and similar physical layer
tasks may be imbedded into a single device. Id. at 9:22–23.
Further, during demodulation of the header, header data is monitored
and used both to identify the type of signaling to be used for the data and to
select between plural antennae. Id. at 9:45–48. In receiving the header, the
baseband processor converts the serial data into a parallel word that is
compared to preselected values for the unique word and signaling fields. Id.
at 9:50–53. When the unique word is found, a field counter detects header
fields, including the signaling field, which, when detected, is “used to switch
the receiver modulator/demodulator between BPSK and QPSK at the correct
time with respect to the data portion of the packet.” Id. at 9:56–63.
In describing the ’870 patent, Patent Owner draws attention to certain
features it identifies as technological advances, including the integration of
multiple components on a single device, an antenna diversity scheme, and a
digital demodulator for both BPSK and QPSK demodulation. PO Resp. 6–9.
B.

II. ANALYSIS
A.

Claim Construction

The Board interprets claims of an unexpired patent using the broadest
reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which
they appear. 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b); In re Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC, 793
F.3d 1268, 1277–79 (Fed. Cir. 2015), (Fed. Cir. 2015) (“We conclude that
Congress implicitly approved the broadest reasonable interpretation standard
in enacting the AIA.”), reh’g en banc denied, 793 F.3d 1297 (Fed. Cir.
2015), petition for cert. filed, No. 15-446 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2015). Consistent
8

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
with the broadest reasonable construction, claim terms are presumed to have
their ordinary and customary meaning, as understood by a person of
ordinary skill in the art, in the context of the entire patent disclosure. In re
Translogic Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
In the Decision to Institute we made a number of initial claim
construction determinations that Patent Owner does not contest in its
Response and that Petitioner does not address in its Reply. We determined
the broadest reasonable construction of “timer for transitioning between the
BPSK demodulation and the QPSK demodulation,” consistent with its usage
in the Specification of the ’870 patent, is “a time measurement device that
determines the time for transitioning between the BPSK demodulation and
the QPSK demodulation.” Inst. Dec. 11. We also determined that a “single
monolithic device” includes one integrated circuit. Id.
Claims 1 and 2 include several terms recited as “means” for
performing identified functions, which are presumptively construed under
35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 6.4 With respect to the construction of the following
limitations, in the Institution Decision we agreed with the parties in their
identification of the appropriate corresponding structure. Inst. Dec. 12–13.

Section 4(c) of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (“AIA”) redesignated 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 6, as 35 U.S.C. § 112(f). Pub. L. No. 112–29,
125 Stat. 284, 296 (2011). Because the ’870 patent has a filing date before
September 16, 2012 (effective date of § 4(c)), we refer to the pre-AIA
version of § 112.

Petitioner’s additional inclusion of RF/IF converter 30 as corresponding
structure for receiving an analog signal is not supported by the ’870 patent
specification, which explains RF/IF converter 30 amplifies the incoming
signal.

Although Petitioner refers to demodulator 60, Petitioner’s declarant,
Prof. Zhi Ding, like Patent Owner, more specifically identifies the PSK
Demodulator. See Ex. 1003 ¶ 43.

Obviousness Over Fischer and Nakamura

Petitioner asserts that claims 1, 2, 4–6, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16–20 are
unpatentable as obvious over Fischer and Nakamura. Pet. 13–31.

Summary of Fischer

Fischer is titled “Medium Access Control Protocol for Wireless
Network.” Fischer “relates to a technique and protocol for connecting
multiple distinct computer resources by radio frequency (RF) or other
wireless communications to establish a single logical network of the
resources to permit communication between the distinct resources similar to
that of a local area network (LAN).” Ex. 1004, 1:16–21. More particularly,
Fischer relates to a medium access control (“MAC”) technique or protocol
for selectively activating and deactivating transmitters and receivers to save
electrical power consumed while still permitting LAN-like functionality. Id.
at 1:21–27.

Figure 4 of Fischer is reproduced below.

Fischer Figure 4 is a block diagram of communicator 60. Id. at 7:19.
“Each communicator 60 has a network interface 36, a microcontroller 90, a
read only memory (ROM) 92, a random access memory (RAM) 94, and a
RF modem 96, all of which are interconnected by a bus 98.” Id. at 14:46–
50. “RF signals are transmitted to and received by the communicators at the
RF modem 96.” Id. at 15:4–5. “The transmitting and receiving RF modems
96 perform all of the necessary spreading, modulation, demodulation, and
despreading functions to successfully transfer the frames between
communicators.” Id. at 15:35–39.

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
Figure 5 of Fischer is reproduced below.

Fischer Figure 5 is a block diagram of RF modem 96, a component of
communicator 60 as shown in Fischer Figure 4. RF signals are transmitted
from or received by antennas 100 and 102. When selection switch 106 is in
the received position, signals pass through filter 104, are applied to noise
amplifier 108, supplied to filter 110, applied to radio device 112, and then
applied to coherent demodulator 114. Radio device 112 performs both a
radio receiving function and an amplifying function. Coherent demodulator
114 extracts the base band data from the RF carrier signal which has been
BPSK or QPSK7 modulated, and also functions as a coherent correlator for
the spread spectrum sequence which modulates the data. Id. at 16:21–47.
7

Fischer and Nakamura refer to “QPSK” as “quadrature phase-shift keying,”
which we understand to be the same as Quarternary Phase Shift Keyed
modulation. See Ex. 1001, 4:52–53.

Summary of Nakamura

Nakamura, titled “Carrier Recovery Phase-Locked Loop,” relates to a
carrier recovery phase-locked loop for recovering a carrier from a timedivided received wave, and more particularly to a carrier recovery phaselocked loop (PLL) suitable for recovering a carrier from a digitized QPSK
modulated wave. Ex. 1005, 1:6–12. Nakamura notes that a preamble
received in the form of a BPSK modulated wave is superior to the QPSK
modulated wave in point of noise-proof capability. Id. at 2:26–30. As a
result, Nakamura uses a PLL circuit for carrier recovery comprising a first
means, responsive to a received burst signal, for preparing a phase
comparator’s characteristic adapted for the BPSK modulated wave, second
means for preparing a phase comparator’s characteristic adapted for the
QPSK modulated wave, and switching means for selectively supplying
output signals from the first and second means to the PLL circuit. Id. at
2:31–41.

Patent 5,712,870
Figure 4 of Nakamura is reproduced below.

Nakamura Figure 4 is a circuit diagram illustrating a carrier recovery phaselocked loop. Ex. 1005, 3:4–5. Digital type binary/quadrature phase
comparator characteristic switching circuit 54 may demodulate a header
portion of a digital signal using BPSK and a data portion using QPSK. Id. at
6:41–53. “When the output signal of the band-pass filter 31 exceeds a
predetermined level, the comparator 32 sends an output signal to a timer 34,
thereby informing the timer 34 of the arrival of the received signal.” Id. at
6:21–25. Timer 34 permits switch 14 to transfer from terminal A to terminal
B either after the lapse of a predetermined time corresponding to the
duration of the preamble following the reception of the output signal from
the comparator 32 or by detecting the repetitive duration of the preamble.
Id. at 6:31–40.

Claims 1, 10, and 17

Petitioner argues that each of independent claims 1, 10, and 17 is
unpatentable as obvious over Fischer and Nakamura. Pet. 15–26.
Notwithstanding the fact that claim 1 recites “means” for performing
identified functions, whereas claims 10 and 17 do not recite “means”
limitations, the three claims recite similar subject matter, and Petitioner
advances the same reasoning in its analysis of all three claims. Id. Patent
Owner’s Response also generally addresses claims 1, 10, and 17 collectively
in a similar manner. PO Resp. 10–31. Although our analysis below
primarily focuses on claim 1, our determinations with respect to claim 1
apply for the same reasons to the identified similar limitations of claims 10
and 17.
a. Claim 1 – “A circuit for detecting a message header in a signal
which has been transmitted using direct sequence spread spectrum
modulation, comprising a single device having”
Claim 10 – “In a communication system capable of receiving RF
direct sequence spread spectrum signals, said system having a message
header detection circuit comprising a single device having”
Claim 17 – “A direct sequence spread spectrum receiver, said
receiver having a physical layer associated with the receiving of RF
signals and a media access control (MAC) layer associated with the
using of data within said RF signals, said physical layer comprising a
single device”
Petitioner has shown that Fischer RF modem 96 is a circuit
comprising a single device, which, in its capacity as a receiver, can detect a
message header in a signal that has been transmitted using DSSS, as recited
in claim 1 of the ’870 patent. See Pet. 15–17 (citing Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 34–36, 39,
41). Fischer RF modem 96 transmits and receives signals that employ DSSS
16

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
modulation and demodulation, and Fischer’s communicator 60 includes
microcontroller 90 that provides a MAC layer, which implements a MAC
protocol. Ex. 1004, 14:46–61, Fig. 6. Patent Owner does not dispute
Petitioner’s assertion that Fischer teaches each of these limitations.
b. Claim 1 – “means for receiving an analog signal having modulated
thereon in a spread spectrum format a message having a header portion
and a data portion”
Claims 10 and 17 – “an analog receiver for receiving a spread
spectrum modulated signal having a header portion and a data portion”
Petitioner has shown that antennae 20, 22 of the ’870 patent
correspond to the claimed “means for receiving.” Pet. 17–18. As is
apparent from Fischer Figure 5, RF modem 96 preferably has at least two
antennas 100 and 102. Ex. 1004, 15:5–6. We find persuasive Petitioner’s
contention that Fischer RF modem 96 meets the “means for receiving”
element recited in claim 1, including Petitioner’s explanation of how radio
device 112 within RF modem 96 is equivalent to structure identified in the
’870 patent specification as performing the claimed “receiving” function.
See Pet. 17–18 (citing Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 35, 37, 43). Patent Owner does not
dispute Petitioner’s assertion that Fischer teaches each of these limitations.
c. Claim 1 – “means for converting said analog signal into a digital
signal”
Claims 10 and 17 – “an analog-to-digital converter operable on said
modulated signal”
Petitioner has shown that analog-to-digital (A/D) converters 54, 56 of
the ’870 patent correspond to the claimed “means for converting.” Pet. 18.
Petitioner also has shown that Fischer RF modem 96 includes coherent
demodulator 114, which constitutes a means for converting an analog signal
17

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
(“having modulated thereon in a spread spectrum format a message having a
header portion and a data portion”) into a digital signal, as claimed. See Pet.
19; Reply 2–4; Ex. 1003 ¶ 38; Ex. 1013 ¶¶ 1–5. Fischer states that coherent
demodulator 114 “extracts the base band data from the RF carrier signal
which has been BPSK or QPSK modulated,” and “also functions as a
coherent correlator for the spread spectrum sequence which modulates the
data.” Ex. 1004, 16:43–47.
We do not find persuasive Patent Owner’s argument that nothing in
Fischer teaches that the comparators in coherent demodulator 114 convert a
“‘spread spectrum modulated’ analog signal into a digital signal,” as
opposed to “other analog signals.” See PO Resp. 13. To the contrary,
Fischer states that “[t]he communicators preferably transmit and receive
messages over a wireless physical layer provided by a direct-sequence,
spread spectrum (DSSS) radio data link.” Ex. 1004, 14:24–27. Fischer
further explains that “[s]ince many of the signals in the coherent
demodulator 114 are analog signals, the coherent demodulator 114 includes
comparators to establish digital waveforms.” Ex. 1004, 16:58–60. As
shown in Figure 5 of Fischer, the coherent demodulator 114 is followed by
spread spectrum correlator and decoder 130, which “handles the
demodulator 114 output to regenerate the unspread data.” Ex. 1004, 17:58–
60. Thus, we agree with Petitioner, as supported by Prof. Ding, that a person
of ordinary skill in the art “would have understood Fischer to describe that
the demodulator 114 converts the analog DSSS modulated messages
received by antennas 100/102 to digital signals and outputs these digital

18

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
DSSS modulated messages in I and Q format to spread spectrum correlator
and decoder 130.” Reply 3–4; Ex. 1013 ¶ 5.
d. Claim 1 – “means for demodulating the header of the digital signal
using digital binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) demodulation and for
demodulating the data portion of the same message using quarter[n]ary
phase shift keyed demodulation (QPSK)”
Claims 10 and 17 – “a digital demodulator for binary phase shift
keyed (BPSK) demodulation of said header portion and qua[r]ternary
phase shift keyed (QPSK) demodulation of said data portion”
Petitioner has shown that PSK demodulator 100 of the ’870 patent
corresponds to the claimed “means for demodulating.” Pet. 19. Although
Fischer’s RF modem 96 provides a demodulator that may be configured for
using either BPSK or QPSK, Petitioner concedes that “Fischer does not
disclose the use of BPSK and QPSK in a single implementation, nor does
Fischer disclose the application of one to the header portion and the other to
the data portion.” Pet. 13–14.
Petitioner instead relies upon Nakamura, in combination with Fischer,
as teaching the claimed means for demodulating the header using BPSK and
the data portion using QPSK. For the reasons that follow, we are persuaded
by this argument. There is no dispute that Fischer’s coherent demodulator
114 is a means for demodulating a digital signal using BPSK or QPSK
demodulation. See PO Resp. 15 (“The coherent demodulator 114 extracts
the base band data from the RF carrier signal which has been BPSK or
QPSK modulated.” (quoting Ex. 1004, 16:43–45)). We do not find
persuasive Patent Owner’s argument that Fischer’s specific implementation
supports only BPSK or QPSK modulation. PO Resp. 14–16. Petitioner has
shown persuasively that Fischer’s RF modem 96 is not limited to exclusive
19

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
support of only BPSK or only QPSK modulation; to the contrary, modem 96
may be configured to select either form of modulation. Reply 10–11; Ex.
1013 ¶ 10. Thus, while Fischer does not disclose the use of BPSK and
QPSK in a single implementation, as Petitioner concedes, Petitioner has
demonstrated that Fischer has the capability of using either. See Reply 10–
11; Ex. 1004, 17:35–43; Ex. 1013 ¶ 10.
Moreover, Patent Owner’s extensive argument that Fischer, alone,
does not disclose the claimed means for demodulating is not persuasive
because Petitioner does not rely only on Fischer as disclosing the means for
demodulating. In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425 (CCPA 1981) (test for
obviousness is what the combined teachings of the prior art would have
suggested to the hypothetical person of ordinary skill). See PO Resp.14–16.
As noted supra, Petitioner relies on Nakamura in combination with Fischer.
Similarly, we find not persuasive Patent Owner’s argument that Nakamura
fails to disclose demodulation, as Petitioner does not rely only on Nakamura
as teaching demodulation. See PO Resp. 17–23.
There is no dispute that Nakamura teaches the use of a switch to
transition from BPSK during a preamble portion of a signal to QPSK during
the data portion of the signal, albeit for phase comparison and not
demodulation. PO Resp. 18–19. As Petitioner has demonstrated that
Fischer and Nakamura, together, teach the elements necessary to constitute
means for demodulating, as claimed, the issue that remains, which is
addressed below, is whether Petitioner has articulated a sufficient rationale
for the asserted combination.

Patent 5,712,870
e. Claim 1 – “means contained on said single device for timing a
transition from BPSK modulation to QPSK modulation”
Claims 10 and 17 – “a timer for transitioning between the BPSK
demodulation and the QPSK demodulation”
Petitioner has shown that “for timing a transition from BPSK
modulation to QPSK modulation,” the ’870 patent discloses timer 34 and
processor interface 114, “which determines whether a received signal
includes a bit pattern (e.g., a unique word), and which ‘is used to switch the
receiver modulator/demodulator between BPSK and QPSK’ when the bit
pattern is deemed present, thereby controlling the timing of the transition.”
Ex. 1003 ¶ 17, quoting Ex. 1001, 9:61–63. Patent Owner concedes that
Nakamura teaches the use of a switch transfer mechanism, including timer
34, to transition from BPSK to QPSK, again, in the context of phase
comparison, not demodulation. PO Resp. 19–20. Patent Owner’s extensive
analysis of how the carrier recovery PLL of Nakamura could be incorporated
into a receiver processing chain, proffered to show that “Nakamura does not
teach using the carrier recovery PLL circuit for BPSK and QPSK digital
demodulation” (id. at 22), is unpersuasive. PO Resp. 19–23. “The test for
obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be
bodily incorporated into the structure of the primary reference.” Keller, 642
F.2d at 425.
Patent Owner also argues that Petitioner improperly combines
alternative embodiments of Nakamura’s switch transfer mechanism, the first
of which is purportedly based on detecting the arrival of the non-modulated
duration portion of the preamble, while the second is based on detecting the
repetitive duration of the preamble. PO Resp. 23; Ex. 2006 ¶ 62. We
21

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
disagree. Nakamura does not describe these as “alternative embodiments,”
but instead presents them as variations in implementation details of the same
embodiment:
Since the duration of the preamble added as the heading
to the transmission level is predetermined, the timer 34 permits
the switch 14 to transfer from terminal A to terminal B after the
lapse of predetermined time following the reception of the
output signal from the comparator 32.
The manner of transferring the switch 14 is not limited to
the above but for example, the switch 14 may be transferred by
detecting the repetitive duration of the preamble.
Ex. 1005, 6:31–40; see also 4:1–4, 6:41–47 (distinguishing a first
“embodiment” of the invention because it is “adapted for handling analog
signals” from a “second embodiment” for “handling digital signals,” not
because of the switch transfer mechanism).
Patent Owner argues that Nakamura does not suggest that timer 34 is
used when transfer is prompted by the detection of the repetitive duration.
PO Resp. 27. We find insufficient support for Patent Owner’s assertion that
Nakamura’s use of a repetitive duration to trigger switch 14 obviates the
need for a timer. See Ex. 2006 ¶ 63. We first find that claims 10 and 17
only require “a timer for transitioning between the BPSK demodulation and
the QPSK demodulation,” rendering Patent Owner’s arguments over how
the timer is prompted beyond the scope of claims 10 and 17. We further
understand Nakamura to teach the use of timer 34 to permit switch 14 to
transfer from BPSK modulation (terminal A) to QPSK modulation (terminal
B) after the lapse of a predetermined time. See Ex. 1003 ¶ 27. In one
example, that timer is triggered when the output signal of band-pass filter 31
22

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
exceeds a predetermined threshold. Ex. 1005, 6:22–23. In another example,
Nakamura indicates that “switch 14 may be transferred by detecting the
repetitive duration of the preamble.” Id. at 6:37–40. In either example, we
are persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that Nakamura suggests
using a timer as disclosed in both Figures 1 and 4.
We also find not persuasive Patent Owner’s argument that
Nakamura’s switch transfer mechanism is “too imprecise” to be suitable for
timing a transition between BPSK demodulation and QPSK demodulation
because wireless channel conditions “may result in a short delay” and
excessive noise or interference in the wireless channel “may cause an
advance in detecting the preamble.” PO Resp. 31–35. To the contrary,
Petitioner has shown that Nakamura’s switch transfer mechanism is suitable
for transitioning between BPSK demodulation and QPSK demodulation, and
has identified various components from the combination with Fischer that
would lead one of ordinary skill in the art to have expected the timing
mechanism to have sufficient precision “under most, if not all, channel
conditions.” Ex. 1013 ¶¶ 6–9; see Reply 6–8. Claims 1, 10, and 17 do not
require any specific level of precision and we determine that the speculative
concerns over potential impediments do not support Patent Owner’s
assertion that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a
reasonable expectation of success if relying on the timing control teachings
of Nakamura.
Patent Owner further argues that Nakamura does not disclose “bit
detection.” PO Resp. 28–31. Patent Owner’s argument is beyond the scope
of claims 10 and 17, which do not require “bit detection.” Claim 1 also does
23

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
not recite “bit detection,” but Petitioner contends that the ’870 patent
describes structure corresponding to the “means . . . for timing” based on
whether a “bit pattern” is detected. Pet. 24. Patent Owner argues, as
supported by Dr. Heidari, that “detecting the repetitive duration of the
preamble” in Nakamura corresponds to “detecting repetitive (alternating)
180-degree shifts in the received analog RF phase-modulated signal,” not to
detecting individual modulation bits for “bit detection.” PO Resp. 29–30;
Ex. 2006 ¶¶ 66–75. According to Patent Owner, Nakamura performs “no
identification of individual digital bits (i.e., binary ones (1s) or zeros (0s)).”
PO Resp. 30. Nakamura, however, expressly states that:
In the case of the digitized quadrature phase shift keying,
the preamble added as the heading to the transmission burst
signal typically has non-modulated duration in which all bits
are “0” or “1” and repetitive duration in which “0” and “1” are
repeated, and the nonmodulated duration is used for carrier
recovery and the repetitive duration for timing recovery.
Ex. 1005, 2:20–26. According to Prof. Ding, “by ‘detecting the repetitive
duration of the preamble,’ Nakamura’s circuit necessarily detects the bit
pattern represented by the repetitive duration,” and “describes such detection
as useful in transferring switch 14.” Ex. 1013 ¶ 17. We are persuaded that
Nakamura’s teaching of detecting a repetitive duration in the preamble for
timing corresponds to the use of the detection of a unique word for timing a
transition in the ’870 patent. See Reply 15–16.

Patent 5,712,870
f. Claim 1 – “means for providing the demodulated data signal to a
media access control (MAC) layer”
Claims 10 and 17 – “an interface for providing the demodulated data
signal to a media access control (MAC layer)”
Petitioner has shown that interface circuit 62 of the ’870 patent
corresponds to the claimed “means for providing the demodulated data
signal to a media access control (MAC) layer.” Pet. 22–23. Fischer’s RF
modem 96 generates a demodulated data signal and, through interface 122,
provides the signal to microcontroller 90, which implements a MAC layer,
and, in turn, implements a MAC protocol. Pet. 25; Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 35, 39.
Patent Owner does not substantively dispute Petitioner’s assertion that
Fischer teaches each of these limitations.
4.

Claims 2 and 11

Claim 2 depends from claim 1 and further requires “means for
adjusting said means for timing to account for headers of variable length.”
Similarly, claim 11, which depends from claim 10, further requires “wherein
said timer is adjustable to account for headers of variable length.” Petitioner
has shown that processor interface 114 of the ’870 patent corresponds to the
claimed “means for adjusting.” Pet. 24. Petitioner asserts that Fischer RF
modem 96 may transmit and receive transfer units that include a header of
variable length, and includes a spread spectrum controller 116 for control
and timing which is structurally equivalent to processor interface 114 of the
’870 patent. Pet. 26–27.
The Petition makes no mention of Nakamura in its discussion of the
additional limitations of claims 2 and 11. Yet in reply, Petitioner argues that
“[i]n view of Fischer’s variable length preambles, a [person of ordinary skill
25

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
in the art] would have found it obvious to utilize Nakamura’s timer function
and its repetitive duration function.” Reply 15. Petitioner may not rely on a
new argument asserting that Nakamura teaches the additional limitations for
claims 2 and 11 presented for the first time in its Reply. Moreover,
Petitioner fails to address how either Fischer or Nakamura teaches means for
adjusting means for timing when Fischer contains no timer, and when the
timer of Nakamura is described as being based on a predetermined period of
time. See Ex. 1005, 6:31–36 (“timer 34 permits the switch 14 to transfer
from terminal A to terminal B after the lapse of predetermined time”); see
also Ex. 2006, ¶¶ 83–84. Petitioner’s contention that “Nakamura’s timer is
also flexible” is insufficiently supported by any reference to either
Nakamura or the declaration of Prof. Ding. See Reply 16–17; see also
Ex. 1013 (no discussion of claims 2 or 11). Petitioner has not demonstrated
that the features of claims 2 or 11 are disclosed by the combination of
Fischer and Nakamura.
5.

Claims 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, and 18–20

Petitioner has persuasively shown that each of the additional
limitations of dependent claims 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, and 18–20 are taught by
the combination of Fischer and Nakamura. For example, claims 4, 14, and
19 all require a “single monolithic device.” Petitioner has shown that
Fischer RF modem 96 is a single monolithic device, and that Fischer
communicator 60 is a circuit contained on a single monolithic device that
includes RF modem 60. See Pet. 27–28; Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 41–42. Petitioner has
also shown that RF modem 96 includes coherent demodulator 114 that
provides in-phase and quadrature data outputs that are responsive to an
26

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
analog signal that has in-phase and quadrature components, corresponding to
the requirements of an analog signal “in the form of in-phase and quadrature
components” as recited in claims 5 and 16. See Pet. 28–29; Ex. 1003 ¶ 38.
With respect to the limitations of claims 6, 16, and 20 requiring PN
modulation and phase shift keyed modulation, Petitioner has shown that
Fischer discloses RF modem 96 supports BPSK or QPSK, and that it would
have been obvious to implement direct sequence spread modulation by using
PN modulation. See Pet. 29; Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 34, 37. We are also persuaded that
Fischer discloses the “antenna selection circuitry” as recited in claim 13 and
the “serial data stream” as recited in claim 18. See Pet. 30–31; Ex. 1003
¶ 40. Patent Owner does not substantively dispute Petitioner’s assertion that
Fischer teaches each of these limitations.
6.

Rationale for the Combination of Fischer and Nakamura

To demonstrate that the challenged claims are unpatentable, Petitioner
argues that it would have been obvious to use Fischer’s demodulator in a
BPSK mode for the preamble portion of the patent and Fischer’s QPSK
mode for the data portion of the same packet by integrating the timing and
control teachings of Nakamura to transition from BPSK to QPSK into
Fischer’s coherent demodulator 114. See Pet. 20–21; Reply 10. Petitioner
reasons that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated
to combine Fischer and Nakamura “in order to improve reliability of
wireless network communications.” Pet. 13.
In particular, Petitioner contends that reliability and efficiency would
be enhanced by integrating BPSK demodulation of the header portion, as
taught by Nakamura, to the QPSK implementation of Fischer, thereby
27

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
utilizing the reliability advantages of BPSK relative to QPSK to improve
synchronization of the header portion. Id. at 14. Nakamura further explains
the benefit of using BPSK for the preamble (or header) as being superior to
QPSK “in point of noise-proof capability.” Ex. 1005, 2:26–30. Fischer also
explains that BPSK “functionally is identical to QPSK functionality, other
than for data rate (half as fast), and synchronization time.” Ex. 1004, 16:9–
11. Thus, Petitioner asserts that a person of ordinary skill in the art “would
have combined Fischer and Nakamura in order to balance the improvement
of reliability gained through the application of BPSK to the header with the
maintenance of efficiency through the continued application of QPSK to
other portions of the packet.” Reply 5.
Patent Owner contends that “[i]f reliability alone is the concern,” then
“the most reliable method is to use BPSK for the entire packet (as taught by
Fischer).” PO Resp. 38. We are not, however, persuaded that “reliability
alone is the concern.” Nakamura and Fischer clearly teach a benefit to using
both BPSK and QPSK consisting of improved reliability for BPSK with
enhanced speed from QPSK. Thus, we find Patent Owner’s contention that
those of skill “would not look beyond the teachings of Fischer”
unpersuasive. See id. Likewise, Patent Owner’s contention that Fischer
already teaches improved reliability by using longer preambles has no
bearing on whether one of ordinary skill in the art would have also looked to
Nakamura for other means of improving reliability. See id. at 39. We find
that Petitioner articulates sufficient reasoning with rational underpinnings.
See In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (cited with approval in
KSR Int’l. Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007)).

C.

Obviousness Over Fischer, Nakamura, and Tsuda

Petitioner asserts that claim 15, which depends from claim 10, is
unpatentable as obvious over Fischer, Nakamura, and Tsuda. Pet. 34–37.
Claim 15 relates to resetting the circuit if no unique word within a message
header “is acquired within a predetermined period of time.”
Tsuda is titled “Method and Apparatus for Establishing and
Maintaining Frame Synchronization in a Satellite Communication System.”
Ex. 1009. As explained by Petitioner, Tsuda describes a frame
synchronization system that detects a unique word (UW) within a preamble.
Pet. 35. Tsuda describes an aperture generator to control the detection
aperture of a UW detector, in which the aperture of the UW detector is the
time period that the UW detector remains “open” to detect the
communication signal. Ex. 1009, 2:30–33, 8:1–5. The UW detector is
permitted “to detect a unique word only during that time period designated
by the aperture signal.” Ex. 1009, 2:32–33. Tsuda further explains a
process whereby the aperture generator continues to generate a series of
aperture signals to enable the UW detector to detect subsequent unique
words in the communication signal, and frame synchronization is only
established after the UWs have been detected a number (“I”) of consecutive
times. Id. at 2:34–45.
Patent Owner’s argument that Tsuda relies only on a failure to detect
unique words over a number of consecutive times, not a “predetermined
period of time,” as claimed, is not persuasive. See PO Resp. 40–46. We
agree with Petitioner that whether Tsuda repeats the process a number of
consecutive times has no bearing on the fact that Tsuda discloses the recited
29

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
claim limitation. Patent Owner concedes that Tsuda teaches that “if a unique
word is not detected in the first frame, processing will be returned to step
101 in a first amount of time.” PO Resp. 45. That, alone, teaches the
additional limitation of claim 15.
As a rationale to support the combination of Tsuda with Fischer and
Nakamura, Petitioner contends that improvements to the reliability of
Nakamura’s bit detection would follow from integration of Tsuda’s
“techniques that utilize a combination of patterns within fixed data and
unique words to enable reliable detection of bit patterns.” Pet. 34. We find
not persuasive Patent Owner’s argument that because Tsuda uses unique
words for a different purpose from the ’870 patent, one of ordinary skill in
the art would not look to Tsuda to address problems solved by the ’870
patent. PO Resp. 46–47. Claim 15 is not limited to a particular purpose and
Tsuda, like Fischer and Nakamura, is in the same field of endeavor of
wireless communications and modulation schemes. See Pet. 34. We find
that Petitioner articulates sufficient reasoning with rational underpinnings to
support the described combination of Tsuda with Fischer and Nakamura.

Conclusion

Petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that claims
1, 4–6, 10, 13, 14, and 16–20 would have been obvious over Fischer and
Nakamura, and that claim 15 would have been obvious over Fischer,
Nakamura, and Tsuda. Petitioner has not shown by a preponderance of the
evidence that claims 2 and 11 would have been obvious over Fischer and
Nakamura.
III. MOTION
A.

Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude

Patent Owner seeks to exclude paragraphs 2–5 of the Reply
Declaration of Prof. Ding (Exhibit 1013) and U.S. Patent No 4,649,549 (“the
’549 patent”). Paper 44. Patent Owner contends the material sought to be
excluded is “new evidence necessary to make out a prima facie case” and
“new evidence that could have been presented in a prior filing.” Id. at 1–2.
Patent Owner further asserts that paragraph 4 of Exhibit 1013 is inadmissible
hearsay testimony regarding the ’549 patent. Id. at 2. Petitioner opposes the
Motion (Paper 47) and Patent Owner filed a Reply (Paper 48).
As the movant, Patent Owner has the burden of proof to establish that
it is entitled to the requested relief. See 37 C.F.R. § 42.20(c). For the
reasons stated below, Patent Owner’s motion to exclude is denied.
Having considered the parties’ contentions and evidence, we are not
persuaded that paragraphs 2–5 of the Reply Declaration of Prof. Ding should
be excluded. A motion to exclude is not a mechanism to argue that a reply
contains new arguments or relies on evidence necessary to make out a prima
facie case. A motion to exclude, for instance, must state why the evidence is
31

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
inadmissible (e.g., based on relevance or hearsay), identify the
corresponding objection in the record, and explain the objection. See
37 C.F.R. § 42.64(c); Office Patent Trial Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg.
48,756, 48,767 (Aug. 14, 2012). Whether a reply contains arguments or
evidence that are outside the scope of a proper reply under 37 C.F.R.
§ 42.23(b) is left to our determination.
Nor has Patent Owner shown that paragraph 4 of Prof. Ding’s Reply
Declaration (Exhibit 1013) regarding the ’549 patent is inadmissible
hearsay. Patent Owner contends that any testimony about the ’549 patent is
hearsay because the ’549 patent “has not itself been offered into evidence in
this Proceeding.” Paper 44, 9. The ’549 patent, however, is discussed in
Fischer. See Ex. 1004, 17:19–22. Patent Owner cross-examined Prof. Ding
regarding the ʼ549 patent at his deposition. Ex. 2008, 78:2–83:12. Patent
Owner does not explain why this does not avoidany hearsay problems that
might be raised by Prof. Ding’s testimony regarding the patent. We are,
therefore, not persuaded that any mention of the ’549 patent in Prof. Ding’s
reply declaration is necessarily hearsay and should be excluded.
IV. ORDER
In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby:
ORDERED that, based on a preponderance of the evidence, claims 1,
4–6, 10, and 13–20 of U.S. Patent No. 5,712,870 are unpatentable;
FURTHER ORDERED that, based on a preponderance of the
evidence, claims 2 and 11 of U.S. Patent No. 5,712,870 have not been shown
to be unpatentable;

32

IPR2014-00548
Patent 5,712,870
FURTHER ORDERED that Patent Owner’s motion to exclude
evidence is denied; and
FURTHER ORDERED that, because this is a Final Written Decision,
the parties to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must
comply with the notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
