DECISION
Denying Institution of Inter Partes Review
37 C.F.R. § 42.108
Petitioner filed a Petition for an inter partes review of claims 1–26 of
U.S. Patent No. 5,718,737 (Ex. 1001, “the ’737 patent”). Paper 1 (“Pet.”).
Patent Owner filed a Preliminary Response. Paper 8 (“Prelim. Resp.”)

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
Applying the standard set forth in 35 U.S.C. § 314(a), which requires
demonstration of a reasonable likelihood that Petitioner would prevail with
respect to at least one challenged claim, we deny the Petition.
I. BACKGROUND
A. Related Proceedings
Petitioner identifies a related district court action involving the ’737
patent. Pet. 1 (citing Green Mountain Glass, LLC v. Saint-Gobain
Containers, Inc. d/b/a Verallia North America n/k/a Ardagh Glass Inc.,
No. 14-cv-00392 (D. Del., filed Mar. 28, 2014) (J. Sleet)).
B. The ’737 Patent (Ex. 1001)
The ’737 patent relates to a method of creating recycled glass
products from mixed color glass cullet, that is, crushed or broken pieces of
mixed-color glass. Ex. 1001, 1:14–15 (“mixed color cullet (i.e., broken
pieces of glass of mixed colors and types) can be recycled to make useful
glass products”). Mixed color glass cullet includes varying percentages of
green, amber, and flint (colorless) glass. Id. at 2:1–5.
The color distribution of glass in post-consumer solid municipal
waste, and in typical mixed color glass cullet, varies regionally. Id. at 2:1-2.
According to the disclosure of the ’737 patent, at the time of the invention,
mixed color glass cullet “had only limited commercial use,” for example, “as
an aggregate in paving material” or “land-fill cover,” and often was
“discarded in landfills.” Id. at 2:5–8. Mixed color glass cullet, therefore,
was “substantially less valuable than color sorted cullet.” Id. at 2:8–9.
The invention is directed to “a process for re-using mixed colored
glass, wherein mixed colored cullet can be used like color sorted cullet, to
make new and useful glass products.” Id. at 2:10–13. Because “sorting is
2

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
not fully effective, what is needed and provided according to the present
invention is a method selectively to colorize and/or decolorize one of the
colors in the mixed colored cullet to render it useful in the manufacture of
glass products of the other color.” Id. at 2:13–17; see id. at 3:29–40 (an
aspect of the invention is that mixed color cullet “is selectively decolorized
and/or colorized to a desired color”).
C. Illustrative Claim
Independent claim 1 is illustrative and is reproduced below.
A method of creating recycled glass products, comprising
the steps of:
obtaining unsorted mixed color glass cullet having glass
of at least two different colors;
adding to said mixed color glass cullet at least one of a
decolorizing agent which selectively decolorizes at least one of
the colors of said unsorted mixed color glass cullet and a
colorizing agent which enhances a remaining color of said
unsorted mixed color glass cullet;
melting the mixed color glass cullet and any agent added
in said adding step to a molten state; and
creating a recycled glass product of said remaining color
from the selectively colorized/decolorized molten mixed color
glass cullet.
Ex. 1001, 7:39–54.
Independent claims 1, 9 and 18 are directed to methods of creating
recycled glass products. Id. at 7:39–54; 8:14–29; 8:61–9:13. Claim 1 recites
that such products are created from unsorted mixed color glass cullet and
does not require any virgin (i.e., non-recycled) glass. Independent claims 9
and 18, on the other hand, require virgin glass, either in the form of a melt

3

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
(claim 9) or batch mixture (claim 18), where the melt or batch is “for glass
of a particular color.” Id. at 8:19–21; 8:65–67.
Similar to the “adding” step in claim 1, independent claims 9 and 18
require addition of “at least one of a decolorizing agent which selectively
decolorizes at least one of the colors of [the] unsorted mixed color glass
cullet other than [the] particular color and a colorizing agent which enhances
[the] particular color of [the] unsorted mixed color glass cullet,” where the
“particular color” corresponds to the color of the virgin glass melt or batch.
Id. at 8:22–27 (claim 9); 9:1–6 (claim 18).
C. Evidence Relied Upon
The Petition relies on the following prior art references:

II. ANALYSIS
A. Claim Construction
In an inter partes review, claim terms in an unexpired patent are given
their broadest reasonable interpretation in light of the specification of the
patent in which they appear. 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b); see In re Cuozzo Speed
Tech., LLC, 793 F.3d 1268, 1275–79 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The ’737 patent
appears to have expired on March 3, 2015, which would dictate an
application of the approach set forth in Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d
1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005); see In re Rambus Inc., 694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir.
2012) (“the Board’s review of the claims of an expired patent is similar to
that of a district court’s review”) (internal citation omitted). The result is the
same regardless of which claim construction standard is applied here.
We give claim terms their ordinary and customary meaning, as
understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, in the context of the entire
disclosure. In re Translogic Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249, 1257 (Fed. Cir.
2007). No claim term requires express construction for the purposes of this
decision. See, e.g., Wellman, Inc. v. Eastman Chem. Co., 642 F.3d 1355,
1361 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (“claim terms need only be construed ‘to the extent
necessary to resolve the controversy’”) (quoting Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am.
Sci. & Eng’g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).
5

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
B. An Overview of the Asserted Prior Art
We consider the asserted prior art as representative of the level of
ordinary skill in the art. See Okajima v. Bourdeau, 261 F.3d 1350, 1355
(Fed. Cir. 2001) (“[T]he absence of specific findings on the level of skill in
the art does not give rise to reversible error ‘where the prior art itself reflects
an appropriate level and a need for testimony is not shown’”) (quoting Litton
Indus. Prods., Inc. v. Solid State Sys. Corp., 755 F.2d 158, 163 (Fed. Cir.
1985)). The information presented shows the following facts about the
asserted prior art.
Nix discloses a method for calculating the redox number of glass
batches containing recycled cullet. Ex. 1004, Title, 278.1 According to Nix,
the redox state is important for forecasting the color of the glass, and an
accurate method for calculating the redox state of a batch is necessary for
predicting the properties of the melted glass. Id. at 271.
Nix explains that modern container glass batches include appreciable
quantities of recycled cullet and, for determining the redox number of those
batches, a calculation method that includes a redox factor for recycled cullet
is required. Id. Nix calculates “a first theoretical approximation” of a redox
factor for recycled cullet based on several assumptions: 2000 kg of SiO2 in
the glass batch, a typical mixture of green, flint, and amber glass found in
Germany, a mean chemical analysis of recycled cullet, and a level of organic
contamination in the recycled cullet. Id. at 273–75.
Nix verifies the theoretically calculated figure by preparing laboratory
melts of dead leaf green glass containing recycled cullet and comparing the
1

Citations to Nix, Ex. 1004, are to the original page numbers.
6

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
color with melts prepared from batches of known redox number. Id. at 275–
77. Using the calculated and verified redox number for recycled cullet, Nix
provides the following example of a redox calculation for a dead leaf green
glass batch containing recycled cullet:

Id. at 278.
Wilsker discloses “an improved process of glass manufacture” that
nullifies an “objectionable colouring effect of ingredients rich in iron.”
Ex. 1005, 1:20–26. Wilsker addresses a “peculiar bluish-green colour” that
“is most difficult to remove” and that results from using “common red or
brown sand having a high iron content” instead of “more costly white sand”
in the manufacture of soda-lime glass. Id. at 1:9–32.
Dusdorf discloses combining mixed color cullet with virgin glass
materials. Pet. 46 (citing Ex. 1007, 4). Dusdorf states that “brown glasses
are produced nowadays using mixed cullet.” Id. 45 (citing Ex. 1007, 3).
Baltazar discusses “the San Miguel Glassworks experience in the use of high
level cullet up to 80% and the use of flint/green cullet in amber glass.” Id.
(quoting Ex. 1008, 47 (Abstract)).
7

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
The Petition sets forth other assertions characterizing the disclosures
of Dusdorf and Baltazar, with citations to declaration testimony, but no
citations to the references themselves. Pet. 42–44. We do not accept those
assertions, which are not consistent with applicable procedural requirements.
See 37 C.F.R. § 42.22(a)(2) (petition must contain a “full statement of the
reasons for the relief requested, including a detailed explanation of the
significance of the evidence”); see also 37 C.F.R. § 42.6(a)(3) (prohibiting
argument made in a supporting document from being incorporated by
reference into a petition).
C. Obviousness of Claims 1–26
Over Nix, Wilsker, Dusdorf, and Baltazar
Petitioner alleges that the subject matter of claims 1–26 would have
been obvious at the time of the invention over the combined teachings of
Nix, Wilsker, Dusdorf, and Baltazar. Pet. 5, 42. Our decision with respect
to claim 1, and its dependent claims, turns on Petitioner’s failure to set forth
a cogent explanation of how the combined teachings of those references
would have suggested to a skilled artisan a method of creating a recycled
glass product “of” a “remaining color,” where a decolorizing agent
selectively decolorizes at least one of the colors of unsorted mixed color
glass cullet or a colorizing agent enhances the “remaining color.” Ex. 1001,
7:39-54 (claim 1). Nor does Petitioner, with respect to claims 9 and 18 and
their dependent claims, explain how the combined teachings would have
suggested a method of creating a recycled glass product of a “particular
color,” where a decolorizing agent selectively decolorizes at least one of the
colors of unsorted mixed color glass cullet or a colorizing agent enhances

8

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
the “particular color” of the virgin glass melt or batch. Id. at 8:14–29; 8:61–
9:12 (independent claims 9, and 18).
In that regard, Petitioner shows sufficiently that Nix discloses an
example of a dead leaf green laboratory glass melt from a batch that includes
mixed color glass cullet. Pet. 18 (citing Ex. 1004, 278); see id. at 44–47
(incorporating anticipation arguments as to Nix and Wilsker in the analysis
of the obviousness ground). Petitioner argues that the carbon in that
example is a colorizing agent within the scope of the challenged claims. Id.
at 18. Carbon is identified in the ’737 patent as a preferred colorizing agent
for amber glass. Ex. 1001, 6:35–42 (including carbon in list of preferred
coloring agents for amber glass production).
Petitioner states that carbon “is added to the batch for making dead
leaf green glass (e.g., a particular color)” but does not show that carbon
enhances the “dead leaf green” color of the batch. Pet. 18. In fact, the
information presented shows that carbon, as a reducing agent, enhances an
amber, not green, color. See Pet. 19–20 (by adding reducing agents, “the
amber color will be enhanced by reduction of the sulfur in the cullet, since
reduced sulfur is the source of amber color”); see also Ex. 1001, 7:5–29
(sole example in the ’737 patent, explaining that “[t]he addition of carbon,
(reducing agent) controls the final amber color, i.e., as carbon content
increases, the reddish-brown hue increases”).
According to Petitioner, dead leaf green is a “desired color” of the
glass batch in Nix’s example. Pet. 19 (citing Ex. 1004, 278). Even
assuming that dead leaf green is a “remaining color” in accordance with
claim 1 or a “particular color” in accordance with claims 9 and 18, Petitioner
does not show that this dead leaf green color is enhanced by carbon or any
9

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
other colorizing agent in Nix’s example. Ex. 1001, 7:39–54; 8:14–29; 8:61–
9:12 (independent claims). Stated in a different way, carbon is shown to
enhance amber color, but Nix does not suggest a method of “creating a
recycled glass product of” an amber color enhanced by carbon. Ex. 1001,
7:39–54; 8:14–29; 8:61–9:12 (claims 1, 9, and 18).
Petitioner also asserts that Nix discloses “a methodology for adding
reducing agents and oxidizing agents to selectively colorize and decolorize
particular colors by adjusting the redox numbers of the batch to arrive at a
desired color.” Pet. 19 (emphasis omitted). That assertion misstates the
disclosure of Nix. Petitioner directs us to no teaching in Nix of “a
methodology” for adjusting the redox number of the dead leaf green glass of
the example to produce amber glass, “just as was done in the Example in
the ’737 patent.” Id. at 20. That argument is fraught with hindsight bias.
See Graham, 383 U.S. 1, 36 (1966) (warning against a “temptation to read
into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue”).
The Petition speculates, without support in Nix, that if amber glass
were desired, a person of ordinary skill in the art would modify the example
disclosed on page 278 of Nix (see page 7, supra) by adding reducing agents,
such as Carbocite™, iron pyrite, or arsenic oxide. Pet. 19. Although the
Petition cites Nix, page 272, lines 2–7 and Table 1, neither teaches or
suggests modification of Nix’s dead leaf green batch in the manner
postulated by Petitioner. At best, Nix suggests that “a stronger amber
colouration” of the dead leaf green batch could be obtained by using a
reducing atmosphere above the melt. Ex. 1004, 278. But Nix teaches that
such extreme reducing conditions should be avoided. Id. (“care has to be

10

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
taken . . . to ensure that extreme oxidizing or reducing conditions do not
occur in the atmosphere above the melts.”).
On this record, Petitioner does not direct us to disclosure in Nix
sufficient to teach or suggest adding a decolorizing agent, which selectively
decolorizes at least one color of unsorted mixed color glass cullet, or a
colorizing agent, which enhances a “remaining color” of unsorted mixed
color glass cullet or a “particular color” of a virgin glass melt or batch, as
recited in the independent claims of the ’737 patent. We agree with Patent
Owner that “Nix does not disclose adding any colorizing agent to enhance a
color of the mixed color cullet, much less adding a colorizing agent to
enhance a remaining color not decolorized.” Prelim. Resp. 12. Petitioner
advances three other references as suggesting that feature of the invention—
Wilsker, Dusdorf, and Baltazar—but does not provide an “articulated
reasoning with some rational underpinning” showing how the combined
teachings of the applied prior art would have led a skilled artisan to that
feature. In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (cited with approval
in KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007)).
Wilsker is concerned with a “peculiar bluish-green colour” that results
when “materials rich in iron” are used to produce soda-lime glass. Ex. 1005,
1:9–29. Wilsker recognizes that the “objectionable” bluish-green color “is
due solely to the fact that the iron oxide contained in the [starting] materials
is in the ferrous state.” Id. at 1:27–32. Wilsker’s object is to nullify that
bluish-green color, which according to Wilsker, is produced when “common
red or brown sand having a high iron content” is used in place of “more
costly white sand having a comparatively low iron content.” Id. at 1:15–19.
Wilsker accomplishes that object by controlling the proportions of the
11

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
ingredients containing ferric oxide and ferrous oxide and furnace conditions
during melting. Id. at 1:37–48. Thereby, “the iron content of the finished
glass consists of both such oxides in equal proportions by weight.” Id.
at 1:41–44.
Petitioner suggests that Wilsker teaches a method in which “common
red sand selectively removes a ‘bluish-green colour’” and “iron oxide in the
ferrous state . . . selectively enhances a ‘bluish-green colour.’” Pet. 35
(citation omitted). Wilsker, however, irrefutably is concerned with
nullifying, not enhancing, that “objectionable” color. See Ex. 1005, 1:20–
36. Wilsker’s attempt to nullify the bluish-green color, moreover, is not
shown on this record to represent a selective decolorization or colorization
of “unsorted mixed color glass cullet” as required by each challenged claim.
Ex. 1001, 7:45–47; 8:22–24; 9:2–5 (independent claims 1, 9, and 18).
We recognize that Wilsker discloses an example glass batch
containing “cullet” and “small proportions of . . . decolourising or colourcorrecting agents.” Ex. 1005, 1:98–106, 2:1–26. The information presented,
however, does not show sufficiently that Wilsker suggests compensating for
the colors of unsorted mixed color glass cullet by addition of those agents.
On the contrary, Wilsker contemplates adding selected colors of glass cullet
according to the desired whiteness of the glass. Id.at 3:5–13 (“If desired,
white or pale green cullet may be replaced by a mixture of dark green and
amber cullet to an extent varying between 15% and 50%, according to the
desired whiteness of the glass . . . .”). Wilsker aims to make white soda-lime
glass from white and red sand and suggests that limited amounts of certain
colors of cullet can be added without degrading the white color. Id. 1:102,
3:5–13, 3:25–26 (claim 1). But Petitioner does not direct us to disclosure in
12

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
Wilsker sufficient to suggest the functionality of the decolorizing or
colorizing agents relative to unsorted mixed color glass cullet, as recited in
the “adding” step of independent claims 1, 9, and 18.
Petitioner further identifies, without elaboration, Baltazar’s reference
to a “color adjustment.” Pet. 46 (quoting Ex. 1008, 50). On this record,
neither Wilsker nor Baltazar is shown to have suggested a method of
creating recycled glass products, including adding a decolorizing agent,
which selectively decolorizes at least one color of unsorted mixed color
glass cullet, or a colorizing agent, which enhances a “remaining color” of
unsorted mixed color glass cullet or “particular color” of a virgin glass melt
or batch, as required by the independent claims. Ex. 1001, 7:39–54; 8:14–
29; 8:61–9:12 (claims 1, 9, 18).
Petitioner also directs us to Dusdorf for a disclosure of that limitation.
Pet. 46–47 (citing Ex. 1007, 1, 6). Dusdorf discloses melting amber glass
“under reducing conditions, generally with the addition of pulverized
carbon.” Ex. 1007, 1. Dusdorf attempts to identify a quantitative
relationship between glass color and chemical-analytical quantities of the
raw materials. Id. at 6. In that context, Dusdorf states that, “if no additional
coloring components such as Cr3+/Cr6+ are present,” then the brown glass
color can be quantified by the concentration of iron oxides and sulfate. Id.
On that basis, Petitioner proposes that, in Dusdorf, “brown glass is made by
adding Carbon as a decolorizing agent and/or adding ‘coloring components
such as Cr3+/Cr6+.[’]” Pet. 47 (citing Ex. 1007, 1, 6).
That proposition overstates the disclosure of Dusdorf. When read in
the context of the entire disclosure, Dusdorf’s reference to brown glass, in
which “no additional coloring components such as Cr3+/Cr6+ are present,”
13

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
fairly conveys the results of an analysis of the chromium ion content of
brown glass, but does not fairly suggest a selective addition of chromium
ions to enhance a color of mixed color glass cullet in a glass melt. Ex. 1007,
6. Furthermore, Petitioner does not explain adequately how carbon, which
on this record enhances an amber color, acts as a “decolorizing agent” in the
brown glass batches analyzed in Dusdorf. Pet. 47 (arguing that Dusdorf’s
“brown glass is made by adding Carbon as a decolorizing agent”); see
Ex. 1007, 1 (discussing variations of conditions that produce olive-brown or
gray colorizations). In that regard, Petitioner’s claim charts direct us to
page 6 of Dusdorf, but Petitioner does not explain adequately how or why
that disclosure would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to
determine “the amount of decolorizing agent to add to the batch by inputting
certain parameters into a computer program” or how to make “brown
glass . . . by adding Carbon as a decolorizing agent and/or adding ‘coloring
components such as Cr3+/Cr6+.” Pet. 46–47; see id. at 49–51 (claim charts).
Nor does Petitioner explain adequately how the teachings of Dusdorf would
have suggested the functionality of the decolorizing or colorizing agents
relative to unsorted mixed color glass cullet, as recited in the “adding” step
of independent claims 1, 9, and 18.
We have considered Petitioner’s other arguments that the combined
teachings of the asserted prior art would have suggested the claimed method.
Pet. 42–60. The Petition, however, does not provide analysis sufficient to
show that Wilsker and Nix suggest the limitations of any challenged claim,
or that Dusdorf and Baltazar “bridge the gap.” Prelim. Resp. 25. On this
record, Petitioner is not reasonably likely to prevail in showing that any

14

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
challenged claim is unpatentable as obvious over Nix, Wilsker, Dusdorf, and
Baltazar.
D. Anticipation of Claims 1–26 by Nix or Wilsker
Petitioner challenges claims 1–26 as anticipated by Nix, and 1, 6–9,
15–18, and 24–26 as anticipated by Wilsker. Pet. 4–5, 15, 32. Petitioner
does not discharge its burden of establishing a reasonable likelihood of
prevailing on either of those anticipation grounds. Accordingly, we decline
to institute trial based on anticipation by Nix or Wilsker.
For example, Petitioner does not show sufficiently that Nix discloses a
method of creating a recycled glass product “of” a “remaining color” of
unsorted mixed color glass cullet, or “of” a “particular color” corresponding
to the color of a virgin glass melt or batch. Ex. 1001, 7:39–54; 8:14–29;
8:61–9:12 (independent claims 1, 9, 18). Petitioner directs us to Nix’s
general disclosure of “[m]odern container glass batches” that “include
appreciable quantities of recycled cullet.” Pet. 20–21 (citing Ex. 1004, 271).
But that disclosure does not describe, with sufficient specificity, a step of
creating a recycled glass product of a “remaining” or “particular color,” as
required by each challenged claim. Ex. 1001, 7:48, 52; 8:25, 28; 8:67, 9:4,
10 (the independent claims).
Nor does Petitioner show sufficiently that Wilsker anticipates any
challenged claim. Pet. 32–41. As explained above in our analysis of the
obviousness challenge, Wilsker does not selectively colorize or decolorize
mixed color glass cullet, but rather, is concerned with nullifying a “peculiar
bluish-green colour” that is produced when “red or brown sand” is selected
over “more costly white sand” in the manufacture of commercial soda-lime
glass. Ex. 1005, 1:9–36.
15

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
Based on the information presented, Petitioner fails to show
sufficiently that Nix or Wilsker anticipates the subject matter of any
challenged claim.
[U]nless a reference discloses within the four corners of the
document not only all of the limitations claimed but also all of
the limitations arranged or combined in the same way as recited
in the claim, it cannot be said to prove prior invention of the
thing claimed, and, thus, cannot anticipate under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102.
Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 F.3d 1359, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
III. CONCLUSION
Based on the information presented in the Petition and the Preliminary
Response, Petitioner does not show a reasonable likelihood of prevailing
with respect to any claim challenged in the Petition.

It is
ORDERED that the Petition is denied, and no trial is instituted.
