BACKGROUND
Hewlett-Packard Co. (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition, Paper 2 (“Pet.”),
to institute an inter partes review of claims 1–21 (the “challenged claims”)
of U.S. Patent No. 5,777,992 (“the ’992 Patent”). 35 U.S.C. § 311. U.S.
Philips Corporation, Orange, S.A., TDF SAS, and Institut Für
Rundfunktechnik GMBH (collectively, “Patent Owner”) timely filed a
Preliminary Response, Paper 14 (“Prelim. Resp.”), contending that the
Petition should be denied as to all challenged claims. We have jurisdiction
under 37 C.F.R. § 42.4(a) and 35 U.S.C. § 314, which provides that an inter
partes review may not be instituted unless the information presented in the
Petition “shows that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would
prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition.”
Having considered the arguments and the associated evidence
presented in the Petition and the Patent Owner Preliminary Response, for the
reasons described below, we decline to institute an inter partes review of
any of the challenged claims.
REAL PARTIES IN INTEREST
Petitioner identifies itself as the only real party-in-interest. Pet. 1
PENDING LITIGATION AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS
The Petition states that ’992 Patent has been asserted in Audio MPEG,
Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., No. 2:15-cv-00073 (E.D. Va.). Pet. 1;
Paper 6, 2. Petitioner also identifies IPR2015-01507 (concerning
U.S. Patent No. 5,323,396) as filed concurrently with the Petition that is the
subject of this Petition.

THE ’992 PATENT (EXHIBIT 1001)
The ’992 Patent concerns a decoder, and a receiver incorporating a
decoder, for decoding an encoded digital signal that has been obtained by
encoding a wideband digital signal of a specific sampling frequency Fs, for
example, a digital audio signal. Ex. 1001, col. 1, ll. 20–23, 33–34. The
encoded digital signal comprises consecutive frames, where each frame has
a plurality of information packets, each packet having N bits. Id. at col. 1,
ll. 24–27. The information packets are fictitious units used to define the
length of a frame, so they need not be explicitly discernible in the
information stream of the encoded digital signal. Id. at col. 4, ll. 16–19. The
frames are divided into B information packets related to a calculated value P
to obtain faithful replica of the original wideband signal. Id. at col. 2, ll. 22–
25. The purpose of dividing the wideband signal into B information packets
is that, for a wide-band digital signal of a sampling frequency Fs, the average
frame rate of the encoded digital signal received is such that the duration of
a frame in the digital signal corresponds to the duration occupied by ns
samples of the wide-band signal. Id. at col. 2, ll. 25–47. A frame also
includes synchronization information. Id. at col. 1, ll. 28–29.
The decoder has an input for receiving the encoded digital signal and
is adapted to convert it and output a replica of the wideband digital signal.
Id. at col. 1, ll. 33–34.
Claim 1 reproduced below, is illustrative.

1. A decoder for decoding an encoded digital signal,
wherein the encoded digital signal represents a wideband
digital signal having a sampling frequency Fs, and the
encoded digital signal comprises consecutive frames,
each frame comprising a plurality of information packets,
each information packet comprising N bits, N being
larger than 1, a frame comprising at least a first frame
portion including synchronization information; and
wherein the decoder comprises:
an input for receiving the encoded digital signal,
means for converting the encoded digital signal
into a replica of the wideband digital signal,
and
an output for supplying the replica of the wideband
digital signal,
characterized in that said converter is arranged for
converting a signal having a number of
information packets in one frame determined
according to the formula
	
where BR is the bitrate of the encoded digital signal and
ns is the number of samples of the wideband digital signal
whose corresponding information in the encoded digital
signal is included in one frame of the encoded digital
signal, and
if P is an integer, the number of information
packets in one frame is P, and
if P is not an integer, the number of information
packets in a number v of the frames is P′, where
P′ is the highest integer whose value is less than
P; and the number of information packets in a
number w of the other frames is equal to P′+1,
the numbers v and w being selected such that
the average frame rate of the encoded digital
signal is substantially equal to Fs/ns.

CLAIM CONSTRUCTION
For the reasons discussed below, we do not reach the obviousness
issues, and no claim construction is necessary
ANALYSIS
Patentability challenges in an inter partes review must be “on the
basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications.” 35 U.S.C.
§ 311(b). Petitioner’s asserted grounds of unpatentability are based on three
non-patent references: Chambers, MPEG 89-051, and MASCAM 1988.
Pet. 2–3. Patent Owner asserts that Petitioner has not provided sufficient
evidence to show that any of these references is a printed publication.
Prelim. Resp. 8–18. Legal Standard Regarding Prior Art Printed
Publications
Petitioner has the initial burden of production of evidence establishing
that asserted references are applicable as prior art. Dynamic Drinkware LLC
v. Nat’l Graphics, Inc., 800 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
We look to the underlying facts to make a legal determination as to
whether a document is a printed publication. Suffolk Techs., LLC v. AOL
Inc., 752 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The determination of whether a
document is a “printed publication” under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) involves a
case-by-case inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding its
disclosure to members of the public. In re Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d 1345,
1350 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also In re Hall, 781 F.2d 897, 898–99 (Fed. Cir.
1986) (holding that “public accessibility” is the touchstone in determining
whether a reference is a “printed publication” under § 102).
To qualify as a printed publication, a document “must have been
sufficiently accessible to the public interested in the art.” In re Lister,
6 
 

IPR2015-01505
Patent 5,777,992
 

 

583 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The party seeking
to introduce the reference “should produce sufficient proof of its
dissemination or that it has otherwise been available and accessible to
persons concerned with the art to which the document relates and thus most
likely to avail themselves of its contents.” In re Wyer, 655 F.2d 221, 227
(CCPA 1981) (citation omitted); see also Cordis Corp. v. Boston Sci. Corp.,
561 F.3d 1319, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that “a document is publicly
accessible if it ‘has been disseminated or otherwise made available to the
extent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter or
art, exercising reasonable diligence, can locate it’” (citing In re Wyer, 655
F.2d at 226)).
Whether Chambers is Available as Prior Art
Petitioner asserts that Chambers “qualif[ies] as prior art under at least
35 U.S.C. § 102(b). Specifically, Chambers . . . was published in December
1985, . . . more than a year before the earliest priority date of the ‘396
Patent.”1 Pet. 3. The Petition, however, points to no specific evidence
supporting its assertion that Chambers was published in 1985.2
Chambers was cited in an ex parte reexamination request for the ’992
Patent filed by a third party, Timothy J. Maier. Ex. 1036, 145–168. The

We understand Petitioner to be referring to the ’992 Patent that is the
subject of this proceeding.
2
In an email to the Board on December 14, 2015 seeking authorization to
file a Reply to Patent Owner’s Preliminary Response, Petitioner asserted that
it “was surprised to see [Patent Owner’s] arguments” regarding the prior art
status of Chambers and MASCAM 1988 “[b]ecause Patent Owner[] had not
ever disputed that Chambers was prior art in previous ex parte reexams, and
because Patent Owner[] had submitted MASCAM 1988 as prior art in
previous Information Disclosure Statements.” We did not authorize
additional briefing on this issue. See Paper 15.

reexamination request states only that “Chambers was published in 1985,
five years prior to the ’992 patent’s filing date.” Id. at 149. There is no
other evidence in the reexamination file concerning Chambers’ status as
prior art. In the reexamination, Patent Owner elected to argue on the merits
that the claims of the ’992 Patent were patentable over Chambers. Ex. 1036,
346–352. At the end of the reexamination, the claims were confirmed. Id.
at 2012. Patent Owner’s choice to address Chambers on the merits rather
than challenge its prior art status does not relieve Petitioner of its initial
burden to put forth evidence in this inter partes proceeding that Chambers is
available as prior art to the ’992 Patent.
On its face, Chambers includes a “December 1985” date, as well as a
“BBC RD 1985/15” indication. Ex. 1014,3 1. The fact that a date is printed
on the face of a reference, without more, is not enough to establish that the
reference was publicly accessible on that date. See LG Elecs., Inc. v.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Case IPR2015-00329, slip op. at 13 (PTAB
July 10, 2015) (Paper 13); see also Google Inc. v. ART+COM
Innovationpool GmbH, Case IPR2015-00788, slip op. at 8 (PTAB Sept. 2,
2015) (Paper 7) (“[T]his bare date, without more, does not provide any
information about the date [the reference] was publicly accessible.”).
Further, the unsupported testimony of Dr. Jayant that “[Chambers] was
published in December 1985” (Ex. 1004 ¶ 94) also is insufficient to
demonstrate that Chambers was published in December 1985.
Patent Owner argues that the Petition includes no arguments or
evidence regarding “whether or how Chambers was distributed, or, if it was

distributed, whether that distribution was limited or subject to any
confidentiality restrictions.” Prelim. Resp. 12. Although Chambers is dated
December 1985 on its face, Petitioner provides no evidence concerning
when it was first published or distributed. In particular, Petitioner provides
no evidence that the British Broadcasting Corporation (“BBC”) made
Chambers publicly available in 1985, or how an interested person would
have located it. Petitioner likewise provides no evidence concerning the
general publication or distribution policies of the BBC.
Further, as noted by Patent Owner, Chambers includes other
information within the document itself that is inconsistent with a December
1985 publication date. See Prelim. Resp. 13. For example, Chambers
includes a copyright notice that is nearly 20 years after the alleged
December 1985 publication date—namely, “© BBC 2004”. Ex. 1014, 6.
Further, the “References” section of Chambers includes at least one citation
to a paper apparently published in February 1986, which also is after the
alleged December 1985 publication date. Ex. 1014, 18. These dates are
inconsistent with the December 1985 date printed on the face of the
document, and cast further doubt as to the public availability thereof as of
December 1985. Petitioner, however, makes no attempt to address or
explain these inconsistencies.
Accordingly, based on the evidence provided in the Petition, we
conclude Petitioner has not made a sufficient threshold showing that
Chambers is available as prior art in this proceeding.
Whether MPEG 89-051 is Available as Prior Art
We reach a similar conclusion with respect to MPEG 89-051. The
Petition states that MPEG 89-051 was made publicly available in February
9 
 

IPR2015-01505
Patent 5,777,992
 

 

1989, but the Petition does not discuss how this document was published or
distributed.4 Pet. 3. Petitioner also does not explain how a document
allegedly published in February 1989 includes an attachment, i.e., Annex V,
dated March 1989. Ex. 1010, 12. Based on the evidence in the Petition, we
conclude that Petitioner has not made a sufficient threshold showing that
MPEG 89-051 is available as prior art in this proceeding.
Whether MASCAM 1988 is Available as Prior Art
Petitioner also asserts that MASCAM 1988 was published in 1988,
but the Petition does not discuss how this document was published or
distributed.5 Pet. 3. MASCAM 1988 was submitted by Patent Owner in an
Information Disclosure Statement during the reexamination of the ’992
Patent discussed above. Ex. 1036, 986. Patent Owner’s Information
Disclosure Statement specifically states, however, that its submission is not
an admission that each or all of the listed documents constitute prior art and
that Patent Owner reserves the right to present relevant facts and law
concerning the status of such documents, if applied by the Examiner. Id. at
970–971. Patent Owner’s choice to submit MASCAM 1988 in an
Information Disclosure Statement in an earlier reexamination does not
relieve Petitioner of its initial burden to put forth evidence in this inter

The Declaration of Nikil Jayant, Ex. 1004 (“Jayant Decl.”), ¶¶ 65–78, 103,
provides some background concerning the workings of the MPEG Working
Group, but the Petition does not demonstrate that distribution to members of
the working group constitutes sufficient distribution to make MPEG 89-051
a printed publication.
5
The Jayant Declaration provides some background concerning the
workings of the MPEG Working Group, but the Petition does not
demonstrate that distribution to members of the working group constitutes
sufficient distribution to make MASCAM 1998 a printed publication. Jayant
Decl. ¶ 115–118.

partes proceeding that MASCAM 1988 is available as prior art. Based on
the evidence in the Petition, we conclude that Petitioner has not made a
sufficient threshold showing that MASCAM 1988 is available as prior art in
this proceeding.
SUMMARY
Petitioner has not shown a reasonable likelihood that it will succeed in
any of its challenges because Petitioner has not made a threshold showing
that any of the references cited in those challenges is available as prior art.
Therefore, we decline to institute inter partes review.
ORDER
Inter partes review of the claims of the ’992 Patent challenged by
Petitioner is not instituted.
