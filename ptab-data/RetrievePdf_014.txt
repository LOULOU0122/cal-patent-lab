INTRODUCTION

Nissan North America, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed a Corrected Petition, on
April 18, 2014, requesting an inter partes review of claims 1–6 and 9 of US Patent
No. 5,502,689 (Ex. 1001, “the ’689 patent”). Paper 5 (“Pet.”). Norman IP
Holdings, LLC (“Patent Owner”) filed a Preliminary Response on July 14, 2014.
Paper 10 (“Prelim. Resp.”). Petitioner also indicates that the ’689 patent was or is
involved in several district court actions. Pet. 1–4. On February 5, 2013, an ex
parte reexamination of the ’689 patent was filed, Control No. 90/012,784 (the
“Reexam”), which resulted in the cancellation of claims 5, 6, and 9. Ex. 3001.
Claims 1–4 and 7–8 were not reexamined.
On September 23, 2014, we instituted review as to claims 1–6 and 9 of the
’689 patent and instituted trial on the grounds of unpatentability as set forth below.

Patent 5,502,689
Patent Owner responded to the Petition (Paper 32, “PO Resp.”), and
Petitioner replied (Paper 35, “Reply”) to Patent Owner’s response. No oral hearing
was held in this case.
The Board has jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c). As an initial matter, we
decline to make a final ruling on independent claim 5 and dependent claims 6 and
9, which were cancelled in the Reexam. In particular, in the Reexam, a Certificate
was issued cancelling claims 5, 6, and 9. Ex. 3001. As a result, Petitioner’s
challenges to these three cancelled claims are moot. In this Final Written Decision,
issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73, we determine
Petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the following
claims for which trial was instituted, claims 1–4, are unpatentable.
A. The ’689 Patent
The ’689 Patent describes a way to reduce power consumption and conserve
the battery life of an electronic device by stopping the device’s clock signal. Ex.
1001, col. 1, ll. 59–63. A clock signal is a regularly timed pulse used to
synchronize the operations of a microprocessor.
If a microprocessor stops receiving clock pulses, it will stop executing
instructions and enter a “power-down” or “shut-down” mode in which power
consumption is reduced. Id. at col. 2, ll. 25–30. According to the ’689 Patent, this
method for reducing power consumption was well known in the prior art, but it
presented several problems. Id. at col. 2, l. 46, col. 3, l. 7. Software errors or noise
could trigger an inadvertent entry into shut-down mode, a premature entry into
shut-down mode, or entry into shut-down mode without any means to exit shut3

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
down mode. Id. at col. 2, l. 57, col. 3, l. 7. The ’689 Patent endeavors to solve
these problems by requiring that the signal requesting that the device enter shutdown mode conform to a protocol.
Referring to Figure 1, during normal operation, oscillator 10 generates
regular clock pulses which are ultimately sent to various modules in a device. Ex.
1001, col. 6, ll. 11–14, 20–22. When the device needs to enter shut-down mode, a
signal is sent to the clock generator on line 48. Id. at col. 7, ll. 59–62. Register
Access Circuit 20 provides a protection scheme to verify the signal on line 48. Id.
at col. 7, l. 59, col. 8, ll. 16. This protection scheme is a predetermined protocol
requirement, which avoids inadvertent placement of the clock generator into shutdown mode. Id. at col. 8, ll. 13–15. Once the signal on line 48 is verified, Register
Access Circuit 20 sends a SDENTR signal along line 30 to shut-down control
circuit 12. Id. at col. 8, ll. 33–38. This circuit sends a START TIMER signal to
Shut-Down Entry Delay Timer 14. Id. at ll. 34–41 (emphasis added). Timer 14
provides a delay for a “predetermined length of time” to allow one or more of the
device modules to enter an idle state. Id. at col. 4, ll. 13–20. After this delay, a
STOP OSCILLATOR signal is sent to Oscillator 10 to stop the clock pulses. Id. at
col. 8, ll. 44–46. The device is now in shut-down mode.
The “predetermined length of time” is calculated by means of a separate
clock. This clock, which is external to the clock generator, constantly sends clock
pulses to the Shut-Down Entry Delay Timer 14 at 280.9 Hz. Ex. 1001, col. 7, ll.
4–10. This clock is significantly slower than the clock pulses of Oscillator 10.
Once timer 14 receives the START TIMER signal, it waits to receive two clock

4

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
pulses from the external clock, and then sends the STOP OSCILLATOR signal.
Id. at col. 7, ll. 10–16.

Figure 2 is represented below:

Figure 2, depicted above, shows the timing of the shut-down process. At
time t0 the SDENTR signal is asserted. Ex. 1001, col. 8, ll. 30–34. At time t1
Timer 14 receives a first pulse from the external clock. At time t2, Timer 14
5

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
receives the second pulse, and shuts down Oscillator 10. Id. at col. 8, ll. 38–42. At
280.9 Hz, the time between each pulse of the external clock is 3.56ms. Because
the SDENTR signal may be asserted at any time, it may take between 3.56ms and
7.12ms for Timer 14 to receive two clock pulses from the external clock. Id. at
col. 8, ll. 38–43.
B. Illustrative Claim
Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed subject matter of the ’689 patent, and is
reproduced below:
1. A clock generator for an electrical system, said clock generator
capable of providing at least one output clock signal, said clock
generator comprising:
means for producing said at least one output clock signal;
means for disabling said means for producing upon reception of a
disable activation signal;
means for receiving a shut-down entry request signal; and
means for verifying that said received shut-down entry request signal
meets a predetermined protocol requirement, said means for verifying
comprising at least two registers, said means for verifying generating
said disable activation signal upon verification that a received shutdown entry request signal does meet said predetermined protocol
requirement, which disable activation signal is conducted to said
means for disabling.
Ex. 1001, col 11, ll. 41–56.

ANALYSIS

A. Level of Ordinary Skill
Neither party has made a statement about the level of ordinary skill in the art
applicable to this case.

We determine the obviousness issues guided by the

evidence of the level of ordinary skill in the art presented by the references
themselves. See Okajima v. Bourdeau, 261 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
Patent Owner does not contest Maejima is within the field of endeavor of the ’689
patent. We treat Maejima as representative of the level of ordinary skill in the art
at the time of the invention.
B. Claim Construction
The ’689 patent is expired. PO Resp. 7. While we generally construe claims
using the broadest reasonable construction, see 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b), “the Board’s
review of the claims of an expired patent is similar to that of a district court’s
review,” In re Rambus Inc., 694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (internal citations
omitted). Thus, we construe the claims in accordance with their ordinary and
customary meanings, as would be understood to a person of ordinary skill in the
art, in the context of the specification. See generally Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415
F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc).
Petitioner provides constructions for several claim terms. Pet. 6–8.
Petitioner proposes constructions for four means-plus-function limitations: means
for producing; means for disabling; means for receiving; and means for verifying.
Id. at 6–7. Patent Owner has not proposed constructions for any of these
limitations. In the Decision to Institute, we determined that the Petitioner’s
7

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
identification of the function and corresponding structure for these terms were
consistent with the Specification of the ’689 Patent; therefore, we adopted them.
Dec. 8. The parties do not dispute the constructions. PO Resp. 8; Reply 1–2.
Based on the complete record now before us, we discern no reason to change the
constructions; we adopt our previous analysis for the non-disputed claim terms.
We find that none of the other terms recited in the claims need to be construed
explicitly at this time.
C. Claims 1–4—Anticipated by AMD (Ex. 1002)
Petitioner argues that claims 1–4 are anticipated by AMD under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b). Pet. 9–17. AMD discloses the production of an output clock signal
(MCLK) and programmable divider, and the ability to disable this clock signal
when a POWER-DOWN mode is entered via a signal sent via data bus. AMD
discloses that “[t]he POWER-DOWN mode is entered by appropriate
programming of the INIT and INIT2 registers.” Ex. 1002, 9. When entering
POWER-DOWN mode, the DSC/IDC will begin an internal countdown of at least
250-MCLK cycles after which both the MCLK and XTAL1 outputs are both
stopped and held High, and the XTAL2 input will be disregarded, effectively
stopping all clocks to conserve power. Id.
Below we discuss independent claim 1, from which all other dependent
claims challenged in this ground depend. Claim 1 recites “means for producing
said at least one output clock signal.”
The structure corresponding to this limitation is a clock divider and
equivalents thereof. Pet. 6–7. Petitioner asserts that AMD’s disclosure of MCLK,
8

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
which is described as having the following output frequencies: 12.288, 6.144,
4.096, 3.072, 1.536, 0.768, and 0.384 MHz, meets this limitation. Id. at 10–11
(citing Ex. 1002, 8). We are persuaded by this cited disclosure. Thus, on the
record before us, Petitioner has shown sufficiently that AMD discloses this
limitation.
Claim 1 also recites “means for disabling said means for producing upon
reception of a disable activation signal.” The structure corresponding to this
limitation is a shut-down control circuit together with a shut-down entry delay
timer, and equivalents thereof. Pet. 7. Petitioner asserts that AMD’s disclosure of
POWER-DOWN mode and associated circuits, which is described as shutting
down all clocks, meets this limitation. Id. at 11 (citing Ex. 1002, 9). We are
persuaded by this cited disclosure. Thus, on the record before us, Petitioner has
shown sufficiently that AMD discloses this limitation.
Claim 1 also recites “means for receiving a shut-down entry request signal.”
The structure corresponding with this limitation is a data bus. Pet. 8. Petitioner
asserts that AMD’s disclosure of POWER-DOWN mode, which is described as
being entered by “appropriate programming of the INIT and INIT2 registers
[and] . . . is not available unless the POWER-DOWN ENABLE bit is set in the
INIT2 register,” meets this limitation. Id. at 11 (citing Ex. 1002, 9). We are
persuaded by this cited disclosure. Thus, on the record before us, Petitioner has
shown sufficiently that AMD discloses this limitation.
Claim 1 also recites
means for verifying that said received shut-down entry request signal
meets a predetermined protocol requirement, said means for verifying
comprising at least two registers, said means for verifying generating
9

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
said disable activation signal upon verification that a received shutdown entry request signal does meet said predetermined protocol
requirement, which disable activation signal is conducted to said
means for disabling.
The structure corresponding with this limitation is a register access circuit.
Pet. 8. Petitioner asserts that AMD’s disclosure of POWER-DOWN mode, which
is described as being entered by “appropriate programming of the INIT and INIT2
registers,” meets this limitation. Id. at 11 (citing Ex. 1002, 9). In addition, AMD
requires a special predetermined write procedure to modify the INIT2 register. Id.
Thus, on the record before us, Petitioner has shown sufficiently that AMD
discloses this limitation.
Patent Owner asserts that “[t]he Board’s Institution Decision likewise cites
‘appropriate programming of the INIT and INIT2 register’ as meeting both the
‘receiving’ and ‘verifying’ limitations, even though claim 1 clearly requires the
‘means for receiving’ to be a separate element from the ‘means for verifying.’” PO
Resp. 9 (citing Inst. Dec. 9.) Patent Owner suggests that separate structures have
not been identified for each means-plus-function limitation in a claim. We
disagree. The means for receiving is met by writing to INIT and INIT2 and
command registers. Pet. 10. The means for verifying is met by the register access
circuit that controls programming of INIT and INIT2. Id.
Patent Owner asserts “Petitioner identifies the corresponding structure that
performs the ‘means for receiving’ as a data bus and equivalents, the Petition does
not allege that AMD actually teaches a data bus.” We disagree. Petitioner states
that AMD discloses “a signal sent via a data bus.” Pet. 9.
10

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
Patent Owner asserts “the plain language of claim 1 requires that the means
for disabling receive the disable activation signal generated by the means for
verifying, [but] Petitioner has not identified such a disable activation signal that is
generated by a first ‘verifying’ component and received by a second, different
‘disabling’ component.” PO Resp. 10–11. We disagree. AMD discloses
“POWER-DOWN mode is not available unless the POWER-DOWN ENABLE bit
is set in the INIT2 register.” Ex. 1002, 9. AMD discloses that “[s]election of the
POWER-DOWN mode causes the DSC/DC to begin an Internal countdown of at
least 250-MCLK cycles.” Id. Thus, AMD discloses that upon proper
programming of the INIT and INIT2 registers the POWER-DOWN is verified and
a signal must be sent to begin the internal countdown of the 250-MCLK which
activates disable. See Pet. 10.
Claim 2 requires that the “means for verifying” further comprises “an
interlock mechanism capable of detecting writes to said at least two registers, and
wherein one of said at least two registers is a dummy register.” Claim 3 requires
“said interlock mechanism prevents write access to one of said at least two
registers unless said predetermined protocol requirement is met.” Claim 4 requires
that the “predetermined protocol requirement comprises a predetermined number
of writes in a predetermined order to said at least two registers.” Petitioner relies
on AMD’s disclosure of a special predetermined write procedure to meet these
limitations. Pet. 12–13 (citing Ex. 1002, 9–10). We are persuaded by these
citations.
Patent Owner asserts “Petitioner have not shown that AMD teaches a
predetermined number of writes to the at least two registers of the means for
11

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
verifying, as AMD actually teaches writing to two registers [the Command and
Data Registers] that are different from the registers [INIT and INIT2] alleged to be
the means for receiving.” PO Resp. 12. We disagree. Claim 4 requires writing to
“at least” two registers. The Petition points to INIT and INIT2 as two registers and
the Command and Data Registers as additional registers to which writes are made.
Pet. 13–14. We are persuaded that Petitioner has pointed to “at least two registers”
as required by claim 4.
To the extent that a limitation of the challenged claims is not discussed
above, Petitioner also provides detailed explanations of how each limitation of
claims 1–4 is disclosed by AMD. Pet. 9–17. Upon review of Petitioner’s and
Patent Owner’s analysis and supporting evidence, we are persuaded that Petitioner
has shown by a preponderance of evidence that claim 1, and claims 2–4, which
depend ultimately from claim 1, are anticipated by AMD.
D. Claims 1–4— Anticipated by Maejima (Ex. 1003)
Petitioner argues that claims 1–4 are anticipated under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) by
Maejima. Pet. 17–27. Maejima discloses a method of controlling a clock signal
supplied to a logic circuit in a data processing apparatus so as to inhibit the supply
of the clock signal to the logic circuit or fix the level of the clock signal at a
specific level at any time, thereby reducing the power consumption. Ex. 1003,
Abstract. Maejima also provides a method in which the extent of the circuit
region, for which the supply of the clock signal is inhibited, can be changed as
desired. Id.

12

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
Below we discuss independent claim 1, from which all other dependent
claims challenged in this ground depend. Claim 1 recites “means for producing
said at least one output clock signal.”
The structure corresponding to this limitation is a clock divider and
equivalents thereof. Pet. 6–7. Petitioner asserts that Maejima’s disclosure of clock
generating circuit 20 and clock supplying circuit 21, which is described as
generating clock output signals 3x to 3z, meets this limitation. Pet. 19 (citing Ex.
1003, col. 4, ll. 18–32). We are persuaded by this cited disclosure. Thus, on the
record before us, Petitioner has shown sufficiently that Maejima discloses this
limitation.
Claim 1 also recites “means for disabling said means for producing upon
reception of a disable activation signal.” The structure corresponding to this
limitation is a shut-down control circuit together with a shut-down entry delay
timer, and equivalents thereof. Pet. 7. Petitioner asserts that Maejima’s disclosure
of clock supply inhibit signal, which is described as inhibiting application of the
external clock signal, meets this limitation. Pet. 19–20 (citing Ex. 1003, col. 2, ll.
5–12, col. 4, ll. 46–56).
Claim 1 also recites “means for receiving a shut-down entry request signal.”
Petitioner asserts that Maejima’s disclosure of clock control circuit 327, which is
described as stopping clock signals 3x to 3z, meets this limitation. Pet. 20 (citing
Ex. 1003, col. 5, ll. 49–57). The structure corresponding with this limitation is a
data bus. Pet. 8. Patent Owner suggests that the Petition and Dr. Mercer’s
testimony construe receiving means as the clock supply circuit rather than a data
bus. PO Resp. 14–15. Petitioner states that:
13

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
Maejima discloses the production of an output clock signal (e.g. signals 3x–3z),
that is output from frequency dividers 120-125, and the ability to disable this clock
signal via decoder 27 and delay circuit 327, in response to the application of a
clock supply inhibit instruction (signal 3d) sent as output from IR 26 via a data bus
between decoder 27 and clock supply 21.”
Pet. 18 (emphasis added).
Claim 1 also recites
means for verifying that said received shut-down entry request signal
meets a predetermined protocol requirement, said means for verifying
comprising at least two registers, said means for verifying generating
said disable activation signal upon verification that a received shutdown entry request signal does meet said predetermined protocol
requirement, which disable activation signal is conducted to said
means for disabling.
The structure corresponding with this limitation is register access circuit.
Pet. 8. Petitioner asserts that Maejima’s disclosure of the process of shutting down
clock signals 3x to 3z, which begins by putting data n in program counter PC meets
this limitation. Pet. 20–22 (citing Ex. 1003, col. 4, ll. 43–57). Maejima discloses
“[referring to Fig. 7] [a]fter extension of a micro instruction ‘Memory Read’ in the
block 7h, the presence or absence of an interrupt request [in the memory address
register] is checked in the block 7i. When the result of checking in the block 7i
proves that the signal 2c indicative of the presence of an interrupt request appears
from the mask gate 324, the block 7i is followed by the block 7j so as to execute
the interrupt processing program.” Id. at 20–21.
Patent Owner argues:
Since Maejima teaches that the control instruction is read from
memory 28 into instruction register 26 based on the address stored in
14

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
memory address register 25, then sent to decoder 27, and finally via
clock supply stopping signal 3d used to control clock supply 21
(which includes clock control circuit 327), Maejima does not teach a
“means for verifying that said disable request signal satisfies a
predetermined protocol requirement” because the alleged “means for
verifying” in Maejima provide the signal received by the alleged
“means for receiving” and thus cannot verify a signal that itself is
sending to the “means for receiving.”
PO Resp. 17. Patent Owner provides an annotated version of Fig. 2 of Maejima,
which is reproduced below.

The annotated version of Fig. 2 of Maejima shows that Petitioner’s alleged
means for receiving receives input from the means for verifying, not the other way
around as required by claim 1. We agree. Petitioner does not provide an adequate
explanation to the contrary. In its reply, Petitioner notes that “in Fig. 4, signal 3d
enters the clock control and must pass through flip-flops 300 and 301 as the system
loops through Fig. 7 without being interrupted by an interrupt request on lines 3l3o, which becomes signal 3r. Paper 1, 18, 20-21 (“An interrupt signal (e.g. 3l-3o)
can unlock the clock supplying circuit 21, initiating the supply of clock signals
15

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
regardless of whether the interrupt signal is masked. . . . When [an interrupt is
present], the block 7i is followed by the block 7j so as to execute the interrupt
processing program. [If an interrupt is not present], the block 7i is followed by
execution of . . . the instruction fetched in the block 7g”).” Reply 11–12. This
does not explain why the alleged shutdown entry request signal (3d) is generated
after the verification which occurs in the MAR and IR. Compare Pet. 18
(“Maejima discloses . . . the ability to disable this clock signal via decoder 27 and
delay circuit 327, in response to the application of a clock supply inhibit
instruction (signal 3d) sent as output from IR 26 via a data bus between decoder 27
and clock supply 21.”) with id. (“Maejima discloses verification of the clock signal
inhibit instruction using PC 23 and specific programing of two registers, MAR and
IR.”). Thus, Petitioner has not sufficiently explained how, based on the assertions
in the Petition, Maejima meets the limitation of a “means for verifying that said
received shut-down entry request signal meets a predetermined protocol
requirement,” as recited in claim 1. Thus, Petitioner has not shown sufficiently
that Maejima discloses this limitation.
Petitioner argues that if the Board does not find Maejima anticipates claims
1–4, the result of this case will be inconsistent with the Reexam, which found
similar limitations of claim 5 were met by Maejima. We disagree. In the Reexam,
receiving a disable request signal was equated to “receiving/applying signal 2a
at/to the main memory 28”; See Col. 4, lines 43-45 and Fig. 2).” Ex. 1019, 7.
Here, Petitioner, who was aware of this public finding as of the filing of the
Petition, chose to rely on “the application of a clock supply inhibit instruction
(signal 3d) sent as output from IR 26 via a data bus between decoder 27 and clock
16

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
supply 21.” Pet. 21. Thus, the relationship between the means for verifying and
the means for receiving is different in this case. Because Petitioner took a position
inconsistent with the position in the Reexam, Petitioner can and has received a
different result than the Reexam.
Upon review of Petitioner’s and Patent Owner’s analysis and supporting
evidence, we are persuaded that Petitioner has not shown by a preponderance of
evidence that claim 1, and claims 2–4, which depend ultimately from claim 1, are
anticipated by Maejima.
E. Claims 1–4 — Obviousness over AMD and Maejima
Petitioner argues that claims 1–4 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)
over AMD and Maejima. Pet. 54–56. Petitioner asserts this challenge because,
inter alia, Patent Owner argued in the Reexam that Maejima lacks a
“predetermined protocol requirement,” as recited by the all the challenged claims.
Id. (citing Ex. 1009, 12–13). As explained above in Section II.C., we have found
that AMD meets this limitation, as well as all other limitations of claims 1–4.
As to motivation to combine AMD and Maejima, Petitioner states:
A person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would
have combined AMD and Maejima because they both pertain to
reducing power consumption in microprocessors by stopping the
clock signal and designs for accomplishing it. First, AMD teaches
specifically that processors may need time to complete housekeeping
tasks before clock signals are stopped, and the recognition and
solution of that problem in AMD would pertain equally to other
references disclosing clock signal stoppage designs.

17

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
Pet. 55–56. Thus, the Petitioner has provided evidence of sufficient
rationale to combine AMD and Maejima. Additionally, we note that the
discussion above in Sections II. B. and II. C. provides further description of
how Petitioner has shown sufficiently that AMD and Maejima meet the
limitations of claims 1–4. Thus, upon review of Petitioner’s and Patent
Owner’s analysis and supporting evidence, we are persuaded that Petitioner
has shown by a preponderance of evidence that claim 1, and claims 2–4,
which depend ultimately from claim 1, would have been obvious over AMD
and Maejima.
III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, we are persuaded that Petitioner has shown
by a preponderance of the evidence that:
1. claims 1–4 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 102 over AMD; and
2. claim 1–4 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over AMD and
Maejima.
We further conclude that Petitioner’s challenges to cancelled claims 5, 6,
and 9 are moot.

18

IPR2014-00563
Patent 5,502,689
IV. ORDER
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that claims 1–4 of U.S. Patent 5,502,689 have been shown to be
unpatentable; and
FURTHER ORDERED that, because this is a Final Written Decision, parties
to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must comply with the
notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
