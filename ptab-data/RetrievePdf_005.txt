DECISION
Denying Institution of Inter Partes Review
37 C.F.R. § 42.108

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
Toyota Motor Corporation (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition (Paper 2,
“Pet.”) to institute inter partes review of claims 1–29 of expired U.S. Patent
No. 5,479,479 (Ex. 1001, “the ’479 patent”). Cellport Systems, Inc. (“Patent
Owner”) filed a Preliminary Response (Paper 6, “Prelim. Resp.”).
Upon consideration of the Petition and Preliminary Response, we are
not persuaded, under 35 U.S.C. § 314(a), that Petitioner has demonstrated a
reasonable likelihood that it would prevail in showing the unpatentability of
any of claims 1–29 of the ’479 patent. Accordingly, we do not institute an
inter partes review of any claim of the ’479 patent.
B. Related Matters
The ’479 patent has been asserted in two lawsuits in the United States
District Court for the District of Colorado. Pet. 3; Paper 4, 2.
C. References Relied Upon
Petitioner relies on the following references:1

Petitioner’s identification of “RS-285” in the grounds of unpatentability
identified in the table above appears to be a typographical error. Patent
Owner has regarded “RS-285” as referring, instead, to RS-485. Hereinafter,
we will state and regard these grounds as based on RS-485, not “RS-285.”

Patent 5,479,479
pertains to sending and receiving digital data between a plurality of
peripheral devices, through a cellular telephone, to remote devices. Id. at
Abstr. One aspect of the ’479 patent concerns providing a universal
interface to different kinds of cellular phones in the form of an adaptor cable
that provides for selectable coding to identify the type of the attached phone,
and the application environment for that aspect of the invention can be that
of a car kit environment. Id. at 2:40–55. Another aspect of the ’479 patent
concerns using a controller attached to a common bus to which a plurality of
peripheral devices also are attached to permit digital data to be
communicated to and from the peripheral devices via a wireless telephone.
Id. at 3:30–44. Figure 15 of the ’479 patent is reproduced below:

5

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
Figure 15 shows cellular phone 10 connected to car kit controller 200
through an interconnect cable having universal connector 45 that connects
with car kit connector 204. Id. at 10–17. Car kit controller 200 includes bus
logic 268 to control common bus 280 to which peripheral devices CD ROM
292, display 288, and GPS Receiver 284 are connected. Id. at 59–61.
With regard to operation of the system, the ’479 patent states:
In operation, cellular phone 10 may receive RF signals
containing data addressed to one of the peripheral devices. The
data is passed via interconnect cable 46 to microprocessor 208.
Microprocessor 208 formats the data according to the needs of
the peripheral device to which the data is addressed. The data
is then either buffered or passed directly through bus connector
276 to the appropriate peripheral device [on] bus 280.
Car kit controller 280 further comprises circuitry to allow
this process to be reversed to allow any of the peripheral
devices to send data through car kit controller 200 and cellular
phone 10 and out of the car using RF signals. Accordingly, a
duplex digital path is provided between bus 280 and cellular
phone 10, for allowing digital information to be transmitted
through car kit controller 200 in either direction.
Id. at 12:39–54.
Claims 1 and 17 are the only independent claims and are reproduced
below. Other challenged claims depend, directly or indirectly from claim 1
or claim 17.

peripheral devices.
Id. at 16:62–17:32, 18:47–19:18 (emphases added).
B. Claim Construction
The ’479 patent is expired. We construe expired patent claims
according to the standard applied by the district courts. See In re Rambus,
694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Specifically, we apply the principles set
forth in Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312–17 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en
banc). “In determining the meaning of the disputed claim limitation, we
look principally to the intrinsic evidence of record, examining the claim
language itself, the written description, and the prosecution history, if in
evidence.” DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 469 F.3d
1005, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312–17).
The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary
meaning, and that is the meaning the term would have to a person of
ordinary skill at the time of the invention, in the context of the entire patent
including the specification. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312–1313. Claims
are not interpreted in a vacuum but are a part of and read in light of the
specification. See Slimfold Mfg. Co. v. Kinkead Indus., Inc., 810 F.2d 1113,
1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Although it is improper to read a limitation from the
specification into the claims, the claims still must be read in view of the
specification of which they are a part. See Microsoft Corp. v. Multi-Tech
Sys., Inc., 357 F.3d 1340, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
“first means for interconnecting said
circuitry with said peripheral device controller”
Claim 17 recites: “first means for interconnecting said circuitry with
said peripheral device controller.” The phrase includes the word “means.”
Thus, the phrase presumptively is a means-plus-function element under
35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6,6 and is construed to cover the corresponding
structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents
thereof. Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC, 2015 WL 3687459, at *9 (en
banc) (Fed. Cir. June 16, 2015). First, we identify the recited function
performed by this means-plus-function element. It is “interconnecting said
circuitry with said peripheral device controller.” The corresponding
structure in the Specification of the ’479 patent is the interconnect cable
shown in Figures 14 and 15, together with connector 48 at one end
configured to attach to particular circuitry and universal connector 45 for
attaching to parts having different connecting configurations. Ex. 1001,
6:36–40, 7:15–20, 9:59–61, 10:10–18. Each of the disclosed embodiments
in the ’479 patent includes the universal connector. We determine that the
corresponding structure for this means is a cable with a connector at each of
two ends, one of the two connectors being a universal connector having a
structure as described in the Specification of the ’479 patent, such as that
6

Paragraphs 1 through 6 of § 112 was replaced with §§ 112(a) through
112(f) when § 4(c) of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. No.
112–29, 125 Stat. 284, 329 (2011)(“AIA”) took effect on September 16,
2012. Because the patent application resulting in the ’479 patent was filed
before the effective date of the AIA, we will refer to the pre-AIA version of
35 U.S.C. § 112.
10

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
shown in Figure 9. A more specific construction is not necessary for this
decision.
“processing means”
Claim 17 recites that said peripheral device controller includes
“processing means.” The term “processing means” includes the word
“means.” Thus, the term presumptively is a means-plus-function limitation
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, and is construed to cover the
corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the Specification and
equivalents thereof. Patent Owner asserts that there is no recited function
for this element. Prelim. Resp. 10. We disagree. The function recited is
“processing.” Although the recited function is broad, it nevertheless is a
recited function. Because the function recited is broad, however, the
corresponding structure described in the Specification is not limited to
microprocessor 208 shown in Figures 14 and 15, but also includes
identification logic 224. The Specification describes:
When cellular phone 10 is initially connected to car kit
controller 200, identification logic 224 samples the pins of
universal connector 45 through car kit connector 204 in order to
determine the model of cellular phone 10. Two processes for
determining the model of cellular phone 10 through sampling of
universal connector 45 are detailed above with respect to FIGS.
7 and 8. Upon sampling of the pins of universal connector 45,
identification logic 224 receives coded information, regarding
the model of cellular phone 10, which it provides to
microprocessor 208. Microprocessor 208 then performs a table
look-up of data stored in non-volatile memory 212.
Ex. 1001, 10:18–30. Identification logic 224, together with

11

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
microprocessor 208, performs the recited “processing.” Therefore, we
determine that the corresponding structure for this means includes
identification logic, such as identification logic 224 shown in Figure
14 and 15.
“circuitry contained in a housing for receiving
and transmitting signals carried through an air link”
Claim 17 recites “circuitry contained in a housing for receiving and
transmitting signals carried through an air link.” This phrase does not
include the word “means.” Thus, the phrase presumptively is not a meansplus-function limitation under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6. Williamson,
2015 WL at *6. However, that presumption can be overcome, such as when
the phrase does not recite sufficiently definite structure. Id. at *7. That is
the case here.
First, we note that, as recited, the housing is not a part of the circuitry.
It is the generic “circuitry” that is for receiving and transmitting signals
carried through an air link. The Specification does not provide a definition
for the word “circuitry.” The word “circuitry,” however, is so broad that it
does not convey any definite structure. See MCGRAW-HILL DICTIONARY OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TERMS, 355, 615 (4th ed. 1989 ) (Defining
“circuitry” as “[t]he complete combination of circuits used in an electrical
and electronic system or piece of equipment” and “circuit” or “electric
circuit” as “[a] path or group of interconnected paths capable of carrying
electric current.”) (Ex. 3001). In the field of digital data processing,
virtually everything that performs an operation constitutes circuitry.

12

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
Accordingly, we construe this phrase (exclusive of the words “in a housing”)
as a means-plus-function element under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6. The
function recited is “receiving and transmitting signals carried through an air
link.” The corresponding structure described in the Specification is a
cellular phone or cellular radio telephone. Ex. 1001, Figs. 14, 15, 8:35,
9:59–61, 10:10–16.
C. Alleged Obviousness of Claims 1, 2, 4, 6–19, 21–25,
and 27–29 over Boatwright, RS-485, and Mansell
Boatwright
Boatwright discloses peripheral devices and data terminals on a
vehicle, which are coupled together in a local area network, in which access
to the peripheral devices and data terminals are provided through a common
bus. Ex. 1002, Abstr. In a preferred embodiment, the vehicle is a forklift
truck, and a portable data terminal and a set of peripheral devices are
arranged on the vehicle and connected via a local area network. Id. at 3:46–
49. Figure 1 of Boatwright is reproduced below:

13

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479

Figure 1 shows an onboard system including portable battery operated
data terminal 10 which may be connected through adapter 11, and peripheral
devices 12 (display), 13 (keyboard), and 14 (printer). Id. at 5:42–44. The
date terminal and the peripheral devices are connected to local area network
data bus 16. Id. at 5:46–47. Adapter 11 releasably accommodates portable
data terminal 10 which receives and stores data obtained by optical bar code
scanner or RF tag scanner 18. Id. at 49–52. Boatwright describes another
embodiment that can employ multiple data terminals 10 connected to
common bus 16. Id. at 6:4–6. Common bus 16 also is connected RS-232
interface means 15. Id. at 8–10. RS-232 interface means 15 effects data
exchange between data terminals and peripheral devices on common bus 16,
and a host computer system overseeing a plurality of vehicles. Id. at 11–13.
14

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
Boatwright describes that a number of data terminals may be coupled to
common bus 16 via adapters and that the multiple terminals can share the
peripheral devices on the vehicle. Id. at 39–44. Boatwright describes that
communication is enabled from terminal to terminal and from any terminal
to RS-232 interface means 15. Id. at 6:8–10.
Figure 4, reproduced below, illustrates a similar embodiment,
specifically for a delivery truck application. Id. at 6:47–49.

Figure 4 illustrates an embodiment suitable for a delivery truck application,
in which peripheral devices 61–67 include engine oil sensor 61, engine
temperature sensor 62, fuel flow meter 63, tachometer 64, odometer 65, and
printer 66. Id. at 6:47–49. In this embodiment, RF coupling means 67, a
15

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
wireless modem, effects communication from the terminals and devices on
the common bus to and from a remote host computer. Id. at 56–62.
Boatwright describes that even the embodiment of Figure 1 may include
such a wireless RF modem. Id. at 6:62–63.
According to Boatwright, for either the embodiment of Figure 1 or
Figure 4, there is a LAN (“local area network”) controller. Id. at 6:19–21,
6:52–56. It is described that the LAN controller can be disposed within any
terminal, RS-232 interface means 15, RF coupling means 67, or even printer
49. Id. at 6:19–21, 6:27–32, 6:44–45, 6:56–62.
Analysis
Claim 1 recites:
said digital information to be received by said first peripheral
device first being received by and outputted from a peripheral
device controller having a processor,
Ex. 1001, 17:5–8.
In that regard, claim 17 similarly recites:
said digital information to be received by said first peripheral
device is first received by and outputted from said peripheral
device controller;
Id. at 18:63–65.
Claim 1 additionally recites:
transferring said second digital information from said second
peripheral device to said peripheral device controller; and
transmitting said second digital information from said circuitry
through the air link to a remote device after receiving said
second digital information by said peripheral device controller.

16

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
Id. at 17:26–32.
As indicated above, each of claims 1 and 17 recites that digital
information to be received by the first peripheral device first be received by
and outputted from the peripheral device controller, and claim 1 further
recites transferring digital information from a second peripheral device to
the peripheral device controller prior to transmitting that digital information
through the air link. For reasons discussed below, Petitioner’s accounting of
these limitations of claim 1 and claim 17 as satisfied by Boatwright is
deficient.
First, with regard to receiving signals via an air link and obtaining
digital information from the signals, Petitioner’s analysis with regard to
claim 1 (Pet. 17) mixes RF coupling means 67 with the network controller
which may be contained within RF coupling means 67. Although RF
coupling means 67 receives signals and outputs digital information, the
network controller contained within RF coupling means 67 does not
necessarily take part in that activity. The same deficiency exists for
Petitioner’s analysis with regard to claim 17. See Pet. 34–35. All activities
of RF coupling means 67 are not automatically attributable to the network
controller contained in RF coupling means 67. For instance, RF coupling
means 67 may include a protocol converter, similar to RS-232 components
15 and 37. Ex. 1002, 6:19–21.
Second, with regard to claim 1’s requirement of the peripheral device
controller first receiving information that is intended for a peripheral device,
Petitioner cites to Boatwright, for this disclosure: “The network controller
[within RF coupling means 67] . . . may contain a special buffer memory for
17

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
storing data for one or more terminals . . . .” Pet. 17 (citing Ex. 1002, 7:1–
3). With regard to the similar requirement in claim 17, Petitioner does the
same by referring to its argument in the context of claim 1. Id. at 35.
The cited text is taken out of context. The entire sentence reads:
“The network controller when separate from the terminal may contain a
special buffer memory for storing data for one or more terminals which may
be temporarily disconnected from the network.” Ex. 1002, 7:1–4.
As discussed above, data terminals in Boatwright are portable and
may be removed from respective adapters that connect to the common bus.
The cited disclosure of Boatwright conveys that, when the terminals are
disconnected from the common bus, the network controller may store the
data that is intended for them. Claim 1, however, recites “a plurality of
peripheral devices communicating with a common bus” (emphasis added).
Claim 17 recites to a common bus that “each peripheral device
communicates with” (emphasis added). Claim 17 further recites “a
peripheral device communicating with each of said plurality of peripheral
devices” (emphasis added). Assuming that Boatwright’s terminal is a
peripheral device, the configuration required by claims 1 and 17 is not met
when the terminal is disconnected from the common bus. Thus, although
the network controller may store information intended for disconnected data
terminals, that is not sufficient to meet the requirement that the information
to be received by the peripheral device is first received by and outputted
from the peripheral device controller. Disconnected terminals are not
communicating with either the common bus or the peripheral device
controller.
18

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
Third, with regard to claim 1’s requirement of transmitting
information to the peripheral controller and thereafter transmitting that
information through the air link, Petitioner’s analysis again mixes RF
coupling means 67 with the network controller which may be contained
within RF coupling means 67. Pet. 19. As noted above, although RF
coupling means 67 receives information, the network controller contained
within RF coupling means 67 does not necessarily receive that same
information prior to transmission of the information over an air link.
Fourth, according to claim 17, the peripheral device controller is a
component separate from the “circuitry” that receives and transmits signals
through an air link, because claim 17 recites: “said peripheral device
controller receiving digital information from said circuitry.” Ex. 1001,
18:58–60 (emphasis added). That also is the configuration for the other
disclosed embodiments in the ’479 patent. In Petitioner’s application of
Boatwright, the peripheral device controller is either RF coupling means 67
or the network controller contained within RF coupling means 67. Pet. 34–
35. In either case, Boatwright’s peripheral device controller would not be a
separate component from the circuitry that receives and transmits signals
through the air link, RF coupling means 67. Consequently, Petitioner has
not adequately accounted for the relationship between the recited circuitry
and peripheral device controller.
Fifth, claim 17 recites “first means for interconnecting said circuitry
with said peripheral device controller.” Ex. 1001, 18:66–67. We have
determined that the corresponding structure for this means is a cable with a
connector at each of two ends, one of the two connectors being a universal
19

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
connector having a structure as described in the Specification of the ’479
patent, such as that shown in Figure 9. Petitioner’s accounting of this
limitation in its claim chart (Pet. 35) is deficient, because Petitioner
identifies neither a cable nor a universal connector, and because Petitioner
does not explain any equivalence between what it has identified and a cable
having on one end thereof a universal connector.
Sixth, claim 17 recites “circuitry contained in a housing for receiving
and transmitting signals carried through an air link.” We have construed this
recitation as a means-plus-function element under 35 U.S.C. § 112,
paragraph 6, and determined that its corresponding structure in the
Specification of the ’479 patent is a cellular phone or cellular radio
telephone. Petitioner fails to show, sufficiently, that Boatwright’s RF
coupling means 67, shown as RF modem 67 in Figure 4 of Boatwright, is the
same as or equivalent to a cellular phone or a cellular radio telephone.
Finally, claim 17 recites “processing means.” As discussed above, we
have determined that the corresponding structure for this means includes
identification logic such as identification logic 224 shown in Figures 14 and
15 of the ’479 patent. Petitioner has not accounted for this identification
logic when reading claim 17 onto the disclosure of Boatwright.
Petitioner’s reliance on RS-485 and Mansell do not make up for the
above-noted deficiencies in claims 1 and 17. Moreover, claims 2, 4, 6–16,
18, 19, 21–25, and 27–29 depend, directly or indirectly, from claim 1 or
claim 17 and Petitioner’s challenges to these claims suffer from the same
deficiencies as the challenges to claims 1 and 17. For the foregoing
reasons, Petitioner has not shown a reasonable likelihood that it would
20

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
prevail in establishing that any of claims 1, 2, 4, 6–19, 21–25, and 27–29
would have been obvious over Boatwright, RS-485, and Mansell.
D. Alleged Obviousness of Claims 3 and 5
over Boatwright, RS-485, Mansell, and Hotto
Claim 3 depends from claim 2 which depends from claim 1. Claim 5
depends from claim 1. Petitioner relies on Hotto to account for the
respective features added by these dependent claims relative to the claims on
which they depend. Petitioner’s reliance on Hotto, however, does not cure
the deficiencies discussed above with regard to the disclosure of Boatwright.
Accordingly, Petitioner has not shown a reasonable likelihood that it
would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of any of claims 3 and 5 as
unpatentable over Boatwright, RS-485, Mansell, and Hotto.
E. Alleged Obviousness of Claim 20
over Boatwright, RS-485, Mansell, and Guy
Claim 20 depends from claim 19, which depends from claim 18,
which depends from claim 17. Petitioner relies on Guy to account for the
features added by claim 20 relative to the subject matter of claim 19.
Petitioner’s reliance on Guy does not cure the deficiencies discussed above
with regard to the disclosures of Boatwright.
Accordingly, Petitioner has not shown a reasonable likelihood that it
would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of claim 20 as unpatentable
over Boatwright, RS-485, Mansell, and Guy.

Patent 5,479,479
F. Alleged Obviousness of Claim 26 over
Boatwright, RS-485, Mansell, and Thompson
Claim 26 depends from claim 25, which depends from claim 17.
Petitioner relies on Thompson to account for the features added by claim 26
relative to the subject matter of claim 25. As noted above with respect to
Petitioner’s reliance on Hotto, Petitioner’s reliance on Thompson also does
not cure the deficiencies discussed above with regard to the disclosure of
Boatwright.
Accordingly, Petitioner has not shown a reasonable likelihood that it
would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of claim 26 as unpatentable
over Boatwright, RS-485, Mansell, and Thompson.
G. Alleged Obviousness of Claims 1, 2, 4, 6–12,
15–19, 22–24, and 27–29 over Mansell and RS-485
Mansell
Mansell discloses a vehicle monitoring system including a mobile
unit. Ex. 1014, 2:55–56. The mobile unit onboard a vehicle includes an
input unit which is responsive to an event or condition associated with the
vehicle, and which serves to provide information describing the event or
condition. Id. at 2:57–60. The mobile unit also has a GPS receiver that is
responsive to navigation signals transmitted by a satellite navigation system,
and which provides information describing the vehicle’s location based on
the navigation signals. Id. at 60–64. The mobile unit further includes a
mobile unit controller including a cellular telephone transmitter for
transmitting information onto a cellular telephone communications link. Id.
at 64–68. Information transmitted on the cellular link includes that which
22

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
describes a vehicle event or condition, and information describing the
vehicle’s location. Id. at 3:1–7. Mansell’s Figures A and 2B are reproduced
below, in side-by-side manner:

Figures 2A and 2B collectively illustrate mobile unit 100 and mobile unit
controller 200. Mobile unit 100 includes alarm system 370, connected to
“trunk lid open” sensor 374, “hood open” sensor 376, and “glass breakage”
sensor 378. Id. at 11:15–22. An alarm signal would be provided from alarm
system 370 to microcomputer 202 in mobile unit controller 200. Id. at
12:48–52. Mobile unit 100 includes GPS receiver 314 and auxiliary position
determining unit 390. The auxiliary position determining unit is connected
to gyroscope 391, accelerometer 393, compass 394, and differential wheel
rotation sensor 392, and may calculate the present location of the vehicle by

23

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
using dead reckoning or other conventional extrapolation algorithms. Id. at
9:54–66. Keypad 340 is provided in mobile unit 100, to serve as a human
interface. Id. at 10:43–44. Mobile unit controller 200 is connected to
transceiver 316, which is connected to cellular telephone antenna 316A. Id.
at 10:25–27.
RS-485
RS-485 is titled: “Standard for Electrical Characteristics of
Generators and Receivers for use in Balanced Multipoint Systems.” Ex.
1011, 1. The lead paragraph in the “Scope” section of RS-485 reads as
follows:
This standard specifies the electrical characteristics of
generators and receivers that may be employed when specified
for the interchange of binary signals in multipoint
interconnection of digital equipment. When implemented
within the guideline of this standard, multiple generators and
receivers may be attached to a common interconnecting cable.
Ex. 1011, 6. The last paragraph in the “Scope” section of RS-485 reads:
Any devices which are represented as complying with limits
established by this standard shall meet the applicable
specifications within the ranges of those factors which are
described as appropriate for the operation of the equipment;
such as power supply voltages, ambient temperature, and
humidity.
Id. Thus, RS-485 provides the characteristics of various electrical
parameters, including their limits, for generators and receivers that may be
attached to a common line.

Patent 5,479,479
Analysis
In claim 1, the plurality of peripheral devices are referred to as
“communicating with a common bus.” Ex. 1001, 16:63–64. Claim 17
similarly recites that each of the plurality of peripheral devices
“communicates with” a “common bus.” Id. at 19:3–5. Petitioner
acknowledges that, in Mansell, the disclosed peripheral devices do not
communicate with each other. Ex. 1014, 45. As shown above in Figures 2A
and 2B, each of the keypad, alarm system, GPS receiver, auxiliary position
determining unit, etc., has its own input path to microcomputer 202 of
mobile unit controller 200.
Petitioner’s argument regarding the “common bus” is this:
Although Mansell does not expressly disclose that all
peripherals can communicate with each other, it would have
been obvious to combine Mansell with the RS-485 bus
protocol, which teaches this limitations. Indeed, Mansell
discloses that an RS-485 compatible bus is preferred at least for
communication with the keypad. Id. at 13:27–31. It therefore
would have been obvious to program all peripheral devices to
communicate with each other via an RS-485 bus since doing so
would have simplified the need for alternate communication
protocols for devices other than the keypad.
As explained above, RS-485 provides a multidrop bus
where “[a]ny of the slave devices on an RS-485 bus can
communicate with any other [of] 32 slave devices without
going through a master device.” Ex. 1018. RS-485 is
described as a “simple hardware bus.” Ex. 1019, U.S. Patent
No. 5,274,311 to Littlejohn at Abstract. RS-485 is also very
well known and relatively easy to implement. See Ex. 1004 at
¶¶ 33–46, 159–97.
Pet. 45.

25

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
We are not persuaded by Petitioner’s argument, which is misplaced in
several respects. Mansell does not disclose that an RS-485 compatible bus is
preferred for communicating with the keypad, as Petitioner states, in the
sense that other peripheral units are expected to communicate with the
keypad. Instead, Mansell states:
Preferably, line driver 240 employs the RS-485 interface
standard, allowing substantial noise tolerance over the pathway
from the keypad in the passenger compartment to the Mobile
Unit controller in the trunk of the vehicle.
Ex. 1014, 13:27–31 (emphasis added). The above-quoted text concerns only
line driver 240, which is illustrated in Figure 2A. The electrical
characteristics adopted within the driver, according to Mansell, are for
reducing noise and do not change the direct connection between the
keyboard 340 and microcomputer 202 to a common bus also making a
connection to all other peripheral units.
Patent Owner correctly notes that Petitioner’s assertion (Pet. 45) that
“Mansell discloses that an RS-485 compatible bus is preferred at least for
communication with the keypad” is not adequately supported by Mansell.
Prelim. Resp. 41. As is pointed out by Patent Owner, there is no disclosure
in Mansell as to whether the line driver should be connected to a common
bus to which other peripheral devices also are connected; instead, Mansell
only discloses that the internal specifications of the line driver, for noise
reduction purposes, comply with the standard set forth in RS-485. Prelim.
Resp. 37–38. We further agree with the following observation of Patent
Owner:

26

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
Mansell really describes a communication line for the use of
reducing noise between a peripheral device such as a keypad
and the microcomputer. The only reason set forth for using
such an interface is for noise reduction.
Id. at 41. Patent Owner also correctly notes that Petitioner has pointed to no
reason for Mansell’s keypad to receive signals from other devices. Id. at 43.
With regard to RS-485, we have noted above that it sets standards for
electrical characteristics of generators and receivers that may be connected
to a common bus. It neither teaches nor suggests what specific devices
should or should not be connected to a common bus. Thus, the lack of
teaching in Mansell that the peripheral devices are connected to a common
bus is not remedied by Petitioner’s reliance on RS-485. Although the
peripheral devices “may be” or “can be” rearranged to be connected to a
common bus, that does not constitute sufficient rationale to support a
conclusion of obviousness. To support an adequate basis for combining
teachings, there has to be articulated reasoning with rational underpinnings.
In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Petitioner has not
articulated sufficient reasoning with such rational underpinnings.
Citing Exhibit 1018, Petitioner asserts that RS-485 provides a
multidrop bus where “[a]ny of the slave devices on an RS-485 bus can
communicate with any other [of] 32 slave devices without going through a
master device.” Pet. 45. The Declaration of John Villasenor does the same.
Ex. 1004 ¶ 44. Petitioner’s list of Exhibits identify Exhibit 1018 as:
National Instruments, “A Quick Comparison of RS-232, RS422, and RS-485 Serial Communication Interfaces.”

27

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
Pet. iv. The Declaration of John Villasenor refers to Exhibit 1018 as a white
paper from “National Instruments.” Ex. 1004, ¶ 44. Exhibit 1018, as filed
in the Board’s Patent Review Processing System, however, is U.S. Patent
No. 5,334,974, and does not contain the quoted text.
In any event, the quoted text does not help Petitioner’s position
because RS-485 does not contain this text and, as discussed above, RS-485
does not describe which peripheral devices should or should not be
configured on a common bus. Also, as discussed above, Mansell describes
using a particular line driver that meets RS-485 standard, to achieve noise
reduction, rather than to communicate with other peripheral devices.
Mansell does not describe peripheral devices arranged on a common bus.
The quoted text, even assuming that the underlying paper has been
filed by Petitioner to indicate what a RS-485 common bus may do, does not
provide reasoning with rational underpinnings to configure Mansell’s
peripheral devices on a common bus, where Petitioner, as here, articulates
no need or desire, stemming from Mansell, for the peripheral devices to be
communicating with each other. Mansell’s peripheral devices are not
arranged on a common bus and have no identified need to communicate with
each other.
Petitioner’s analysis with respect to claim 17 and the claims
depending therefrom has two additional deficiencies discussed below.
First, claim 17 recites “first means for interconnecting said circuitry
with said peripheral device controller.” Ex. 1001, 18:66–67. We have
determined that the corresponding structure for this means is a cable with a
connector at each of two ends, one of the two connectors being a universal
28

IPR2015-00634
Patent 5,479,479
connector having a structure as described in the specification of the ’479
patent, such as that shown in Figure 9. Petitioner’s accounting of this
limitation in its claim chart (Pet. 55) is deficient, because it identifies neither
a cable nor a universal connector and because it does not explain any
equivalence between what it has identified and a cable having a universal
connector on one end thereof.
Second, claim 17 recites “processing means.” As discussed above, we
have determined that the corresponding structure for this means includes
identification logic such as identification logic 224 shown in Figures 14 and
15 of the ’479 patent. Petitioner has not accounted for this identification
logic when reading claim 17 onto the teachings of Mansell.
For the foregoing reasons, we are not persuaded that Petitioner has
shown a reasonable likelihood that claims 1, 2, 4, 6–12, 15–19, 22–24, and
27–29 are unpatentable, under 35 U.S.C. § 103, over Mansell and RS-485.
III. CONCLUSION
Petitioner has not established a reasonable likelihood that it would
prevail in showing the unpatentability of any of claims 1–29 of the ’479
patent.
IV.
