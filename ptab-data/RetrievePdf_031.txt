Patent 5,659,891
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
Petitioner, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., filed a Petition to institute
an inter partes review of claims 1–5 of U.S. Patent No. 5,659,891 (“the ’891
patent”). Paper 3 (“Pet.”). Patent Owner, Mobile Telecommunications
Technologies, LLC, timely filed a Preliminary Response. Paper 8 (“Prelim.
Resp.”).
We have authority to determine whether to institute an inter partes
review under 35 U.S.C. § 314 and 37 C.F.R. § 42.4(a). Upon consideration
of the evidence in the Petition and the Preliminary Response, we determine
that Petitioner has not established a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on
the claims challenged in the Petition. Accordingly, we do not institute an
inter partes review of any of the challenged claims of the ’891 patent.
B. Additional Proceedings
The ’891 patent is also challenged, currently, by Petitioner in
IPR2015-01726. Petitioner states that the ’891 patent is asserted against
Petitioner in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
Mobile Telecommunications Technologies, LLC v. Samsung Electronics Co.,
Case No. 2:15-CV-183. Pet. 1. Petitioner also notes that the ’891 patent is
asserted against other parties in at least (1) Mobile Telecommunications
Technologies, LLC v. Apple, Inc., Case No. 2:13-CV-258 (“the Apple
lawsuit”); (2) Mobile Telecommunications Technologies, LLC v. Leap
Wireless International, Inc., Case No. 2:13-CV-885 (“the Leap lawsuit”); (3)
Mobile Telecommunications Technologies, LLC v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., Case
No. 2:13-CV-886, (“the T-Mobile lawsuit”); and (4) Mobile

Patent 5,659,891
Telecommunications Technologies, LLC v. AT&T Mobility LLC, Case No.
2:14-CV-897, all in the Eastern District of Texas. Id. at 1–2.
Petitioner states further that the ’891 patent was also challenged in
other inter partes review proceedings, namely Apple Inc. v. Mobile
Telecommunications Technologies, LLC, Case IPR2014-01035 (PTAB filed
June 27, 2014); and T-Mobile USA, Inc. v. Mobile Telecommunications
Technologies, LLC, Case IPR2015-00018 (PTAB filed Oct. 3, 2014).1 Id. at

The ’891 Patent
The ’891 patent (Ex. 1001), titled “Multicarrier Techniques in
Bandlimited Channels,” generally relates to a method for multicarrier
modulation (“MCM”) using geographically co-located transmitters to
achieve a higher frequency transmission capacity within FCC emission mask
limits. The method provides for a plurality of overlapping subchannels
within a single bandlimited channel to provide higher data transmission
capacity for a mobile paging system. Ex. 1001, 2:15–59. The technique
involves transmitting a plurality of paging carriers, in corresponding
overlapping subchannels, from the same location and within the maskdefined bandlimited channel, without bandlimiting each of the individual
subchannels. Id. In this way, with the center frequencies of the plurality of
modulated carriers within the single bandlimited channel, an optimum

IPR2014-01035 and IPR2015-00018 were both terminated pursuant to
settlement agreements between the respective parties. See T-Mobile USA,
Inc. v. Mobile Telecomms. Techs., LLC, Case IPR2015-00018 (PTAB filed
Oct. 3, 2014) (Paper 14); Apple Inc. v. Mobile Telecomms. Techs., LLC,
Case IPR2014-01035 (PTAB filed June 27, 2014) (Paper 21).

transmission capacity is provided and the plurality of carriers may emanate
from the same transmission source, i.e., an antenna. Id.
An annotated version of Figure 3B of the ’891 patent, reproduced
below, depicts two adjacent carriers asymmetrically located within a single,
mask-defined, bandlimited channel.

As depicted by Figure 3B of the ’891 patent, above, two carriers 32a
and 32b are shown operating over two subchannels (no reference number)
within a bandlimiting mask (annotated in yellow) defining the channel. The
subchannels are asymmetrically aligned within the mask resulting in partial
subchannel overlap. Id. at 4:24–30. The center frequencies of the carriers
32a and 32b are shown by the vertical dashed lines, and, concomitant with
the subchannels, carriers 32a and 32b also overlap. According to the ’891
patent, geographic co-location of the transmitters reduces interference
problems between adjacent subcarriers, thus allowing the spacing between
subchannels to be reduced. Id. at 4:12–20. The ’891 patent explains that the
practical implications of such an asymmetrical arrangement are a greater

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
range of operating parameters, essentially because more subchannels can be
fit within the bandlimited mask without undue interference. Id. at 4:36–46.
C. Illustrative Claim
Claims 1, 3, and 5 are independent. Each of dependent claims 2 and 4
depend directly from claims 1 and 3 respectively. Claim 1 illustrates the
claimed subject matter and is reproduced below:
1. A method of operating a plurality of paging carriers in
a single mask-defined, bandlimited channel comprising the
step of transmitting said carriers from the same location with
said carriers having center frequencies within said channel
such that the frequency difference between the center frequency
of the outer most of said carriers and the band edge of the mask
defining said channel is more than half the frequency difference
between the center frequencies of each adjacent carrier.
The Alleged Grounds of Unpatentability
Petitioner contends that the challenged claims are unpatentable on the
following specific grounds.2

Patent 5,659,891

II. CLAIM CONSTRUCTION
A. Legal Standard
The ’891 patent is expired, and “the Board’s review of the claims of
an expired patent is similar to that of a district court’s review.” In re
Rambus, Inc., 694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In this context, claim terms
generally are given their ordinary and customary meaning, as understood by
a person of ordinary skill in the art, at the time of the invention, taking into
consideration the language of the claims, the specification, and the
prosecution history of record because the expired claims are not subject to
amendment. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312–13 (Fed. Cir.
2005) (en banc).
1. Single mask-defined, bandlimited channel
Independent claims 1, 3, and 5 recite a “single mask-defined,
bandlimited channel.” According to Petitioner, the term means: “a channel
confined to a frequency range.” 6 Pet. 5. Petitioner urges that we adopt the
same construction set forth in other IPR decisions construing this term and
as the District Court construed the same term in the T-Mobile lawsuit.
Patent Owner proposes we interpret the term as a “channel confined to a
frequency range and power spectral density mask.” Prelim. Resp. 10.
The ’891 patent indicates that a mask-defined bandlimited channel is
applied where “[t]he FCC requires signals to be confined within emission
limit masks in order to prevent interference caused by signals straying or
spilling into adjacent channels.” Ex. 1001, 1:57–59. In the context of the
6

In the Apple lawsuit, the parties stipulated that a “single mask-defined,
bandlimited channel” means, “a channel confined to a frequency range.”
Ex. 1006, 76.
6

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
’891 patent, a “bandlimited channel” is also where “carriers operating at
different frequencies are fit within a single bandwidth allocation in a manner
consistent with FCC mask requirements.” Id. at 5:15–19. The Specification
thus describes this term essentially as a single range of frequencies in the
frequency band where a spectral power mask limits the frequency range.
We agree with Patent Owner’s position that one of ordinary skill in
the art would have at least a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering,
several years of experience in wireless telecommunications “and would
possess knowledge regarding frequency, amplitude, and masks as used in
telecommunications.” Prelim. Resp. 10. Because one of ordinary skill in
the art understands the concepts and relationship of frequency, channel,
bandwidth and mask, Patent Owner’s claim construction is essentially a
restatement of the plain meaning of the claim language itself. That is, one of
ordinary skill in the art would understand from a reasonable reading of the
claim language on its face that a “bandlimited channel” is a single limited
frequency range, and that a “mask” is the constraint applied to define that
limited frequency range. Petitioner’s claim construction, on the other hand,
states that the channel is “confined,” but that does not sufficiently, in our
view, account for the term “mask-defined,” as it is recited expressly in the
claims. This is consistent with the Specification further explaining that
“carriers operating at different frequencies are fit within a single bandwidth
allocation in a manner consistent with FCC mask requirements.” Ex. 1001,
5:11–19.
Although both parties have proposed claim constructions for this
phrase, on the record before us we are not apprised as to any reason why this
phrase needs to be construed apart from the plain language of the claim.
7

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
Accordingly, we interpret this phrase according to its plain and ordinary
meaning as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the
specification.
2. Plurality of transmitters
Independent claim 5 recites a “plurality of transmitters.” According
to Petitioner, the term means: “at least two transmitters.” Pet. 5. Patent
Owner does not provide a construction.
It is well settled that “‘plurality,’ when used in a claim, refers to two
or more items, absent some indication to the contrary.” Dayco Prods., Inc.
v. Total Containment, Inc., 258 F.3d 1317, 1327-28 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing
York Prods., Inc. v. Cent. Tractor Farm & Family Ctr., 99 F.3d 1568, 1575
(Fed. Cir. 1996)). Thus, for purposes of this Decision, we interpret
“plurality of transmitters” as two or more transmitters.
3. Band edge
Independent claims 1, 3, and 5 recite the limitation, “the band edge,”
without proper antecedent basis. Patent Owner proposes that “the band
edge” means “the innermost frequencies at which the mask requires
attenuation of the signal.” Prelim. Resp. 14. Petitioner contends that “the
band edge” should be construed as “a band edge of the single mask-defined,
bandlimited channel.” Pet. 7.
On its face, in each of claims 1, 3, and 5, the limitation reads in
context “the band edge of the mask defining said channel” (emphasis added),
clearly referring to the mask in the “single mask-defined, bandlimited
channel” limitation. Patent Owner asserts that the edges of a mask are
defined with respect to frequency on the y-axis, not power as shown on the
x-axis, for example in Figures 3B and 4 of the ’891 patent. Prelim. Resp.
8

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
15–17. We agree with this position to an extent, because as we discussed
above, one of ordinary skill in the art would have understood a bandlimited
channel defined by a mask as essentially a single range of frequencies in the
frequency band along the y-axis where a spectral power mask limits the
frequency range. Ex. 1001, 5:15–19.
Our review of the Specification reveals, however, no evidence of the
term “innermost,” or any persuasive description or definition of “band edge”
that portrays the mask having, for instance, innermost and outermost edges.
In the Brief Description of the Drawings, the Specification describes the
graph in Figure 3A as, “a graph depicting two submasks defining two
subchannels in a single, mask-defined bandlimited channel.” Id. at 3:11–12
(emphasis added). In Figure 3A, below, the single mask-defined
bandlimited channel 31 is illustrated by two spaced apart vertical lines (∆y =
0) extending from the frequency (f) (y-axis) with each vertical line joined by
two diagonal lines to a horizontal line (∆x = 0). Id. at 4:24–34.

Because there are no values shown on the x or y axis, Figure 3A in the
’891 patent illustrates, somewhat arbitrarily, the boundaries, or edges, in
9

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
terms of frequency and power of a “single mask-defined bandlimited
channel.”
Keeping Patent Owner’s assertion in mind, i.e. that the band limited
channel is specifically the frequency range along the y-axis, (Prelim. Resp.
15–17), than the vertical lines (∆y = 0) at their intersection with the y-axis
depict the frequency boundaries, or edges, of the single mask defined
bandlimited channel. The Specification of the ’891 patent explains that an
emission mask attenuates the signal at the “band edge”:
The FCC requires signals to be confined within emission limit
masks in order to prevent interference caused by signals
straying or spilling into adjacent channels. FCC masks typically
require the power spectral density of a signal to be attenuated at
least 70 dB at the band edge.
Ex. 1001, 1:57–61 (emphasis added). The Specification depicts an example
of attenuation at 70dB, 10 kHz from the center frequency, in Figure 4,
shown below:

10

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
Figure 4 is a graph of an FCC emissions mask requiring the power
spectral density to be attenuated to at least 70dB within 10 kHz from center
frequency. Id. at 16–18.
From the Specification and the drawings, it is a reasonable reading of
the written description to understand “the band edge” as the vertical lines at
10 kHz either side of the center frequency. What is not clear from the
description, is that “the band edge” is, or includes, the specific frequencies
between 5 and 10 kHz along the diagonal line, such that an “innermost”
frequency, e.g. 5 kHz from center frequency, is the claimed “band edge.”
Patent Owner contends that construing the band edge as, “the
innermost frequencies at which the mask requires attenuation of the signal”
is proper because the Specification states that “the frequency difference
between the center frequency of each carrier and the nearest band edge of
the mask is greater than half the frequency difference between the center
frequencies of the two carriers.” Prelim. Resp. 18 (quoting Ex. 1001, 4:30–
35). We are not persuaded at this point in the proceeding to read such a
limitation from the Specification into the claims. As an initial matter, on
their face, claims 1, 3, and 5 simply recite “the band edge,” not the “nearest
band edge.” Ex. 1001, 6:9, 21, 40–41. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314
(“Quite apart from the written description and the prosecution history, the
claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of
particular claim terms.”). Although understanding the claim language may
be aided by the explanations contained in the written description, it is
important not to import into a claim limitations that are not a part of the
claim. See Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed.
Cir.), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 719 (2014) (“While we read claims in view of
11

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
the specification, of which they are a part, we do not read limitations from
the embodiments in the specification into the claims.”). The Specification
support relied on by Patent Owner is an embodiment relating to
asymmetrically located subchannels as shown for example in Figure 3B. It
is well-settled that a particular embodiment appearing in the written
description may not be read into a claim when the claim language is broader
than the embodiment. SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d
870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004).
Additionally, we consider the Specification to understand how one of
ordinary skill in the art would have interpreted specific claim terms. Phillips
415 F.3d at 1313 (“Importantly, the person of ordinary skill in the art is
deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim
in which the disputed term appears, but in the context of the entire patent,
including the specification.”). The embodiment disclosed in the
Specification of the ’891 patent to which Patent Owner refers does not,
however, describe or define the term “nearest band edge” with any
specificity. The Specification states:
[i]n accordance with this asymmetry, the frequency difference
between the center frequency of each carrier and the nearest
band edge of the mask is greater than half the frequency
difference between the center frequencies of the two carriers
Ex. 1001 4:30–34. We understand this embodiment to define, in the
circumstance of asymmetrically located subchannels, a relative frequency
difference between the center frequency and the nearest band edge. But we
are not persuaded from the context of the description that one of ordinary
skill in the art would have understood that the “nearest band edge” includes
merely frequencies along diagonal lines as shown for example in Figures
12

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
3A, 3B and 4. Indeed, from a plain reading of the Specification and
observing Figure 3B, it is at least as likely from this description that the
“nearest band edge” refers to the vertical line depicting the band edge of the
mask on the left side of Figure 3B, reproduced below, and its relationship to
the center frequency of the left-most carrier 32a, as compared with the
vertical line depicting the band edge of the mask, farther away, on the right
side of Figure 3B.

Figure 3B of the ’891 patent, above, depicts two carriers 32a and 32b
operating over two subchannels (no reference number) within a bandlimited
mask (also no reference number) defining the channel.
Additionally, Patent Owner argues that their asserted construction is
consistent with the District Court’s construction in the Leap lawsuit. Prelim.
Resp. 17–18. We have reviewed the District Court’s Claim Construction
Order (Ex. 1007) in the Leap lawsuit. At this stage of the proceeding,
13

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
however, we recognize that we have not been presented with the same
evidence and arguments presented to the District Court.
Nothing in the intrinsic or extrinsic record proffered by Patent Owner,
at this point in the proceeding, persuades us that “band edge” should be
construed as “innermost band edge” or a “nearest band edge” in accordance
with Patent Owner’s characterization of an embodiment described in the
Specification. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the evidence supports
Patent Owner’s asserted claim construction for the reasons stated above. For
purposes of this Decision, “the band edge” means: “a band edge of the single
mask-defined, bandlimited channel.”
4. Each adjacent carrier
Patent Owner asserts that “each adjacent carrier” should be construed
as “every single carrier, two of which having a common endpoint or border.”
Prelim. Resp. 28–29. Specifically, Patent Owner relies upon the definition
of “adjacent” as meaning “having a common endpoint or border,” from
Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary. Id. (citing Adjacent, MERRIAMWEBSTER, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adjacent).
Petitioner argues that the term should be given its plain and ordinary
meaning. Pet. 8.
Upon review, we disagree with Patent Owner that the meaning of
“adjacent” as used in the ’891 patent is limited to requiring that adjacent
carriers must have a common endpoint or border. When construing claims,
our “focus must begin and remain centered on the language of the claims
themselves, for it is that language that the patentee chose to use ‘to
particularly point[ ] out and distinctly claim[ ] the subject matter which the
patentee regards as his invention.’” Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC v. Intuitive
14

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
Surgical, Inc., 326 F.3d 1215, 1220 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (alterations in original)
(quoting Interactive Gift Express, Inc. v. Compuserve Inc., 256 F.3d 1323,
1331 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). Nowhere in the specification or claims do we find
the phrase “having a common endpoint or border.” Nor have the parties
pointed to any description indicating such a requirement. In the context of
the claims, “adjacent” means simply “next to.” Consulting MerriamWebster’s Online Dictionary from this perspective, we note that “adjacent”
is also defined as “immediately preceding or following.” MERRIAMWEBSTER, http://www.merriam-webster .com/dictionary/adjacent (last
visited Feb. 10, 2016. This dictionary definition aligns with the claim
language and is consistent with use of the term throughout the Specification.
The Specification states that:
Moreover, the carriers need not be symmetrically or
evenly spaced within the mask defining the channel. That is, the
frequency spacings between adjacent carriers, while symmetric
to each other, can be smaller than the frequency spacings
between the band edges of the mask and the nearest respective
carrier. Indeed, carrier spacings may be irregular such that the
carriers are asymmetrically located within the mask without
incurring undue interference.
Ex. 1001, 4:15–23 (emphasis added). We understand in the context of
this disclosure that adjacent carriers (i.e., carriers next to one another) may
have symmetric frequency spacings with respect to one another, or
potentially “irregular” asymmetrical spacing with respect to one another,
within the mask. Id. Whether the carriers are symmetric or asymmetrically
spaced, we find no persuasive intrinsic or extrinsic evidence requiring that
adjacent carriers must have a common endpoint or border as Patent Owner
asserts.
15

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
Consequently, for the purpose of this Decision, we construe the term
“adjacent” in the phrase “each adjacent carrier,” according to its plain and
ordinary meaning in the context of the claims and Specification, to mean
“next to.”
5. Other constructions
We decline to provide explicit constructions for the remaining claim
terms provided by the parties. In the case of “paging carriers,” the
construction is immaterial to our Decision to Institute, as the parties do not
dispute that certain elements are disclosed by the prior art. For the words
“operating” and “transmitter,” we do not consider the proffered
constructions to provide any clarity over the terms themselves.
III. ANALYSIS
We turn now to Petitioner’s asserted grounds of unpatentability to
determine whether Petitioner has met the threshold standard of 35 U.S.C.
§ 314(a).
A. Claims 1–4 – Obviousness over Cimini in view of the ordinary
skill in the art
Petitioner asserts that claims 1–4 would have been obvious over
Cimini. Pet. 11. We determine that Petitioner has not established a
reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its assertion that claims 1–4 are
obvious for the reasons explained below.
1. Overview of Cimini
Cimini is titled “Analysis and Simulation of a Digital Mobile Channel
Using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing,” and relates to
problems associated with multi-path signal propagation in a mobile cellular
system when carrier signals being transmitted to a mobile unit are scattered,
16

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
for example by buildings and other structures. Ex. 1013 § I. Another issue
Cimini explains is co-channel interference in a cellular system caused by
“mobiles simultaneously using the same channel in different locations.” Id.
Cimini proposes to improve mobile cellular systems by providing symbols,
i.e. carriers, that are transmitted simultaneously in parallel, and rather than
being “divided into N nonoverlapping frequency subchannels . . . [a] more
efficient use of bandwidth can be obtained with a parallel system if the
spectra of the individual subchannels are permitted to overlap.” Id.; see also
id. § II. Cimini teaches a modulation scheme using Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (“OFDM”), for N subcarrier frequencies across a
bandwidth ∆f. Cimini explains further with respect to the subcarrier
bandwidth ∆f that:
For orthogonal frequency spacing and strictly band-limited
spectra (bandwidth ∆f) with δ = ½ ∆f = ½ N∆t, β = log 2 M
bits/s/Hz. In reality, however, the spectra overflow this
minimum bandwidth by some factor . . .
Id. § II. A.
In Figure 10, below, Cimini depicts a “[d]ata setup used in
simulations” illustrating subcarrier group 1, subcarrier group 2, and
subcarrier group 3 along with Pilot signals extending across a 7.5 kHz
channel or “data window.” Id. § III. B.

17

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
With respect to Figure 10 above, Cimini describes 86 subcarriers
across 5 kHz with each subcarrier separated by ∆f 58.59 Hz and all within
subcarrier groups 1–3. Id. § III. C. Pilot carriers account for 2 kHz between
the subcarrier groups, and, Cimini further explains that “the design of a
mobile telephone system must also include measures to limit adjacent
channel interference. This is accomplished by leaving 250 Hz gaps at each
end of the band.” Id. § III. B.
2. Discussion
As discussed below, claims 1–4 are asserted to be unpatentable over
Cimini under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
Section 103(a) forbids issuance of a patent when “the differences
between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such
that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said
subject matter pertains.” In Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966),
the Court set out a framework for applying the statutory language of § 103:
Under § 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to
be determined; differences between the prior art and the
claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of
ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this
background, the obviousness or nonobviousness of the
subject matter is determined.
Id. at 17. “While the sequence of these questions might be reordered in any
particular case, the factors continue to define the inquiry that controls.” KSR
Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 407 (2007).
For an inter partes review, under the statute, any petition must
“identif[y] . . . with particularity . . . the grounds on which the challenge to
each claim is based.” 35 U.S.C. § 312(a)(3). Petitioner has the burden of
18

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
proof to establish that it is entitled to the requested relief. Id. § 42.20(c).
The Petition must include a full statement of the reasons for the relief
requested, including a detailed explanation of the significance of the
evidence. Id. § 42.22(a). The Petition must include a statement of the
relevance of the evidence to the challenge raised. 37 C.F.R. § 104(b)(5).
“The Board may exclude or give no weight to the evidence where a party
has failed to state its relevance or to identify specific portions of the
evidence that support the challenge.” Id. “Thus, we will address only the
basis, rationale, and reasoning put forth by the Petitioner in the petition, and
resolve all vagueness and ambiguity in Petitioner’s arguments against the
Petitioner.” Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., Case
CBM2012-00003, slip op. at 10 (PTAB Oct. 25, 2012) (Paper 8). It is
Petitioner’s responsibility “to explain specific evidence that support its
arguments, not the Board’s responsibility to search the record and piece
together what may support Petitioner’s arguments.” Dominion Dealer Sols.,
LLC v. AutoAlert, Inc., Case IPR2013-00225, slip op. at 4 (PTAB Oct. 10,
2013) (Paper 15).
Against this general background, we consider the reference, the level
of ordinary skill in the art, as well as other evidence and arguments on which
Petitioner relies.
a. Claim 1
Petitioner argues that Cimini discloses a plurality of carriers operating
in a “narrow-band digital mobile channel.” Pet. 14–15 (quoting Ex. 1013,
Abstract). Also, Petitioner contends that, although Cimini describes a
mobile cellular network, one of ordinary skill in the art would have known
that a pager was “one of the most well-known devices for operation in a
19

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
‘narrow-band digital mobile channel’” described by Cimini. Id. at 15.
Petitioner further asserts that Cimini discloses a “mask-defined bandlimited
channel” as recited in claim 1 because Cimini “specifies that the spectra is
‘strictly band-limited’ [and] one of ordinary skill in the art would understand
the channel described by Cimini to be mask-defined and bandlimited.” Id. at
13 (quoting Ex. 1013, 3 § II.A) (citing Ex. 1003 ¶ 21). Based on this
disclosure, Petitioner argues essentially that the 7.5 kHz channel shown in
Cimini’s Figure 10, above, is a “mask-defined bandlimited channel.” Id.
Additionally, Petioner’s declarant, Dr. Kakaes, states that one or ordinary
skill “would have at least a B.S. degree in electrical engineering, computer
science, computer engineering, or equivalent education. This person would
also need to have at least two years of experience in the design and
configuration of wireless paging systems, or other two-way wireless
communications systems.” Ex. 1003 ¶ 10.
Patent Owner contends that a person of ordinary skill in the art would
have possessed “a bachelor’s degree in electrical [engineering] or its
equivalent and about four years working in the field of wireless
telecommunications networks and would possess knowledge regarding
frequency, amplitude, and masks as used in telecommunications, or
equivalent education and work experience.” Prelim. Resp. 10. Based on the
level of ordinary skill in the art, upon which the parties essentially agree, we
are persuaded by Patent Owner’s contention that one of ordinary skill at the
time of filing of the application that became the ’891 patent, would have
understood “[a] mask in telecommunications . . . to be an emission mask or
power spectral density mask,” and that “the bandlimited channel is defined
by a single power spectral density mask.” Id. at 10–11.
20

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
Based on the level of ordinary skill in the art, as we turn to address the
scope and content of the prior art, we are not persuaded by Petitioner’s
evidence and analysis that Cimini, as understood by one of ordinary skill in
the art, discloses either expressly or inherently a “mask-defined bandlimited
channel.”
As an initial matter, we are not persuaded that the plain reading of the
phrase used in Cimini, “strictly band-limited spectra,” describes a frequency
spectra “mask” as one of ordinary skill in the art would understand it. The
“mask,” as described in the specification of the ’891 patent, is a specific
requirement that defines frequency attenuation or emission limit
requirements that confines the spectral limits of a signal within a proscribed
bandwidth. See Ex. 1001, 1:56–61, 2:8–9, 4:24–27, Fig. 3A. Cimini, on the
other hand, never discusses, states, or explains any such mask requirement.
In Cimini, the phrase “strictly band-limited spectra” understood in context,
describes orthogonal frequency spacing, i.e. a minimum bandwidth ∆f ,
between carriers, and the relationship of overlapping carrier frequencies,
“[i]n reality, however, the spectra overflow this minimum bandwidth by
some factor α.” Ex. 1013, 3 § II.A. According to Cimini the ∆f = 58.59 Hz
value is the spacing between each of the 86 carriers that permits some carrier
overlap and sufficient transmission efficiency across the three carrier groups.
Id. § III.C.
The Petition points us to the disclosure in Cimini explaining “that the
spectra in which the parallel systems operate are ‘strictly band-limited.’”
Pet. 12 (quoting Ex. 1013, 3 § II.A.). Cimini, for its part, never discusses
how the spectra is band-limited. The Petition does not provide any evidence
or explanation with respect to Cimini that “strictly band-limited” either
21

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
expressly or inherently means that a spectral mask is involved. Indeed, the
fact that Cimini describes carrier overlap in the context of “band-limited
spectra” indicates that the carrier signals are not confined or attenuated by a
mask.
Petitioner turns to its declarant, Dr. Kakaes, for support of its position,
and argues further that one of ordinary skill in the art would have understood
that Cimini teaches a mask-defined channel. Pet. 13 (citing Ex. 1003 ¶ 21).
Dr. Kakaes states that:
[b]ecause Cimini describes this channel as a 7.5 kHz “data
window” (Ex. SAM1013, p. 8, § III(B)) and specifies that the
spectra is “strictly band-limited” (Ex. SAM1013, p. 8, § II(A)),
one of ordinary skill in the art would have understood the
channel described by Cimini to be mask-defined and
bandlimited.
Ex. 1003 ¶ 21. Dr. Kakaes’s testimony cites to the term “data window”
likening this term to “strictly band-limited” and simply concludes that these
terms mean, to one of skill in the art, a “mask.” Dr. Kakaes provides no
further justification, technical explanation or evidence to support the
conclusion that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand a
connection or association between the terms “data window,” “band-limited
spectra,” and “mask.” On this issue, Dr. Kaekes’s bare testimony that a
“data window” is understood as a spectral mask, without more, is entitled to
little weight. Indeed, Dr. Kakaes’s testimony does not define or explain a,
“mask,” at all, but simply states in his Declaration that Cimini describes a
“7.5 kHz mask-defined, bandlimited channel.” See Id. at ¶ 22.
Our review indicates that the term “data window” in Cimini is used
once in the asserted reference as a synonym for “channel.” See Ex. 1013,
§III. B. We are not apprised of any evidence in Cimini itself, or provided
22

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
any cogent explanation or additional evidence from Dr. Kakaes’s testimony,
that a “data window” is a term of art or would be understood by one of
ordinary skill in the art, as a mask. Neither are we persuaded, as discussed
above, by a plain reading of Cimini that “strictly bandlimited” means, or
infers, a mask.
Addressing Cimini’s disclosure of a 7.5 kHz channel as shown in
Figure 10, Patent Owner argues that “a bandlimited spectrum of a channel is
just a set of values or frequencies of the channel and does not read on a
single mask-defined, bandlimited channel.” Prelim. Resp. 39. We agree
with this position to an extent. The Specification of the ’891 patent clearly
explains that “[t]he FCC requires signals to be confined within emission limit
masks in order to prevent interference caused by signals straying or spilling
into adjacent channels.” Ex. 1001, 1:57–59 (emphasis added). Claim 1 does
not recite merely a “bandlimited channel,” but a “mask-defined bandlimited
channel.” The term “mask-defined” cannot be read out of the plain and
ordinary meaning of the claim. See Stumbo v. Eastman Outdoors, Inc., 508
F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (denouncing claim constructions that
render phrases in claims superfluous). Bicon Inc. v. Straumann Co., 441
F.3d 945, 950 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (“claims are interpreted with an eye toward
giving effect to all terms in the claim”). The plain meaning of the claim, on
its face, includes the “mask-defined bandlimited channel” limitation, as it is
the mask that tells the reader specifically how the channel is bandlimited.
We are not persuaded, on the record before us that Petitioner has
provided sufficient evidence showing that it would have been obvious to a
person of ordinary skill in the art that Cimini discloses or teaches a “maskdefined, bandlimited channel” as recited in claim 1. Accordingly, for the
23

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
reasons above, Petitioner has not established a reasonable likelihood of
prevailing on the ground of unpatentability of claim 1 as obvious over
Cimini.
b. Claim 3
Petitioner advances essentially the same arguments for independent
claim 3, as asserted with respect to claim 1. See Pet. 18–21.
For its part, Patent Owner argues that claim 3 is not obvious for the
same reasons as claim 1. See generally Prelim. Resp. 33.
For the reasons provided above, we are not persuaded that Petitioner
has established a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the ground of
unpatentability of independent claim 3 as obvious over Cimini under 35
U.S.C. § 103.
c. Claims 2 and 4
With respect to claims 2 and 4, Petitioner explains that the additional
limitation of subchannel “overlap” recited in those claims is also found in
Cimini. Pet. 17–18, 21–22. Patent Owner asserts that claims 2 and 4 are not
obvious over Cimini because their respective base claims 1 and 3 are not
obvious, and because claims 2 and 4 recite additional features. Prelim.
Resp. 50.
Based upon our analysis, above, we agree with Patent Owner that
dependent claims 2 and 4 have not been shown to be obvious over Cimini,
because claims 1 and 3, from which they depend, have not been shown to be
obvious over Cimini.
B. Claim 5 – Obviousness over Cimini, Raith, and Alakija
Petitioner has not established a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on
its assertion that claim 5 is obvious for the reasons explained below.
24

IPR2015-01727
Patent 5,659,891
Petitioner alleges for substantially the same reasons as for claim 1 that
Cimini “specifies that the spectra is ‘strictly band-limited’, which one of
ordinary skill in the art would understand as being mask-defined.” Pet. 23
(quoting Ex. 1013 § II.A). As discussed, we do not find these arguments
and evidence persuasive, and Petitioner does not explain how Raith nor
Alakija cure this defect with respect to the claimed “mask-defined,
bandlimited channel” recited in claim 5.
Accordingly, based on the record before us, Petitioner has not
established a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the ground of
unpatentability of claim 5 as obvious over Cimini, Raith, and Alakija.
IV.

SUMMARY

For the forgoing reasons, we do not institute inter partes review of the
’891 patent on the alleged grounds of unpatentability.
V. ORDER
After due consideration of the record before us, it is:
ORDERED that the Petition is denied and no trial is instituted.
