DECISION
Denying Institution of Inter Partes Review
37 C.F.R. § 42.108

Case IPR2015-01189
Patent 5,836,013
INTRODUCTION
American Megatrends, Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI
Computer Corp., Giga-Byte Technology Co., Ltd., and G.B.T., Inc.,
(collectively, “Petitioner”) filed a Petition (Paper 6, “Pet.”) to institute an
inter partes review of claims 1–28 of Patent 5,836,013 (“the ’013 Patent”)
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 311 et seq. Patent Owner Kinglite Holdings, Inc.
filed a Preliminary Response (Paper 13, “Prelim. Resp.”) to the Petition.
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 314(a), which provides that an
inter partes review may not be instituted unless the information presented in
the Petition shows “there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would
prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition.”
Upon consideration of the Petition, Patent Owner’s Preliminary Response,
and the evidence of record, we conclude Petitioner has not established a
reasonable likelihood it would prevail with respect to at least one of the
challenged claims. We, therefore, deny the Petition.
Real Parties in Interest
Petitioner names no real parties in interest other than the parties listed
as Petitioner.

THE ’013 Patent (Ex. 1001)
Described Invention
The ’013 Patent describes chipset (platform)-independent methods for
compressing and decompressing system ROM code of a computer (e.g.,
BIOS, setup program, and one or more option ROMs). Ex. 1001, Abstract.
Compressing takes into account chipset particulars needed for reading to and
writing from registers associated with a particular chipset by appending
computer specific information (e.g., from a shadow RAM table) to the
uncompressed ROM file before compressing portions of it. Id.
Illustrative Claim
Claim 1 of the ’013 Patent below is illustrative of the challenged
claims:
3

Case IPR2015-01189
Patent 5,836,013
1. In a computer having a processor and storage, a
computer-implemented method for generating a system read
only memory (ROM) computer file that can access the ROM of
a target computer, the method comprising the steps of:
receiving, for processing by the processor, a system
ROM computer file comprising a non-compressible
portion and one or more compressible portions,
including a setup program and one or more option
ROM images,
the non-compressible portion comprising a
decompression program;
appending, to the non-compressible portion, information
on accessing the ROM of a target computer;
compressing, via the processor, each compressible
portion to generate compressed data;
generating, via the processor, a compressed system ROM
computer file comprising the compressed data and the
appended non-compressible portion; and
storing the compressed system ROM computer file in the
storage.
PETITIONER’S CHALLENGES
Petitioner contends that claims 10–13, 18, and 20 are unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. § 102 as anticipated by Kikinis CIP;1 and that claims 1–9,
14–17, 19, and 21–28 are obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103 based on Kikinis
CIP, Research Disclosure,2 and Begur.3 Pet. 14. Petitioner’s challenges rely
upon the testimony of Gabriele Sartori, Ph.D. Ex. 1014. Pet. 13.
KIKINIS CIP AS PRIOR ART
All of Petitioner’s challenges rely on Kikinis CIP. Pet. 25–31 and 47–

Patent 5,836,013
59.
The following is an image of a portion of the first page of Kikinis CIP
specifying its “related U.S. Application Data.”

Petitioner contends that although U.S. Application 09/785,574 (“ the
’574 Application”) resulting in issuance of Kikinis CIP was filed after the
critical date (August 11, 1994) of the ’013 Patent, the effective date of
Kikinis CIP reaches back in time to before the ’013 Patent critical date
through a priority claim to abandoned U.S. Patent Application 08/019,592
(“the ’592 application”) which was filed on February 19, 1993. Pet. 14.
Petitioner argues that: 1) “the Kikinis CIP [which] restates the salient
description of the compressed BIOS of the [’592] application” (id.); 2)
“Kikinis et al. applied for substantially the same invention years before the
filing of the application of the [’]013 Patent” (id. at 16); and 3) the “Kikinis
CIP issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,523,079 (Ex. 1005, which incorporates the
entirety of the Kikinis Application [(referring to the ’592 application)] by
reference).” Id. at 17. Petitioner argues “how similar the conceptions of the
[’]013 Patent and [the Kikinis (’592) application] are” by comparing claim
12 of the ’592 application with claim 10 of the ’013 Patent. Pet. 18–19.
Patent Owner contends that Kikinis CIP is not prior art against the
challenged claims because the ’592 application went abandoned on June 18,
1997 (Ex. 1010, 3), well before the filing (February 15, 2001) of the ’574
application. Further, Patent Owner argues that there is no “incorporation by
5

Case IPR2015-01189
Patent 5,836,013
reference” into the ’574 application. Prelim. Resp. 7.
We have reviewed Kikinis CIP and find that although there may be
subject matter in it that also appears in the ’592 application, we do not find
an explicit “incorporation by reference” of the ’592 application.
Furthermore, Patent Owner is correct that the ’592 application went
abandoned well before the filing of the ’574 application. Thus, there is no
direct continuity between the ’592 application and the ’574 application.
We note from the “Related U.S. Application Data,” above that Kikinis
CIP also recites that the ’574 application is a continuation of application
08/683,567 (“the ’567 application”) which, in turn, is a continuation-in-part
of the ’592 application. However, there is no evidence presented in this
record concerning the subject matter of the ’567 application. Petitioner has
not traced the subject matter relied upon from the ’592 application through
the ’567 application. Given that the ’567 application is a continuation-inpart of the ’592 application, we make no assumption regarding the extent of
any common subject matter between them.
Accordingly, Petitioner has not established that Kikinis CIP is entitled
to the benefit of the ’592 application.
CONCLUSION
For the subject matter of Kikinis CIP on which Petitioner relies,
Petitioner has not established a priority date prior to the critical date of the
’013 Patent. All of Petitioner’s challenges rely upon Kikinis. We therefore
determine that the Petition does not establish a reasonable likelihood that
Petitioner would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of claims 1–28
under 35 U.S.C. § 102 or § 103 based on Kikinis CIP alone and in
combination.

above and no trial is instituted.
