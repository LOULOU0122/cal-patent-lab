Patent 5,714,927 B1
I.

INTRODUCTION

Petitioner, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., filed a Petition
requesting an inter partes review of claims 1, 2, and 6 of U.S. Patent No.
5,714,927 B1 (Ex. 1001, “the ’927 patent”). Paper 2 (“Pet.”). In response,
Patent Owner, Signal IP, Inc., filed a Preliminary Response. Paper 5
(“Prelim. Resp.”). We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 314, which
provides that an inter partes review may not be instituted “unless . . . the
information presented in the petition . . . shows that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least 1 of the
claims challenged in the petition.”
For the reasons set forth below, we deny institution of inter partes
review of the ’927 patent.
A. Related Matters
Petitioner indicates that the ’927 patent also has been asserted in the
following proceedings: Signal IP, Inc. v. Ford Motor Company, No. 2-14cv-13729 (E.D. Mich.); Signal IP, Inc. v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC et al.,

B. The ’927 Patent
The ’927 patent relates to side detection vehicle radar systems that
control an alarm or alert indicator to increase the perceived coverage of a
vehicle’s blind spot. Ex. 1001, 1:7–10. Figure 4 of the ’927 patent is
reproduced below.

As illustrated in Figure 4 of the ’927 patent, the radar system on the
host vehicle 50 extends the perceived coverage of the vehicle’s blind spots
54, 62 by zone extensions 56, 64. Id. at 4:7–21. The system prevents or
minimizes radar signal dropouts due to signal flickers in order to improve
the zone of coverage in a vehicle side radar detection system and minimizes
3

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
annoying alert activity when passing stationary or slow moving targets. Id.
at 2:10–15. The time of alert signal activation is measured and compared to
a threshold time. Id. at 2:16–17. When the alert time is greater than or
equal to the threshold time, a longer sustain time is applied to hold the alert
signal on, which bridges the dropout periods due to low radar signal
reflectivity. Id. at 2:25–28.
C. Illustrative Claim
Claim 1 is the only independent claim challenged. Claims 2 and 6
depend from claim 1. Claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative.
1.
In a radar system wherein a host vehicle uses radar to
detect a target vehicle in a blind spot of the host vehicle driver,
a method of improving the perceived zone of coverage response
of automotive radar comprising the steps of:
determining the relative speed of the host and target
vehicles;
selecting a variable sustain time as a function of relative
vehicle speed;
detecting target vehicle presence and producing an alert
command;
activating an alert signal in response to the alert
command;
at the end of the alert command, determining whether the
alert signal was active for a threshold time; and
if the alert signal was active for the threshold time,
sustaining the alert signal for the variable sustain time, wherein
the zone of coverage appears to increase according to the
variable sustain time.
Ex. 1001, 5:28–6:2.

ANALYSIS

A. Claim Construction
In an inter partes review, claim terms in an unexpired patent are given
their broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the
patent in which they appear. 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b); see also In re Cuozzo
Speed Techs., LLC, No. 2014-1301, 2015 WL 4097949, at *7, 8 (Fed. Cir.
2015) (“Congress implicitly approved the broadest reasonable interpretation
standard in enacting the AIA,” and “the standard was properly adopted by
PTO regulation.”). Under the broadest reasonable interpretation standard,
claim terms are given their ordinary and customary meaning as would be
understood by one of ordinary skill in the art in the context of the entire

Petitioner asserts that Bernhard GB “provides substantially the same
teachings as Bernhard” and that the Petition includes parallel citations to
Bernhard GB. Pet. 8 n.1. For purposes of this Decision, citations herein are
to Bernhard only.

Patent 5,714,927 B1
disclosure. In re Translogic Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249, 1257 (Fed. Cir.
2007).
Although the parties do not propose constructions for any specific
claim terms, we determine that it is necessary to construe the distinction, if
any, between “alert command” and “alert signal” recited in claim 1.
Although the doctrine of claim differentiation creates a presumption that
“alert command” and “alert signal” are different in scope, this presumption
can be overcome by written description or prosecution history. See
Seachange Int’l, Inc. v. C-Cor Inc., 413 F.3d 1361, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
In this case, the Specification of the ’927 patent refers to “alert commands”
as element 42 in Figure 3c and “alert signal” as element 46 in Figure 3d. Ex.
1001, 3:57–4:7. Figures 3c and 3d of the ’927 patent are reproduced below.

Figure 3c of the ’927 patent depicts the alert commands 42 as raw alert data.
The Specification of the ’927 patent further describes the relationship
between alert commands and alert signals as follows:
Generally most or all of the gaps 44 [from the alert commands
42] are removed and any remaining gaps 44 are minimized by
this method which is especially successful at higher relative
speeds where the target discrimination algorithm is most
effective. At the same time, because of the sustaining effect,
the sustained alert signal 46 is longer by a period 48 than the
alert command, thereby extending the zone of coverage as
perceived by the driver.
Ex. 1001, 3:67–4:7.
6

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
Without a sustaining action the visual or audio alert signal will
mimic the alert commands 42.
Id. at 3:61–62 (emphasis added).
Accordingly, we construe “alert command” as raw alert data that is
used to generate an “alert signal” and we construe “alert signal” as a signal
that provides a visual or audio alert to a driver.
B. Principles of Law
A patent claim is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) if the
differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art are such that
the subject matter, as a whole, would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said
subject matter pertains. KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406
(2007). The question of obviousness is resolved on the basis of underlying
factual determinations including: (1) the scope and content of the prior art;
(2) any differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art;
(3) the level of ordinary skill in the art; and (4) objective evidence of
nonobviousness. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17–18 (1966).
In that regard, an obviousness analysis “need not seek out precise
teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for
a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of
ordinary skill in the art would employ.” KSR, 550 U.S. at 418; see also
Translogic, 504 F.3d at 1259. A prima facie case of obviousness is
established when the prior art itself would appear to have suggested the
claimed subject matter to a person of ordinary skill in the art. In re Rinehart,
531 F.2d 1048, 1051 (CCPA 1976).
7

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
The level of ordinary skill in the art is reflected by the prior art of
record. See Okajima v. Bourdeau, 261 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001);
In re GPAC Inc., 57 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1995); In re Oelrich,
579 F.2d 86, 91 (CCPA 1978).
C. Claims 1, 2, and 6 Challenge Based on Prior Art
Petitioner asserts that claims 1, 2, and 6 are unpatentable under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious over the combination of Bernhard, Pakett, and
Fujiki. Pet. 8. To support its contentions, Petitioner provides detailed
explanations as to how the prior art meets each claim limitation. Id. at 8–39.
Petitioner also relies upon a Declaration of Dr. David M. Bevly, who has
been retained as an expert witness by Petitioner for the instant proceeding.
Ex. 1002.
1. Bernhard (Exs. 1003 and 1004)
Bernhard, titled “Method for Providing Guiding Assistance for
Vehicle Changing Lane,” describes assisting a motor vehicle when changing
from a current lane to an adjacent lane. Ex. 1003, Abstract. Figure 7 of
Bernhard is reproduced below.

As shown in Figure 7 of Bernhard, the radar system VR of the vehicle
detects the current traffic situation and the system determines a simulation in
8

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
advance to decide if a lane change is possible. Id. at 6:51–55. Detecting the
current traffic situation includes calculating and measuring the distance and
speed of other vehicles. Id. at 6:55–7:42. If all the measured distances are
greater than the calculated safety distances, a possible lane change is
signaled. Id. at Abstract.
2. Pakett (Ex. 1005)
Pakett, titled “Smart Blind Spot Sensor,” describes sensing the
presence of obstacles in a vehicle’s blind spots and generating an indicator
signal notifying the vehicle operator of the presence of the obstacle. Ex.
1005, Abstract. The indicator may be an illuminated indicator or an audible
indicator. Id. A “persistence period” is the amount of time it takes the
vehicle with the mounted radar system to travel 15 feet. Id. at 6:43–46.
When an obstacle is first detected, CPU 31 waits throughout the persistence
period before responding, such that, during the persistence period, no
warnings are sent to the driver indicators. Id. at 6:46–51. After the
persistence period, a warning is sent to the driver indicators. Id. at 6:51–55.
3. Fujiki (Ex. 1006)
Fujiki, titled “Logic Circuit for an Automatic Braking System for a
Vehicle,” describes prolonging vehicle braking for a time or a distance. Ex.
1006, Abstract. The braking is prolonged to overcome multiple reflections
of a radar signal that falsely indicates momentary “safe” signals. Id. Figure
8 of Fujiki is reproduced below.

9

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1

As illustrated in the flow chart of Figure 8 above, if the equations in stage 1
are satisfied, then the program goes to stage 2 to activate the braking system
and return to START. Ex. 1006, 5:49–55. When the equations are no
longer satisfied, the program proceeds to stage 3 and a determination is
made whether the brake system has just been activated. Id. at 5:55–57. If
the brake is on, the program proceeds to stage 4 where the braking system is
further activated for an additional time. Id. at 57–67.
4. Claim 1
Claim 1 recites “at the end of the alert command, determining whether
the alert signal was active for a threshold time.” As discussed in Section
II.A., supra, we construe “alert command” as raw alert data that is used to
generate an alert signal and “alert signal” as a visual or audio alert signal.
Petitioner alleges that Pakett and Fujiki teach the limitation “at the end of the
alert command, determining whether the alert signal was active for a
threshold time.” We are not persuaded that either Pakett or Fujiki teach or
suggest this limitation as properly construed.
The cited portions of Pakett relied upon by Petitioner teach that a
sample and hold circuit 23 outputs a signal to a low pass filter 27 that
10

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
removes high-frequency components. Pet. 20–21, 32; Ex. 1002 ¶ 14; Ex.
1005, 5:14–31. Further, the cited portions of Pakett relied upon by
Petitioner teach that the low pass filter 27 then outputs a signal to a square
wave generator 29 that generates a square wave transition when an obstacle
has been detected, which Petitioner maps to the limitation “at the end of the
alert command, determining whether the alert signal was active for a
threshold time” as recited in claim 1. Pet. 20–21, 32; Ex. 1002 ¶ 14; Ex.
1005, 5:14–31; 5:37–39. We are not persuaded that Pakett’s sample and
hold circuit 23, low pass filter 27, and square wave generator 29 teach or
suggest “at the end of the alert command, determining whether the alert
signal was active for a threshold time” (emphasis added).
Petitioner additionally relies on another section of Pakett to map to the
aforementioned limitation. Pet. 32–33. Specifically, the cited portions of
Pakett relied upon by Petitioner teach when an obstacle is detected, a CPU
34 waits a persistence period before responding to additional transitions,
which Petitioner maps to the limitation “at the end of the alert command,
determining whether the alert signal was active for a threshold time” as
recited in claim 1. Pet. 32–33; Ex. 1002, ¶ 13; Ex. 1005, 6:43–56. We are
not persuaded the cited portion of Pakett teaches or suggests “at the end of
the alert command, determining whether the alert signal was active for a
threshold time” (emphasis added) because Pakett states “[d]uring the
persistence period, no warnings are sent to the driver indicators” (emphasis
added). Ex. 1005, 6:43–56. Pakett merely teaches alert commands (e.g.,
raw alert data that is used to generate an alert signal as construed in Section
II.A., supra) being active during the persistence period because Pakett
11

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
teaches an alert signal (e.g., a visual or audio alert signal as construed in
Section II.A., supra) cannot be active during the persistence period. Id.
Petitioner also relies on Fujiki for teaching the limitation “at the end
of the alert command, determining whether the alert signal was active for a
threshold time” as recited in claim 1. The cited portions of Fujiki relied
upon by Petitioner teach if the equations in stage 1 are satisfied, then the
program goes to stage 2 and the braking system is activated and returns to
START until the equations at stage 2 are no longer satisfied. Pet. 33; Ex.
1006, 5:49–55. When the equations at stage 2 are no longer satisfied, the
program proceeds to stage 3, and a determination is made whether the brake
system has just been activated. Petitioner maps this teaching to the
limitation “at the end of the alert command, determining whether the alert
signal was active for a threshold time” as recited in claim 1. Pet. 33; Ex.
1006, 5:55–57. We are not persuaded that determining whether a brake
system has been activated, as disclosed in Fujiki, teaches or suggests “at the
end of the alert command, determining whether the alert signal was active
for a threshold time” as recited in claim 1 (emphasis added).
5. The Combination of Bernhard, Pakett, and Fujiki
Petitioner contends that the combination of Bernhard, Pakett, and
Fujiki teaches all of the limitations of claims 1, 2, and 6 rendering the claims
unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). Pet. 16–37. Petitioner argues “it
was well known at the time the ’927 patent was filed to combine the features
of the object detection systems of Pakett and Fujiki with the object detection
systems used in Bernhard” for the following reasons:
12

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
[E]ach of Bernhard, Pakett, and Fujiki describe radar systems
for detecting obstacles in the vicinity of a vehicle, and
controlling warning systems to alert the driver to the presence
of the detected obstacles.
Id. at 37.
Fujiki applies the same principles [as the ’927 patent] in
sustaining the alert condition, i.e., sustaining the brakes, for a
sustain time that varies as a function of relative vehicle speed.
Id. at 38 (citing Ex. 1002 ¶¶ 16–18).
It would have been obvious to modify radar-based object
detection systems . . . such as described by Bernhard, with the
sustained alerts of Pakett and Fujiki, and more particularly, the
alert sustained as a function of relative vehicle speed of Fujiki,
to ensure that the alert condition is only released under safe
conditions.
Id. at 39.
Patent Owner argues that Petitioner’s assertion it would have been
obvious to combine the references does not attempt to “explain why this is
so and does not even articulate what the person of ordinary skill in the art
would understand from the combination of references being proposed.”
Prelim. Resp. 22. The Petition is said to “merely catalog[] the parts of the
claims and attempt[s] to provide an index as to where those disparate parts
may be found in the cited references.” Id. at 23. Patent Owner further
argues that the combination of Bernhard, Pakett, and Fujiki would lead to a
different result than the ’927 patent claims and, specifically
result in a system in which a radar system (perhaps, for sake of
argument, used to detect objects in a vehicle’s blind-spot) uses
one or more techniques (e.g., measurements of Doppler shift as
taught by Pakett) to detect objects in adjacent lanes and the like,
and which employs a “persistence period” (as taught by Pakett)
13

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
during which no warnings are provided to a driver so as to filter
out stationary objects or other objects deemed to be of no
interest. After the expiration of a persistence period, the system
would, if an alert indication has been activated, check to see
whether or not the “warning has been on display for more than
one second without being reactivated.” If so the system would
cease displaying the warning. However, in all instances when
an alert was displayed, regardless of how long it was displayed,
the system would maintain the alert indication, as taught by
Fujiki. Such a system is manifestly different from that recited
in claim 1 of the ’927 Patent.
Id. at 14–18 (footnotes and citations omitted).
We agree with Patent Owner. An invention “composed of several
elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its
elements was, independently, known in the prior art.” KSR, 550 U.S. at 418.
A determination of unpatentability on a ground of obviousness, must also
include “‘articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support
the legal conclusion of obviousness.’” Id. (quoting In re Kahn, 441 F.3d
977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). The obviousness evaluation “should be made
explicit,” and it “can be important to identify a reason that would have
prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the
elements in the way the claimed new invention does.” Id.
Rather than articulated reasoning with rational underpinnings as to
why one of ordinary skill in the art would have looked to Bernhard and
Pakett’s alerting system when an obstacle is detected in a blind spot with
Fujiki’s braking system, Petitioner has provided only conclusory motivation
contentions. Petitioner’s argument lacks any reason, absent impermissible
hindsight, why one of ordinary skill in the art would have equated Fujiki’s
14

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
sustaining the brakes with Bernhard and Pakett’s sustaining an alert to arrive
at the claimed invention. See, e.g., Pet. 38 (“Like the ’927 patent addresses
this problem by sustaining the alert as a function of relative vehicle speed,
Fujiki applies the same principles in sustaining the alert condition, i.e.,
sustaining the brakes, for a sustain time that varies as a function of relative
vehicle speed.”). As discussed in Sections II.C.1 and II.C.2., supra,
Bernhard and Pakett each pertain to an alert system when obstacles are
detected in blind spots. Fujiki, on the other hand, pertains to a braking
system and does not mention or otherwise relate to blind spots.
Accordingly, Petitioner’s rationale is premised on a “bare recitation of
disparate claim elements scattered throughout multiple prior art references
stitched together with flawed logic and unsound conclusions.” Prelim. Resp.
23.
Moreover, Pakett teaches if a displayed warning has been displayed
for more than one second without reactivation, CPU 31 causes the warning
to cease being displayed. Ex. 1005, 7:64–8:10. In contrast, Fujiki teaches a
braking system that extends the braking time of a brake regardless of
whether a threshold time has been reached. Ex. 1006, 5:52–67; Fig. 8.
Pakett’s alert signal displaying for an additional one second is thus
conditioned on receiving an activation signal one second earlier, whereas
Fujiki extends the braking time of a brake regardless of any condition (e.g.,
threshold time) being reached. Ex. 1005, 7:64–8:10; Ex. 1006, 5:52–67; Fig.
8.
Petitioner’s excerpts from Bernhard, Pakett, and Fujiki about radarsystems are generic and bear no relation to any specific combination of prior
15

IPR2015-00968
Patent 5,714,927 B1
art elements. Specifically, Petitioner “fails to explain why a person of
ordinary skill in the art would have combined elements from specific
references in the way the claimed invention does.” ActiveVideo Networks,
Inc. v. Verizon Commc’ns, Inc., 694 F.3d 1312, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
Thus, we are not persuaded that the Petition demonstrates a reasonable
likelihood that Petitioner would prevail in establishing unpatentability of
claims 1, 2, and 6.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we are not persuaded the information
presented in the Petition establishes a reasonable likelihood that Petitioner
would prevail in establishing unpatentability of claims 1, 2, and 6 as obvious
over Bernhard, Pakett, and Fujiki.
IV. ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, it is
ORDERED that the Petition is denied as to all challenged claims and
no trial is instituted.
