DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Roger A. Krause et al. (Appellants) 1 seek our review under 35 U.S.C.
§ 134 of the Examiner's Final Rejection of claims 1--4, 8-14, and 16 under

35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as anticipated by Dodds (US 5,843,532, iss. Dec. 1,
1998); of claim 5 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Dodds and
McCormick (US 4,436,443, iss. Mar. 13, 1984); of claims 6, 7, and 15 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Dodds and Duffy (US 4,888,214,
iss. Dec. 19, 1989); and of claims 17-20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as

Application 13/593,995
unpatentable over McCormick and Dodds. We have jurisdiction under
35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We REVERSE.

CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claims 1, 12, and 17 are independent. Claim 1 is reproduced below
and illustrates the claimed subject matter, with disputed limitations
emphasized.
1. A method, comprising:

applying a first coating material on a threaded region of
an opening in a multi-piece assembly;
inserting at least one fastener to the threaded region, the
fastener including a mating thread selectively secured to the
threaded region of the opening to create a first friction interface
between the fastener and the multi-piece assembly; and
tensioning the fastener between a load surface of the multipiece assembly and a mating thread of the fastener to define a
second friction interface between the multi-piece assembly and
the fastener, the second friction interface being spaced away
from the threaded region such that the first coating material does
not influence the second friction interface.
ANALYSIS

Anticipation of claims 1--4, 8-14, and 16 by Dodds
We are persuaded by Appellants' arguments that the Examiner fails to
establish anticipation of claims 1-4, 8-14, and 16 by Dodds. See Appeal Br.
10-23 and Reply Br. 2-6.
The Examiner first finds that Dodds anticipates independent claims 1
and 12 by disclosing a method comprising, inter alia, "applying a first
coating material ... on a threaded region of an opening (36) ... in a multipiece assembly [and] inserting at least one fastener (112) to the threaded
2

Appeal2014-009182
Application 13/593,995
region." Final Act. 2, 4 (citing Dodds, col. 6, 11. 44--49 and Fig. 7). The
Examiner also determines that "we can be confident that coating is being
applied on the threads," because although "FIG. 23 illustrates that only the
outermost threads are covered by plug 112 and hanger 106[, Dodd explains
at column] 10, lines 55-58 [that] 'This arrangement is said to be a distinct
improvement over prior art arrangements which threaded a hanger directly
into the conduit opening, with damage to the threads or any protective
coating thereon."' Id. at 9. The Examiner concluded that this disclosure
illustrates that "[t]he threads, the ones inside the openings filled by hanger
106 and plug 112, can have protective coating thereon." Id.
The Examiner further augments the final rejection in an Advisory
Action dated December 30, 2013, observing that "[v]iewing the handle of
Dobbs in Figure 23 at about 200% resolution it is clear that coating (50) is
contacting the threads (36) in the handle of the device." Advisory Act. 3.
The Examiner also noted that "Figure 23A shows a mounting screw (20),
which is a threaded item, being inserted into a fastener hole (22) [that]
would be non-functional if the hole (22) failed to have cooperating threads,"
and concluded that "[a]s Figure 23 illustrates, there is coating (50) all around
the threads of the screw (20) and the threads of the hole (22)." Id.
In response, Appellants first point out that "it appears that the
Examiner has shifted positions [from the final rejection] by making
reference to hanger 106 and plug 112 of FIG. 23, and alleging that a coating
is on the inside threads, 'the ones inside openings filled by hanger 106 and
plug 112."' Appeal Br. 17. However, Appellants explain that "FIG. 23 is
merely a cutaway section [where] there is no coating on the threads at either
inner location, because threads in conduit openings 34 and 36 are blocked

3

Appeal2014-009182
Application 13/593,995
off and [are] part of the interior of the assembly once hanger 106 and plug
112 are installed." Id.
Also, while pointing out that "[t]he Advisory Action no longer alleges
'[t]he threads, the ones inside the openings filled by hanger 106 and plug
112, can have protective coating thereon,' as was set forth in the Final Office
Action dated September 24, 2013" (id. at 18), Appellants conclude that
"Dodds does not teach anything to do with coating a threaded region, into
which a fastener is then inserted," because "Dodds instead teaches an
assembly where the threaded region is precluded from receiving a coating, in
the conduit regions 34, 36, as well as in the threaded holes 24 of body 2" (id.
at 23).
While acknowledging that "the centerpiece of the Dodds reference is
coating the outside," the Examiner still determines that "'coating 50 [of
Dodds] is formed into sealing sleeves 52 and 54 which extend beyond the
outer ends 56 and 58 of the conduit openings 34 and 36 in the conduit hubs
30 and 32, respectively, and form corrosion resistant and sealing sleeves for
a conduit threaded into the conduit hubs 30 and 32."' Ans. 9-10 (again
citing Dodds, col. 6, 11. 44--49). Based on the foregoing excerpt, the
Examiner reasons that Dodds "discloses coating being/ormed into the
sealing sleeves 52 and 54 and therefore [the coating] must be going inside." 2
Id. at 10.

2

While not being relied upon, for the first time the Examiner also observes
that "the Dodds reference itself discloses other patents owned by the same
assignee of the present invention ... which undeniably teach placing coating
on both the internal and external threads." Ans. 9. However, in an appeal
under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), it is the Examiner's final rejection that we review.
See In re Webb, 916 F.2d 1553, 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

Appeal2014-009182
Application 13/593,995
In response, Appellants first point out that "with respect to the terms
'formed into,' Figure 6 shows a cross-section of the perspective view of
Figure 2," where "sleeve materials 52 and 54 [are] formed of coating
material 50 [that] is clearly external of the original assembly." Reply Br. 4.
We agree with Appellants that "the Examiner has misunderstood the terms
'formed into,"' and that "[a]s can be clearly seen in Figures 2 and 6 [of
Dodds], the sleeves 52 and 54 are made of the coating material and are
formed in the process of adding the coating, and thus the coating 50 is
'formed into' the sleeves 52, 54." Id. at 4-5; see also Dodds, col. 6, 11. 4451. We further agree with Appellants' characterization that what "Dodds
teaches [is] that there is 'no thread coat damage' (that is, no damage to the
threads by coating getting into them)." See id. at 5-6.
Further, in response to the Examiner's findings as to fastener hole 22
having internal threads, Appellants point to the description in Dodds of the
assembly of cover 12 and tooling plate 70, and assert that fastener hole 22 is
"a through-hole, through which screw 20 passes to threaded hole 24 of body
2." Appeal Br. 22 (citing Dodds, col. 8, 11. 30-38). Appellants assert that
"the coating is precluded from entering the threaded region 24 because the
screw 20 is present therein." Id. at 23. We are persuaded by Appellants'
argument. Even though Figure 23A appears to show coating 50 on the
inside of fastener hole 22, Dodds does not describe fastener hole 22 as
threaded, and based on the description of the assembly provided in Dodds,
fastener hole 22 is not necessarily threaded, and could be a through-hole, as
posited by Appellants. Thus, there is inadequate disclosure in Dodds to
support a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Dodds discloses
coating 50 applied on a threaded region, as claimed. Further, we agree with

5

Appeal2014-009182
Application 13/593,995
Appellants that the disclosure in Dodds supports a finding that due to the
presence of screw 20 within threaded region 24 at the time the coating is
applied, coating 50 would be precluded from entering threaded region 24 on
body 2.
Thus, we find the positions taken by the Examiner to be unsupported
by the evidence of record. In particular, we do not agree with the Examiner
that Dodds discloses "applying a first coating material on a threaded region
of an opening in a multi-piece assembly," as recited in claims 1 and 12.
[U]nless a reference discloses within the four comers of the
document not only all of the limitations claimed but also all of
the limitations arranged or combined in the same way as recited
in the claim, it cannot be said to prove prior invention of the thing
claimed and, thus, cannot anticipate under 35 U.S.C. § 102.

Net MoneyIN, Inc., v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 F.3d 1359, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
For the foregoing reasons, we do not sustain the Examiner's decision
rejecting claims 1-4, 8-14, and 16 as anticipated by Dodds.

Obviousness of claim 5 over Dodds and McCormick; of claims 6, 7,
and 15 over Dodds and Dujjj;; and of claims 17-20 over McCormick and
Dodds.
Regarding the claims 5-7, 15, and 17-20, each of the Examiner's
rejections is based on the same unsupported findings discussed above with
respect to the disclosure of Dodds. 3 See generally Final Act. 6-8. The
3

Independent claim 17 is directed to "[a] connecting rod assembly,
comprising ... a connecting rod portion ... defining an opening having a
first thread, the first thread having a coating material applied thereon."
Appeal Br. 30 (Claims App.). For the rejection of claim 17, the Examiner
relies on Dodds to "teach [] coating materials for threaded holes." Final
Act. 7.
6

Appeal2014-009182
Application 13/593,995
addition of McCormick or Duffy does not remedy the deficiencies of Dodds,
as discussed supra.
Accordingly, for similar reasons as discussed above for claim 1, we
do not sustain the Examiner's decision rejecting claim 5 over Dodds and
McCormick; claims 6, 7, and 15 over Dodds and Duffy; and claims 17-20
over McCormick and Dodds.

DECISION
The Examiner's prior-art rejections are reversed.

REVERSED
