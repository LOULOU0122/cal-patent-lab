Exemplary Claim
Claim 19, reproduced below, is representative of the subject matter on
appeal (emphasis added to contested limitation):
19.

Prior Art

The Examiner relies upon the following prior art as evidence in
rejecting the claims on appeal:
Kojima et al. ("Kojima")

US 5,448,159

Sept. 5, 1995

Mitsui et al. ("Mitsui")

US 6,297 ,624 Bl Oct. 2, 2001

Rejection on Appeal

Claims 19-22 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
obvious over the combination of Mitsui and Kojima. Final Act. 2.
ISSUE
Appellant argues (App. Br. 3-10; Reply Br. 1-8) the Examiner's
rejection of claim 19 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being obvious over the
combination of Mitsui and Kojima is in error. These contentions present us
with the following issue:
Did the Examiner err in finding the cited prior art combination teaches
or suggests a semiconductor device that includes, inter alia, a "reference
potential generating circuit ... configured to generate first and second

3

Appeal2015-000694
Application 12/793,033
reference potentials such that the first reference potential goes up and the
second reference potential goes down in accordance with a temperature
increase of the semiconductor device," as recited in claim 19?
ANALYSIS
We agree with particular arguments advanced by Appellant with
respect to claims 19-22 for the specific reasons discussed below. We
highlight and address specific findings and arguments regarding claim 19 for
emphasis as follows.
Appellant contends the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 19 over the
combination of Mitsui and Kojima, particularly because Kojima, relied upon
by the Examiner as teaching or suggesting the contested limitation, "is
directed to generating a single reference voltage V REF having its temperature
dependency cancelled by connecting a constant current source block 1 (as a
constant current source having positive temperature dependency) to a load
circuit block 2 (having a negative temperature dependency)." App. Br. 5
(citing Kojima, col. 2, 11. 28-39 ("To attain the above object, in the present
invention, a load circuit having a negative temperature dependency and
composed of a series-parallel connection of a plurality of MOS transistors
each of which is diode-connected is connected to a constant current source
having a positive temperature dependency whose current value is determined
by a current mirror circuit, a plurality of MOS transistors composing two
loads of the current mirror circuit and a single resistor so that the voltage
generated by the load circuit is outputted as the reference voltage.")
(emphasis in original)). Id.

Appeal2015-000694
Application 12/793,033
Further in this regard, Appellant reemphasizes that Kojima does not
teach or suggest generating both first and second reference potentials with
their respective temperature dependencies, as claimed (App. Br. 6), but
instead merely:
discloses generating a single reference voltage VREF by
connecting a constant current source block 1 (as a constant
current source having positive temperature dependency) to
a load circuit block 2 (having a negative temperature
dependency) "so as to cancel the positive temperature
dependency of the current of said constant current source."
App. Br. 7 (citing Kojima, claim 1, col. 2, 11. 28-39, and col. 3, 11. 40-54.).
Appellant further maintain:
[E]ven if a person having ordinary skill in the art attempted
to replace Mitsui's reference voltage generating circuits 2s,
2p with Kojima's reference voltage generator 1, 2, they
would readily and immediately recognize that the supplied
reference voltages would have their respective temperature
dependencies cancelled as a 'vhole, and as a result, the claim
requirement - of providing a first reference potential that
goes up and a second reference potential that goes down in
accordance with a temperature increase of the
semiconductor device - would not be met by the proposed
combination of Mitsui and Kojima.
Id.

The Examiner responds by pointing to Mitsui as disclosing:
the INTERNAL POWER SUPPLY CIRCUIT (e.g., internal
power circuit 1; in Fig. 1 and related in Figs. 2-5) generates the
first reference potential goes up Vref from 0°C to positive
Temperature °C equivalent with VI and Vee as shown in Fig. 4,
and generates the reference potential Vrefp, and equivalently
corresponds to internal power supply voltage Vccp as shown in
Fig. 5. Similarly, generates the second reference potential goes

down Vref from negative Temperature °C to 0°C equivalent
with V2 and V cc as shown in Fig. 4, and generates the
reference potential Vrefs, and equivalently corresponds to
internal power supply voltage Vccs as shown in Fig. 5.
Ans. 2-3.

"FIG. 5 shows a structure of a main portion of a semiconductor

Appeal2015-000694
Application 12/793,033
The Examiner finds, "the reference of Mitsui discloses one of two
references potential Vrefp/Vrefs corresponding to internal power supply
voltage Vccp/Vccs is goes up/down in accordance with a temperature
increase as shown in Figs. 4--5 of Mitsui and related in Figs. 1-2 of Mitsui."
Ans. 3. We disagree with the Examiner's finding regarding the teaching of
Mitsui, particularly Figure 4B.
We disagree because Figure 4B teaches a single reference voltage
being generated, but one in which:
a boundary region (temperature at which the temperature
characteristic changes) between the low and high temperature
regions is set to a temperature near 0° C. However, this
boundary temperature may be set to an appropriate value in
accordance with the operation temperature region in which the
reference voltage generating circuit or the semiconductor
memory device operates.
Mitsui col. 15, 1. 63 through col. 16, 1. 2.
We also disagree with the Examiner's reliance upon Mitsui Figure 5
because Mitsui actually teaches "reference voltages Vrefp and Vrefs can
have the same temperature characteristics, and the temperature
characteristics and voltage levels of internal power supply voltages Vccp
and Vccs can be held constant over a wide temperature range so that the
internal circuits (peripheral circuits and sense amplifier circuit) can operate
stably." Mitsui col. 16, 11. 19-24.
The Examiner further cites Kojima Figure 5 as teaching:
one reference voltage output from -0.1 V to 0.4V with n =2, and
the other reference voltage output from 0 .1 V to -0 .2V with
n = 3 in accordance with the temperature increase from 0°C to
150°C as shown in Fig. 5 of Kojima, and equivalent with
7

Appeal2015-000694
Application 12/793,033
internal voltage generating circuits 15A-15C in Fig. 1 and Fig.
14 of appellant.
Ans. 4.
However, we note "FIG. 5 [of Kojima] is a graph showing a deviation
of reference voltage depending on temperature (reference ofVREF: 25° C.)
in the reference voltage generator in FIG. 1." Kojima col. 3, 11. 7-9. We
find Kojima Figure 5 teaches temperature dependency of the reference
voltage based upon different gain coefficient ratios, and does not teach or
suggest generation of two different reference voltages with opposite
temperature dependencies, as claimed. See Kojima col. 5, 11. 49---66.
Accordingly, based upon the findings above, on this record, we are
persuaded of at least one error in the Examiner's reliance on the combined
teachings and suggestions of the cited prior art combination to teach or
suggest the disputed limitation of claim 19, such that we find error in the
Examiner's resulting legal conclusion of obviousness. Therefore, we cannot
sustain the Examiner's obviousness rejection of independent claim 19, and
claims 20-22 which depend therefrom and stand therewith. See Claim
Grouping, supra.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner erred with respect to the obviousness rejection of
claims 19-22 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over the cited prior art combination
of record, and we do not sustain the rejection.
DECISION
We reverse the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 19-22.
