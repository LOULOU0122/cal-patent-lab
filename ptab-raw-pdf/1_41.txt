Before CARLA M. KRIVAK, CARL W. WHITEHEAD JR, and
ADAM J. PYONIN, Administrative Patent Judges.
WHITEHEAD JR., Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants are appealing the Final Rejection of claims 21--41 under
35 U.S.C. § 134(a). Appeal Brief 5. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C.

§ 6(b) (2012).
We affirm.
Introduction
The invention is directed to pausing push services transmissions from
the server when the user terminal is switched on but is not in actual use.
Specification 2: 15-17.

Representative Claim
21. A method, comprising:

Appeal2015-002932
Application 12/738,306
transmitting messages of at least one push service from a server to a
user terminal, the server sending the messages of the push service without a
separate request for a single transmission by the user terminal;
defining for a user terminal at least two separate activation states, each
of the activation states corresponding to a predefined functionality set of a
switched-on user terminal, wherein the functionality set is presently
applicable to the user;
detecting in the user terminal a current activation state of the user
terminal;
sending an indication on the detected current activation state of the
user terminal from the user terminal to the server; and
adjusting the sending of messages from the server to the user terminal
according to the indication on the current activation state of the user terminal
sent by the user terminal,
wherein at least one of the at least two activation states comprises a
power-save mode.
Rejections on Appeal

Claims 21-25, 31, 32 and 36-41 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as being unpatentable over Zhao (US Patent Application
Publication Number 2004/0224694 Al; published November 11, 2004) and
Narayanaswami (US Patent Number 8, 117,299 B2; issued February 14,
2012). Final Rejection 7-11.
Claims 26-30 and 33-35 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
being unpatentable over Zhao, Narayanaswami and Fleck (US Patent
Application Publication Number 2005/0066006 Al; published March 24,
2005). Final Rejection 11-12.
ANALYSIS
Rather than reiterate the arguments of Appellants and the Examiner,
we refer to the Appeal Brief (filed October 22, 2014), the Reply Brief (filed
January 23, 2015), the Answer (mailed November 24, 2014) and the Final
Rejection (mailed April 4, 2014) for the respective details. We have
2

Appeal2015-002932
Application 12/738,306
considered in this decision only those arguments Appellants actually raised
in the Briefs.
Appellants argue the Examiner's obviousness rejection of independent
claim 21 is erroneous because: (a) there is "No Reason (such as teaching,
motivation, or suggestion) to Combine [the] References;" (b) "'Reachable'
and 'Unreachable' are not Activation States;" (c) there is "No Obvious Way
to Modify Zhao in view ofNarayanaswami;" and (d) there is "No Obvious
Benefit of [the] Alleged Combination." Appeal Brief 15-22.
The Examiner finds the combination of Zhao and Narayanaswami
discloses the claimed invention. Final Rejection 8. We agree with the
Examiner's findings. Zhao discloses:
A method and system of reachability indication between a
wireless device and at least one push server, the method
comprising the steps of: sending device status information from
the wireless device to the at least one push server; and receiving
the status information at the at least one push server; wherein the
at least one push server is enabled to selectively start and stop
serving the wireless device on the basis of the status information.
Zhao Abstract.
This is-in essence-what the claimed invention is directed towards.
See claim 21; Specification 2. The Examiner relies upon Narayanaswami to
disclose having a power-save mode as an activation state, and finds that it
would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify Zhao' s
activation states to include a power save mode or state. Final Rejection 8-9;
see also Narayanaswami 2:20-31, claim 1. We do not find Appellants'
arguments persuasive because they are merely conclusory. 1 For the same

1

Attorney "argument ... cannot take the place of evidence." In re Pearson,
494 F.2d 1399, 1405 (CCPA 1974). See, e.g., In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465,
3

Appeal2015-002932
Application 12/738,306
reasons, we are not persuaded the Examiner erred in rejecting the remaining
claims 22--41. See Appeal Brief 22-32. Rather than replicate the
Examiner's findings, we adopt as our own (1) the findings and reasons set
forth by the Examiner in the action from which this appeal is taken and (2)
the reasons set forth by the Examiner in the Examiner's Answer in response
to Appellants' Appeal Brief. See Final Rejection 7-12; Answer 10-22.

DECISION
The Examiner's obviousness rejections of claims 21--41 are affirmed.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv). See 37
C.F.R. § 41.50(±).

AFFIRivIED

1470 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (attorney arguments or conclusory statements are
insufficient to rebut a prima facie case).
