DECISION ON APPEAL

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 1
Rick A. Hamilton II, James R. Kozloski, Brian M. O'Connell, Clifford
A. Pickover, and Keith R. Walker (Appellants) seek review under
35 U.S.C. § 134 of a final rejection of claims 1-5, 8-15, and 17-20, the only

Our decision will make reference to the Appellants' Appeal Brief ("App.
Br.," filed April 30, 2013) and Reply Brief ("Reply Br.," filed December 6,
2013), and the Examiner's Answer ("Ans.," mailed October 11, 2013), and
Final Action ("Final Act.," mailed November 5, 2012).

claims pending in the application on appeal. 2 We have jurisdiction over the
appeal pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
The Appellants invented a way of linking dual accounts for composite
monetary and carbon credit value consideration in a transaction.
Specification para. 1.
An understanding of the invention can be derived from a reading of
exemplary claim 1, which is reproduced below (bracketed matter and some
paragraphing added).
1. A method for linking and utilizing monetary and carbon

credit accounts in consideration of a transaction, comprising:
[1] a programmable arbitrating device

providing a transaction interface to a buyer
that links a monetary account of the buyer to a carbon
credit account of the buyer;
and
[2] the arbitrating device automatically executing a purchase of
an item offered for sale to the buyer by a seller
at a composite price that has a monetary portion and a
carbon credit portion,
in response to an input of the buyer to the arbitrating
device transaction interface
as a function of a monetary-carbon exchange rate,
by:
[3] comparing the monetary-carbon exchange rate
to a rate threshold;

The claims as entered are those in an amendment filed January 2, 2013,
after the Final Action. This amendment was entered according to an
Advisory Action mailed January 16, 2103.

[4] in response to the monetary-carbon exchange
rate meeting the compared rate threshold,
charging a first monetary payment from the
buyer's monetary account,
charging a first carbon credit payment from
the buyer's carbon credit account
and
converting a first amount of a balance of a
selected one of the monetary and carbon
credit account
to generate a first converted monetary/
carbon credit payment as a function of the
monetary-carbon exchange rate,
so that
a percentage of a monetary payment
amount relative to a carbon credit
payment amount in a total of
the first monetary payment,
the first carbon credit payment
and
the first converted monetary/
carbon credit payment
satisfies
a specified carbon credit/monetary
proportion that is associated with the
rate threshold;
and
[5] in response to the monetary-carbon exchange
rate not meeting the compared rate threshold,
charging a second monetary payment from
the buyer's monetary account that is
different from the first monetary payment,
and

charging a second carbon credit payment
from the buyer's carbon credit account that
is different from the first carbon credit
payment.

The Examiner relies upon the following prior art:
Pollack

US 2008/0249965 Al

Oct. 9, 2008

Vaswani US 2010/0228601 Al

Sept. 9, 2010

Claims 1-5, 9-15, and 17-20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Pollack and Vaswani. 3

ISSUES
The issues of obviousness tum primarily on whether the prior art
describes varying the relative amounts of carbon credits and monetary
portions in a composite price to automatically produce different proportions
as a function of an exchange rate.

FACTS PERTINENT TO THE ISSUES
The following enumerated Findings of Fact (FF) are believed to be
supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

3

A rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph and a rejection under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over The Leahy-Smith America Invents
Act (AIA), section 14 were withdrawn in an Advisory Action mailed
January 16, 2013.

Facts Related to the Prior Art
Pollack

01.Pollack is directed to automatically calculating a custom offset fee
that purchasers may voluntarily pay to offset the negative
environmental impacts of the fuel they purchase, at the time and
point of sale. Pollack para. 16.
02. The offset payment can be collected in one of two ways: either as
a separate line item in the fuel purchase transaction, or as an
embedded portion of the fuel product price. Pollack para. 18.
03.Pollack describes the offset payment being calculated in real time
based upon specific temporal, spatial, or climatic factors that may
affect the pollution characteristics of the fuel being purchased.
Pollack para. 20.
04.Pollack may offer the user a second choice of making an offset
payment by adding an offset surcharge to the fuel product's price,
or by offering a version of the fuel product with the offset
surcharge included in the price. In various implementations,
Pollack accepts payment via cash, credit card or pre-paid
environmental offset points. Pollack para. 27.
05.Pollack describes the custom offset engine calculating a custom
offset payment or debit in real time based on actual usage data.
Pollack para. 34--35.

Appeal2014-002453
Application 12/330,545
Vaswani

06. Vaswani is directed to electrical energy consumption; information
relating to electrical energy usage for a given account is associated
with a time segment that corresponds to a period when the
electrical energy was received from an electrical energy
distribution system. Vaswani para. 5.
07. Vaswani describes electrical energy generation carbon impact
information indicating carbon released to generate the electrical
energy during the corresponding time segment. A carbon credit is
calculated according to the retrieved electrical energy generation
carbon impact information, and the retrieved electrical energy
usage information associated with the time segment. The
calculated carbon credit is then used to update a display of carbon
credit related information, such as account balance, rate of carbon
credit usage, currently applicable "cost" for carbon credit usage,
or the like. Notifications can be provided to the consumer if any
of this information crosses a threshold value. Id.
08.Vaswani describes an example in which a customer of utility E
has a monthly carbon credit allotment of 32,000 credits, which are
credited to the customer's account at utility E. Typical usage is
below the monthly allotment by, on average, 5,000 credits.
However, some months the monthly allotment is exceeded by
3,000 or 4,000 credits. The customer typically sells excess credits
from a brokerage account held with a financial institution G. To
facilitate selling, the customer puts in place carbon credit balance

6

Appeal2014-002453
Application 12/330,545
transfer rules with utility E which specify: if the carbon credit
account balance at the utility reaches 50,000 credits or more,
credits in excess of 40,000 credits are to be transferred to the
customer's brokerage account with financial institution G.
Vaswani para. 88.

ANALYSIS
We are persuaded by Appellants' argument that "no teachings are
provided as to varying the relative amounts of carbon credits and monetary
portions in a composite price to automatically produce different proportions
as a function of an exchange rate as specifically claimed." Reply Br. 2. The
Examiner finds this would be obvious to try. Ans. 3--4. The Examiner
provides no analytic framework for why this would be obvious to try other
than to find that the references describe using rules to test thresholds
generally. The recited implementation of testing based on mix proportions
instead of monetary or credit amounts as described in the references is far
too detailed for one of ordinary skill to sense the implementation as a case to
try without more description in the direction of the recited implementation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The rejection of claims 1-5, 9-15, and 17-20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)
as unpatentable over Pollack and Vaswani is improper.
