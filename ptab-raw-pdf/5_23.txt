Shintani's Figure 2 shows a set-top box (STB) 22 having a card reader
140 to read a user's card for authentication and to authorize the user to
access to media content from a media server 10 or other remote server 48,
via a network 44. Shintani i131.
The Examiner acknowledges Shintani does not expressly teach, but
relies on Thomas to expressly teach, user access to different types of content
over a network, including (1) "first portion ... located at a second
communication device deployed at the first geographic location" and
(2) "second portion ... located at a third communications device deployed at

4

Appeal2015-000309
Application 13/216,457
a second geographical location" as recited in claim 26 in order to support the
conclusion of obviousness. Ans. 5---6 (citing Thomas i-fi-1 51-54, 58, 87-89,
Figs 2 and 6B).
Appellants contend the Examiner erred in finding Shintani discloses
the disputed limitation: "a card carrying information related to one or more
user-defined selections of information content ... [which] allows the first
communication device to access" different types of content over a network,
including (1) "first portion ... located at a second communication device
deployed at the first geographic location" and (2) "second portion ...
located at a third communications device" as recited in claim 26. App. Br.
6-9; Reply Br. 3--4. According to Appellants, Shintani's card "is simply
used for authentication purposes" and does not carry "information related to
one or more user-defined selections of information content" or provide
"remote access of media content located at other devices at the same
geographic locations as well as other geographic locations." App. Br. 7-8.
In addition, Appellants argue "Thomas teaches away from a card, suggesting
that on-demand media content is accessed directly through a remote network
server." Id. at 8 (emphasis in original).
Appellants further argue there is no teaching, suggestion, or
motivation (TSM) to combine Shintani and Thomas because (1) there is "no
nexus between the card in the STB of Shintani and remote access of content
either in a second device at the same geographic location or in
communication devices located at other geographic locations," and (2) there
is no reason for a person skilled in the art to look to Thomas for making the
combination. Id. at 8-9.

5

Appeal2015-000309
Application 13/216,457
We do not find Appellants' arguments persuasive. Instead, we find
the Examiner has provided a comprehensive response to Appellants'
arguments supported by a preponderance of evidence. Ans. 18-24. As
such, we adopt the Examiner's findings and explanations provided therein.
Id. For example, as recognized by the Examiner, Shintani's card, as inserted

into a card reader 140 of the set-top box (STB) 22, shown in Figure 2,
contains not only information used for authentication but, once authorized,
permits access (local or remote) to media content available anywhere in the
network 100, including the media server 10, via a transmission medium 20
(e.g., cable network, satellite system, or wireless system) or other remote
server 48, via the Internet 44, shown in Figure 1. Id. at 19; see also Shintani

iTiT 21, 27.
Contrary to Appellants' arguments, Thomas is only cited for expressly
teaching accessing remote devices at different locations in the same network.
Ans. 21. To the extent Appellants' argument would require the Examiner's
rationale to conform to a rigid "teaching, suggestion, or motivation" test
(TSM test), such an approach was foreclosed by KSR International Co. v.
Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 415 (2007). The Court repudiated any

requirement for such a "precise teaching" to show obviousness. KSR, 550
U.S. at 415 ("We begin by rejecting the rigid approach of the Court of
Appeals."). Rather, the requirement is only that the Examiner show "the
subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention
was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject
matter pertains." KSR, 550 U.S. at 406 (quoting 35 U.S.C. § 103)(emphasis
added); id. at 418 ("[T]he analysis need not seek out precise teachings
directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for a court

6

Appeal2015-000309
Application 13/216,457
can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of
ordinary skill in the art would employ."). We conclude that the Examiner
provides just such showings in the rejection. Ans. 6-7, 19-24.
Additionally, Appellants have not presented evidence sufficient to
show that combining the prior art was "uniquely challenging or difficult for
one of ordinary skill in the art" or "represented an unobvious step over the
prior art." Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-Price, Inc., 485 F.3d 1157, 1162
(Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing KSR, 550 U.S. at 418-19). Nor have Appellants
presented evidence that any of their incorporations of known limitations
yielded more than expected results.
For these reasons, we sustain the Examiner's obviousness rejection of
claim 26 and its dependent claims 27-34, which Appellants do not argue
separately.

§ 103(a) Rejection of Claims 35-38 based on Thomas and Shintani

With respect to claims 35-38, Appellants reiterate the same arguments
presented against claims 26-34. For the same reasons discussed, we also
sustain the Examiner's obviousness rejection of claims 35-38.

§ 103(a) Rejection of Claims 39--45 based on Thomas and Reta

In contrast to claims 26-34, independent claim 39 does not require the
use of a card at a set-top box (STB) to access media content. Rather, claim
39 only requires "a subscription with a server" to permit a user to select "at
least one multimedia service to be provided to a first communication device
at a first geographic location and/or a second communication device at a
second geographic location" and then access "the selected at least one

7

Appeal2015-000309
Application 13/216,457
multimedia service by the first communication device, upon authentication
of the first communication device."
The Examiner finds Thomas teaches Appellants' claimed "method for
communication multimedia information in a communication network"
including all the recited steps, except for a "subscription allowing for access
by the first communication device and the second communication device to
the selected at least one multimedia service" as disclosed by Reto. Ans. 14-16 (citing Thomas i-fi-138, 52, 53, 70, 74, 77-81, 107-112, Figs. 1-2; Reto
i-f 165-167, 173, Fig. 34).
Appellants dispute the Examiner's factual findings regarding Reto. In
particular, Appellants argue Reto simply teaches "inviting another user to
purchase and watch pay-per-view content together on a client device[,]" and
such a disclosure "is not equivalent to 'the subscription allowing for access
by the first communication device and the second communication device to
the selected at least one multimedia service."' App. Br. 12.
We disagree with Appellants. As correctly recognized by the
Examiner, "[t]he pay-per-view content of Reto" allows "individual
purchases of the pay-per-view content for access to multiple devices to the
same content using only a single authentication." Ans. 26.
For these reason, we sustain the Examiner's obviousness rejection of
claim 39 and its dependent claims 40-46, which Appellants do not argue
separately.

8

Appeal2015-000309
Application 13/216,457
CONCLUSION
On the record before us, we conclude Appellants have not
demonstrated the Examiner erred in rejecting claims 26-45 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103(a).

DECISION
As such, we AFFIRM the Examiner's final rejection of claims 26-45.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
