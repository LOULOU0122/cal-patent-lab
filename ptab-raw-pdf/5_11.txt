BEFORE THE PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD

Ex parte YI-LAN WANG and XINTIAN MING 1

Appeal2014-006948
Application 12/975,589
Technology Center 1600

Before ERIC B. GRIMES, ROBERT A. POLLOCK, and JACQUELINE T.
HARLOW, Administrative Patent Judges.
GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. ยง 134 involving claims to a
hemostatic preparation, which have been rejected as obvious. We have
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. ยง 6(b ).
We reverse.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Claims 1-10 are on appeal. Claim 1 is the only independent claim
and reads as follows:
1.

1

A topical hemostatic preparation comprising:
an extract of the rhizomes of Golden Moss,

Appellants identify the Real Party in Interest as Ethicon, Inc. (Br. 3.)

a gelatin,
and a saline solution.
DISCUSSION
The Examiner has rejected claims 1-8 under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as
obvious based on Wu2 and Wolff. 3 (Ans. 2.) The Examiner has rejected
claims 1-10 under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as obvious based on Wu and
Saferstein. 4 (Ans. 4.) The same issue is dispositive for both rejections.
The Examiner finds that Wu teaches that the "rhizome hairs of
Cibotium barometz is an anti-inflammatory and can be used as a poultice on

wounds to stop bleeding." (Id. at 2.) "Cibotium barometz is another name
for Golden Moss." (Id. at 3.) The Examiner also finds that Wu teaches
"active compounds ... isolated from an aqueous ethanol extract from the
rhizomes of Cibotium barometz." (Id. at 2.)
The Examiner finds that Wolff teaches "a hemostatic bleeding control
composition ... [that] preferably comprises an absorbable gelatin and a
saline solution." (Id. at 3.) Similarly, the Examiner finds that Saferstein
teaches "a hemostatic collagen paste composition ... compris[ing] a saline
solution and a hemostatic enhancing amount of thrombin and glycerol which
is dissolved in the composition to achieve long term stability." (Id. at 4.)

Application 12/975,589

The Examiner concludes that "both Wu et al. and Wolff teach
hemostat agents to stop bleeding wounds and thus it would be obvious to
further add or combine compositions that are useful for the same purpose."
(Id.) Similarly, the Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious "to

further include glycerol taught by Saferstein et al. in the composition
(hemostatic) of Wu et al. because it achieved long term stability in
hemostatic compositions." (Id. at 5.)
Appellants argue that Wu "notes that the yellow hairs on the rhizomes
[of Golden Moss] have been used in poultices to stop bleeding" (Br. 6) but
"to the extent Wu contemplates using the Golden Moss as a hemostatic
agent; the material is not an extracted material, but the 'hairs' in a poultice"
(id. at 7). Appellants argue that there is no evidence showing that the

compounds extracted by Wu have hemostatic activity and "[t]herefore, the
record lacks any basis for one to reasonably expect that an extract from the
Golden Moss, as opposed to the hairs of Golden Moss, could be combined
with gelatin and saline to produce a topical hemostatic preparation." (Id.)
We agree with Appellants that the cited references do not support a
prima facie case of obviousness. Both rejections cite Wu as disclosing an
extract from rhizomes of Golden Moss containing compounds with
hemostatic activity. This finding is not supported by the evidence.
Wu discloses that "[t]he rhizome of Cibotium barometz is antiinflammatory" and "[t]he yellow hairs on the rhizomes are used in poultices
on wounds to stop bleeding." (Wu 417, right col.) Wu discloses that "[t]he
dried rhizomes removed [sic] the smaller roots and yellow hairs of Cibotium

barometz (7 kg) were powdered and extracted with 70% aqueous ethanol."

Appeal2014-006948
Application 12/975,589

(Id. at 418, left col.) Wu states that column chromatography (CC)

"separations from 70% aqueous ethanol extract of dried rhizomes of
Cibotium barometz have led to the isolation of: three sesquiterpenes ... and

an unusual orthoester spiropyranosyl derivative of proto-catechuic acid."
(Id. at 419, right col.) Wu states that the intestinal permeability of three of

the compounds was tested in an in vitro model system; one was found to be
well-absorbed and two were found to be poorly absorbed. (Id. at 422, left
col.)
Wu does not disclose that any of the compounds isolated from its
ethanol extract, or the ethanol extract itself, has any hemostatic activity. It
states that the yellow hairs on the rhizomes of Golden Moss have been used
to stop bleeding, but it also states that its extract was derived from "dried
rhizomes removed [sic] the smaller roots and yellow hairs." (Id. at 418, left
col.) Wu also states that "[t]he rhizomes are harvested at the end of the
growing season, the smaller roots and yellow hairs are removed then the
rhizomes are chipped into slices and dried for later use." (Id. at 41 7, right
col.)
Thus, we understand Wu to say that its extract was derived from
rhizomes from which the yellow hairs had been removed. Only the yellow
hairs are disclosed to have hemostatic use. In view of these disclosures, we
agree with Appellants that Wu would not have made obvious the use of an
extract of the rhizomes of Golden Moss in a hemostatic composition. We
therefore reverse both of the rejections on appeal.

REVERSED
