DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from the final rejection of
claims 22-38. Claims 22-38 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over the combined teachings of Butterworth (US 3,958,023,
iss. May 18, 1976) and/or Van Den Eynde (US 6,117,459, iss. Sept. 12,
2000) and/or BAS F's "60th Anniversary of Povidone" (BASF, 60th
Anniversary of Povidone, 2 BASF ExAcT 4 (1999) (hereinafter "601h

Anniversary")) and/or Wedlock (US 5,665,369, iss. Sept. 9, 1997) and/or

AAP A (Applicants' Admitted Prior Art). We have jurisdiction under
35 U.S.C. § 6.
Appellants' invention relates generally to filter aids comprising
thermoplastic polymers as and stabilizers for filtration and/or stabilization of
aqueous liquids. (Spec. 1, 11. 4-6). Claim 22 is illustrative of the subject
matter on appeal:
22. A filter aid for filtering and stabilizing an aqueous liquid,
the filter aid comprising a comminuted form of a compounded
polymer obtained by reactive compounding of
a) 20-95% by weight of polystyrene; and
b) 80-5% by weight of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone
wherein the reactive compounding is selected from the
group consisting of rolling, kneading, casting, sintering,
pressing, compounding, calendaring, extrusion or combination
thereof.
Claims Appendix to App. Br.
OPINION 1, 2
After consideration of Appellants' arguments and evidence and the
Examiner's position in the Final Office Action and Answer we AFFIRM the
obviousness determination.

1

The issues arising in this appeal, specifically the discussion of "reactive
compounding," are similar to the issues presented in the appeal of
Application 10/509,641, Appeal 2015-005142.
2
We refer to the Final Office Action, mailed October 1, 2013, for a
complete statement of the Examiner's rejection. (Final Act. 2-13).

Appeal2014-006990
Application 10/398,179

We begin our analysis by determining the meaning of "reactive
compounding" as required by the subject matter of independent claim 22.
According to the Specification "reaction ... is a process in which at
least two substances are reacted physically and/or chemically with one
another." (Spec. 7, 11. 8-10, emphasis added). The Specification further
discloses reactive compounding is achieved by "rolling, kneading, casting,
sintering, pressing, compounding, calandering, extrusion or combination of
these methods." (Id. at 11. 15-16). Claim 22, which specifically states
"wherein the reactive compounding is selected from the group consisting of
rolling, kneading, casting, sintering, pressing, compounding, calandering,
extrusion or combination thereof," is consistent with the disclosure from the
Specification.
Thus, the present record indicates that reactive compounding is
physically and/or chemically reacting of components that can be achieved
by, inter alia, compounding.
The next issue on appeal is whether it would have been obvious to a
person of ordinary skill in the art to form a comminuted filter aid from a
reactive compounded polystyrene and a polyvinylpolypyrrolidone as
required by the subject matter of independent claim 22? 3
According to the Specification, "[f]ilter aids and stabilizers have
previously been used separately or together." (Spec. 2, 11. 26-27). The
Specification discloses that highly crosslinked polyvinylpolypyrrolidones

3

We limit our discussion to independent claim 22. Appellants have not
argued the independent claims 33, 35 and 36 and dependent claims 23-32,
34, 37 and 38 separately. Accordingly, claims not argued separately will
stand or fall together with independent claim 22.
3

Appeal2014-006990
Application 10/398,179

(PVPP) as stabilizers and filter aids are known to persons of ordinary skill in
the art. (Id. at 11. 32-33, citing EP 351 363). The Specification also
discloses polystyrene is a known filtering aid. (Id. at 11. 37-38, citing US
4,344,846). The process of forming solid formulations from polymers and
fillers is known to persons of ordinary skill the art. According to the
Specification, "[ c]ompounding is generally mixing a polymer with at least
one additive." (Id. at 6, 11. 11-12).
The Examiner found that Butterworth discloses a process for treating
liquids comprising PVPP and conventional filter aids. (Final Act. 2).
Butterworth discloses increasing the chill haze stability of aqueous liquids
derived from fruits and vegetables, by using one or more haze control agents
and filtering aids in a precoat or after precoat layer in the filter media.
(Butterworth, col. 2, 11. 54-59). The Examiner found that Van Den Eynde
discloses a process for treating liquids comprising PVPP and polystyrene.
(Final Act. 9). The Examiner found that "Van Den Eynde, like Butterworth,
teaches that ... filtration and stabilization steps be carried out
simultaneously." (Id., emphasis omitted).
The Examiner concluded the claimed invention would have been
obvious in view of the teachings of either Wedlock or BASF' s "60th
Anniversary of Povidone." According to the Examiner:
In view of BASF's "601h Anniversary of Povidone," it
would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to melt
extrude (i.e., compound/mix) known filtration aids, such as the
polyolefins, polypropylene or polyethylene taught by Van Den
Eynde, for example, with PVPP, to practice the invention of
Butterworth and/or Van Den Eynde, in order to obtain the
benefits Butterworth extols.
(Id. at 12, emphasis omitted).
4

Appeal2014-006990
Application 10/398,179

Wedlock teaches the melt extrusion of PVP with active
ingredients followed by subsequent milling. In view of the
teachings of Wedlock, it would have been obvious to one
skilled in the art to melt extrude (i.e., compound/mix) known
filtration aids (as taught by AAP A for example) or active
ingredients, such as the polyolefins, polypropylene or
polyethylene taught by Van Den Eynde, for example, with
PVPP, to practice the invention of Butterworth and/or Van Den
Eynde, in order to obtain the benefits [of] Butterworth.
(Id. at 13, emphasis omitted).

Appellants argue there is no suggestion of the desirability of
compounding the different components together and comminuting the
compounded product. (App. Br. 6-8). Appellants also argue:
The rejection is in error since both 601h Anniversary and
Wedlock disclose the compounding of soluble PVP - not
insoluble PVPP - with other substances. The combined
teachings of the cited prior art fail to suggest the reactive
compounding of PVPP with any other substance.
f A - - D - '7\
v-~1-'1-'· Ill. I)·

Appellants further argue it is incorrect to equate compounding of PVP
(polyvinylpyrrolidone) with compounding of PVPP because the properties
of PVP and PVPP are totally different. (Id. at 8). In support of their
arguments Appellants rely on the declaration of Beatus Schehl4 and portions
of the Kollidon brochure. 5 (Id.).
As set forth above, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have
recognized that filtration and stabilization can be practiced together and that

Appeal2014-006990
Application 10/398,179

there would be reason to do so. Appellants do not dispute the finding that
Butterworth and Van Den Eynde teach that filtration and stabilization can be
practiced together and that there would be reason to do so. (Id. at 4-5).
Inasmuch as it is well settled that it is a matter of obviousness for one of
ordinary skill in the art to combine two or more materials when each is
taught by the prior art to be used together, we agree with the Examiner's
determination that the claimed invention would have been obvious. See KSR

Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 417 (2007). A person of ordinary
skill in the art desiring filtration and stabilization to occur at the same time
would have reasonably expected that a solid formulation comprising a
known filter aid and a known stabilizer would achieve this goal. "For
obviousness under§ 103, all that is required is a reasonable expectation of
success." In re O'Farrell, 853 F.2d 894, 904 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
Appellants argue Wedlock only discloses compounding agents with
PVP and does not suggest compounding PVPP with other substances
because the Kollidon brochure is evidence a person of ordinary skill in the
art "would be aware that the polymer class PVPP is simply not a form of
PVP." (App. Br. 9 n. 3).
Appellants' arguments lack persuasive merit. The Kollidon brochure
is a document that describes the BASF Kollidon® family of
polyvinylpyrrolidone. This document describes various classes of PVP
inclusive therein is a description of PVPP (which is cross-linked PVP). It is
further noted the Kollidon brochure discloses there is no recognizable
difference of the infrared spectra of PVP and PVPP. (Kollidon 11 and 131 ).
Infrared spectra is used to identify and study chemicals. Thus, a person of

6

Appeal2014-006990
Application 10/398,179

ordinary skill in the art, in light of the infrared spectra, would have expected
PVP and PVPP share similar chemical structure. Furthermore, 601h
Anniversary discloses PVP and PVPP share the capability of stabilizing
suspensions. (Pg. 4, left most column). 601h Anniversary also discloses
PVPP can be complexed with other biopolymers. (Id.). Thus, a person of
ordinary skill in the art would have reasonably expected that PVPP was
suitable for complexing with other polymers. A person of ordinary skill in
the art would have been capable of creating a solid formulation utilizing
known compounding and comminuting techniques. See In re Sovish, 769
F.2d 738, 743 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (skill is presumed on the part of one of
ordinary skill in the art); In re Bozek, 416 F.2d 1385, 1390 (CCPA 1969).
Wedlock is exemplary of these known processes. We observe that
representative appealed claim 22 does not specify any particular particle size
for the comminuted form of filter aid.
It further noted that Appellants have presented extensive arguments

regarding the compounding and comminuting of polystyrene with PVPP.
(App. Br. 6-17). In support of these arguments for patentability, Appellants
rely on the declaration of Dr. Beatus Schehl (signed February 20, 2012) and
the declarations of Dr. Marianna Pierobon (signed October 18, 2006 and
December 7, 2006). (App. Br. 11).
We have considered the Declaration of Dr. Schehl, but do not find it
persuasive of establishing patentability of the appealed subject matter.
Although factual evidence is preferable to opinion testimony, such testimony
is entitled to consideration and some weight so long as the opinion is not on
the ultimate legal conclusion at issue. While an opinion as to a legal

7

Appeal2014-006990
Application 10/398,179

conclusion is not entitled to any weight, the underlying basis for the opinion
may be persuasive. In re Chilowsky, 306 F.2d 908, 916 (CCPA 1962).
Some weight may be given to a persuasively supported statement of one
skilled in the art on what was not obvious to him (see In re Lindell, 3 85 F .2d
453, 456 (CCPA 1967) andin re Weber, 341F.2d143 (CCPA 1965)).
Here, Dr. Schehl has provided his opinion as to what a person of ordinary
skill in the art would have understood based upon consideration of the
present Specification, claims 22-38, the prior art cited in the present record
and the declaration of Dr. Pierobon, filed December 11, 2006. (Declaration

iii! 2, 5, 6 and 12).

Dr. Schehl, at paragraph 19 of his declaration, states,

based upon controlling the relative amounts of PS and PVPP, "[i]n my
opinion, such uniform treatment could not be readily achieved using a
combination of filter granules and stabilization granules." However, the
claimed invention encompasses mixtures comprising wide-ranging amounts
of PS and PVPP. Dr. Schehl has not provided an explanation of why he
believed the result obtained in the experiments provided by Dr. Pierobon
were unexpected. Moreover, as established on the present record, the
claimed reactive compounding includes physical mixing of the reagents.
We have considered the Declarations of Dr. Pierobon. The evidence
presented is not commensurate in scope with the claimed invention.
Specifically, sample D, which is representative of the claimed invention, is
limited to a ca. 2: 1 weight ratio of PS and PVPP in the form of a compound
having mean particle size of D (v, 0.5) = 45 µm. (Declaration iJ 3). Claim
22 encompasses 20-95% by weight of PS and 80-5% by weight of PVPP
and does not disclose a mean particle size. A showing of unexpected results

8

Appeal2014-006990
Application 10/398,179

must be reasonably commensurate in scope with the degree of protection
sought by the claims on appeal. In re Grasselli, 713 F.2d 731, 743 (Fed.
Cir. 1983); In re Clemens, 622 F.2d 1029, 1035 (CCPA 1980). Dr. Pierobon
has not provided an explanation why this limited showing is representative
of the entire scope of the claimed invention.
For the reasons stated above we affirm the prior art rejection of claims
22-38 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).

ORDER
The rejection of claims 22-38 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136.
