THE INVENTION
The disclosed and claimed invention is directed to a panoptic
visualization document collection.
Claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject
matter:
1.
An apparatus for implementation of a panoptic
visualization document collection system, the apparatus
comprising a processor and a memory storing executable
instructions that in response to execution by the processor cause
the apparatus to implement at least:
a document parser configured to receive and disassemble
one or more electronic documents into a plurality of constituent
document components each of which includes respective media
content, the documents being disassembled according to a
predetermined type of the documents;
a colligater coupled to the document parser and configured
to colligate the document components, including for each of one
or more document components of the plurality, the colligater
being configured to:
identify one or more lirJ<:s bet\'l/een the document
component and one or more other document components
of the plurality, the one or more links being identified
according to one or more of the documents, type of
documents, or media content of the document component
and one or more other document components; and in
metadata according to some metadata schema and
associated with the document component,
provide structured infomlation identifying the one
or more links between the document component and one
or more other document components, and including a
unique identifier for each of the one or more other
document components,
wherein the colligater is further configured to
communicate the document components and metadata as a
panoptic visualization document collection; and

ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejection in light of Appellants'
arguments that the Examiner erred. In reaching this decision, we have
considered all evidence presented and all arguments made by Appellants.
We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments regarding claims 1-22.
Claims 1, 8, 15, and 22
Whether The Prior Art Discloses The Claimed Metadata
Appellants argue the Examiner erred in finding Boose teaches
metadata identifying "links between the document component and one or
3

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
more other document components" and "a unique identifier for each of the
one or more other document components," as recited in claim 1. App. Br. 8;
Reply Br. 2--4. More specifically, Appellants argue Boose only teaches that
"an original drawing sheet may be reviewed, as a legacy graphic file 22, to
identify objects in the drawing sheet, which objects may then be contained in
a reference object file. Boose also discloses that a source sheet may be
linked to a target sheet." App Br. 8. Appellants also argue even if Boose
teaches a unique identifier, it is not "the claimd [sic, claimed] invention in
which the structured information in the metadata includes a unique identifier
of other document component(s) (alleged to correspond to Boose's
drawing sheets)." Id.
The Examiner finds "Boose explicitly discloses creating links between
electronic files based on the media content of the file." Non-Final Act. 5
(citing Boose 7:25--41). The Examiner further finds Boose teaches creating
a metadata file that includes information about those links in extensible
markup language. Id. (citing Boose 10:8-22). Additionally, the Examiner
finds Boose teaches an object id to identify objects with a unique identifier
and that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
time of the invention to combine a unique identifier for the links to the
teachings of Horvitz and Boose in order to prevent the problems associated
with having conflicting identifiers. Id.; Ans. 18, 19.
We are not persuaded by Appellants arguments that the Examiner
erred. Instead, we agree with and adopt the Examiner's findings. Boose
teaches a method for "performing automated linking between sheets of a
drawing set." Boose 7:26--42. Boose further teaches a file that "contains all
the reference designators, off-sheet references, elements, components, and
4

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
packets of information identified by the reference recognizer 24 and the
features added by the reference object generator 26, as described below."
Boose 10:8-22 (emphasis omitted). Based on the broadest reasonable
interpretation of metadata, that file contains metadata and the links discussed
above. Finally, although Boose does not explicitly disclose using a unique
identifier "for each of the one or more other document components," as
recited in claim 1, Boose teaches using unique identifiers (Boose 11 :9--45)
and would have at least suggested to a person of ordinary skill in the art
using that unique identifier for the other document components to avoid
problems associated with using the same identifier for multiple objects.

Whether The Obvious To Try Rationale Was Conclusory
Appellants argue the Examiner erred in finding an ordinarily skilled
artisan would have found it obvious to try modifying Horvitz and Boose.
App. Br. 8-9. Although Appellants acknowledge that claims can be obvious
under§ 103(a) if it would have been "obvious to try" the proposed
combination, Appellants argue the Examiner improperly relied on
conclusory statements without an articulated reasoning. Id.
Appellants also argue in the Reply Brief that the Examiner's finding
in the Answer providing a more detailed reason should be treated as a new
ground of rejection. Reply Br. 4. Appellants further argue that even if the
modification proposed by the Examiner were made, it would not result in the
claimed invention.
We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments that the Examiner
erred. In the Answer, the Examiner expanded upon the finding of why a

5

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
person of ordinary skill in the art would modify the Horvitz/Boose
combination to include unique identifiers:
The use of an unique identifier to reference a document would
have been obvious to try because conflicting identifiers or
variables has generally been a problem in the computer science
field well before the time of the current invention. In other
words, are generally links or variables unique at least to their
scope. In other words, if identifiers for a group of variables is
generate in the form of names, a predictable solution would be to
create unique or different names for each variable.
Accordingly it would been obvious to try "unique identifiers" for
document components.
Ans. 19. The Examiner's finding of a reason to modify the teachings of the
references is supported by "some articulated reasoning with some rational
underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness." In re Kahn,
441F.3d977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006), cited with approval in KSR Int'! Co. v.
Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007).

Additionally, we do not address Appellants' contention that the
Examiner's finding of a reason to modify should have been designated a
new ground of rejection. Any request to designate the Answer a new ground
of rejection "must be by way of petition to the Director," and any failure to
do so within two months and before the filing of the Reply Brief "will
constitute a waiver of any arguments that a rejection must be designated as a
new ground of rejection." 37 C.F.R. § 41.40(a). The time for filing such a
petition has passed and the request is waived.
Finally, to the extent Appellants' argument that the modification
relied on by the Examiner does not teach the claimed invention (Reply Br. 4)
is commensurate with the argument raised in the Appeal Brief, we
previously found that argument unpersuasive. To the extent Appellants raise
6

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
a new argument in the Reply Brie±: because it was presented for the first
time in the reply brief, it has been waived. Optivus Technology, Inc. v. Ion
Beam Applications S.A., 469 F.3d 978, 989 (Fed. Cir. 2006); accord Ex
parte Borden, 93 USPQ2d 1473, 1473-74 (BPAI 2010) (informative

opinion) (absent a showing of good cause, the Board is not required to
address an argument newly presented in the reply brief that could have been
presented in the principal brief on appeal); 37 C.F.R. §41.41(b)(2) (same).

Whether There Was A Rationale For Modification Of The Prior Art
Appellants argue that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not
have combined Boose and Horvitz because "Boose' s system alone purports
to solve the cited need, and without any combination with Horvitz" and
"Horvitz appears to already address the same drawbacks addressed by Boose
(i.e., searching and browsing large amounts of information to identify items
of interest), which suggests that one skilled in the art would not have been
led to Boose." App. Br. 9
We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments that the Examiner
erred. Contrary to Appellants' arguments, in KSR International Co. v.
Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 417 (2007), the Supreme Court held that "if a

technique has been used to improve one device, and a person of ordinary
skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the
same way, using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is
beyond his or her skill." 550 U.S. at 417. Moreover, we agree with the
Examiner that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have modified
Horvtiz with the teaching of Boose because "Boose discloses a need 'for a
system that efficiently creates the intelligent graphic linking between
7

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
common elements depicted on different drawing sheets,'" and the
combination of the teachings of the references would "create a more
efficient linking system." Ans. 20 (citing Boose 2:65---67). The fact that
Horvitz may have provided a solution does not mean that the person of
ordinary skill in the art would not consider better or different alternatives.
According! y, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1, along
with the rejections of claims 8 and 15, which are argued on the same
grounds, and claim 22, which is not separately argued.
Claims 2-5, 9-12, and 16--19
Appellants argue the Examiner erred in finding Horvitz teaches the
additional limitations of the dependent claims because the Examiner noted
Horvitz does not teach links:
Dependent Claims 2-5 recite various specific manners according
to which link( s) between a document component and other
document component( s) are identified. For each of these claims,
the Examiner cites Horvitz as disclosing the recited features.
Appellants note that the Examiner already concedes that Horvitz
does not disclose identifying links according to independent
Claim 1 (and similarly independent Claims 8 and 15). Office
Action of Sep. 30, 2014, pp. 5, 7 and 9-10. Appellants
respectfully submit that if Horvitz does not disclose identifying
links as per the independent claims, Horvitz cannot reasonably
disclose the specific manners of identifying littles as per Claims
2-5.
App. Br. 10.
Nonobviousness cannot be established by attacking the references
individually when the rejection is predicated upon a combination of prior art
disclosures. In re Merck & Co. Inc., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986).
The test for obviousness is not whether the claimed invention is expressly

8

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
suggested in any one or all of the references, but whether the claimed subject
matter would have been obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art in light
of the combined teachings of those references. In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413,
425 (CCP A 1981 ). Because Appellants arguments are directed to Horvitz
individually and not the combined teachings of the references-specifically
the combination of Horvitz and Boose as discussed with regard to claim 1we are not persuaded by Appellants arguments that the Examiner erred.
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 2-5, 9-12,
and 16-19.
Clams 6, 13, and 20

Appellants argue the Examiner erred in finding Horvitz and Boose
teach or suggest the additional limitations of claims 6, 13, and 20. App. Br.
10-11. Specifically, Appellants argue paragraph 28 of Horvitz does not
contain the additional limitations recited in the claims. Id. Appellants also
argue the Examiner did not address the rejection in the Examiner's Answer.
The Examiner finds that paragraph 3 6 of Horvitz teaches the
additional limitation of claims 6, 13, and 20. Non-Final Act. 12, 14, 16-17.
We are not persuaded of error because Appellants' argument does not
address the reasoning relied on by the Examiner (Non-Final Act. 12, 14, and
16-17) and, thus, does not adequately address the rejection on appeal.
Specifically, although the Examiner relies on paragraph 36 of Horvitz (id.),
Appellants do not address that paragraph. Instead, Appellants only address
paragraph 28. App. Br. 10-11.
Nor are we persuaded that the Examiner's failure to specifically
respond to Appellants' argument in the Answer is relevant to whether or not
9

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
the Examiner erred in rejecting the claims in the Non-Final Action.
Appellants cite to MPEP 707.07([) (Reply Br. 7), which discusses the
contents of Office Actions. That is not applicable to the Examiner's Answer
in Appeal. Instead, the relevant sections of the MPEP states:
If there is a complete and thorough development of the issues at
the time of final rejection, it is possible to save time in preparing
the examiner's answer required by 37 CPR 41.39 by copying a
rejection from a prior Office action and then pasting the copied
rejection into the answer.

MPEP 1207 .2. Although the Examiner can add further explanation if
necessary, it is not required. Id. The Examiner's Answer included a copy of
the rejection of the claims. See Ans. 10, 12, 14--15. No more is required.
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 6, 13, and
20.
Claims 7, 14, and 21

With respect to dependent claims 7, 14, and 21, Appellants merely
contend that because the additional reference used in the rejection of those
claims (Gerhard) do not cure the shortcomings of the other references
applied against claim 1, the Examiner failed to make a prima facie case of
obviousness for these claims. App. Br. 11. Because we determine that the
rejection of claim 1 is not erroneous for the reasons discussed above, we
sustain the rejections of these claims.

10

Appeal2015-006666
Application 13/414,940
DECISION
For the above reasons, we affirm the Examiner's decisions rejecting
claims 1-22.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
