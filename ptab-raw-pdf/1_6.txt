Schmidt discloses:
By the binding of one or several detectable groups to an
aromatase inhibitor, surprising advantages are achieved
by the invention. Firstly, an increased aromatase activity
may represent an early occurring factor in tumor
formation, which is very valuable for a desired early
diagnosis of abnormal or pathological conditions. Since
the estrogen supply of the tumor is prenominantly [sic]
based on local synthesis, the aromatase enzyme is
enriched in the tumor. In addition, the tumor tissue
induces an enhanced generation of aromatase in its
surroundings, so that the tumor and its surroundings are
characterized by substantially more aromatase molecules
than the surrounding healthy tissue.

Doi discloses: "The rapid methylation and fluoromethylation

on aryl and alkenyl carbon frameworks by reacting methyl and fluoromethyl
iodide with aryl and alkenyl boronates have been studied with the focus on
the realization of the synthesis of [11 C]CH3 and [18F]FCH2 labeled positron
emission tomography (PET) tracers." Doi 4165.

Doi discloses "this boron protocol provides a firm chemical

basis for the synthesis of 11 C and 18F-incorporated PET tracers." Id.
6.

Doi discloses: "Since synthetic methods for a variety of boron

compounds have recently been developed due to the increased importance of
these compounds in the synthesis of the carbon frameworks of complex
natural products and artificial drug candidates, we can use organoboron
chemistry for the synthesis of a PET tracer." Id. at 4168---69.

C]Celecoxib([ 11 C]-10), a clinically important COX-2
inhibitor, was successfully synthesized by using the
corresponding pinacol arylborate under PET conditions
in high yield. These methods will be applicable to the
synthesis of ingenious [ 11 C]CH3- and [18F]FCH2incorporated heteroaromatic PET tracers, [ 11 C]-11 and
18

REJECTION OF CLAIMS 1, 5-7, 10, AND 11 AS OBVIOUS OVER
OKADA IN VIEW OF SUZUKI, SCHMIDT, OKADA II, AND/OR DOI
Appellants argue claims 1, 5-7, 10, and 11 together as a group. We
designate claim 1 as representative for claims 1, 5-7, 10, and 11.
The Examiner found that Okada taught an aromatase inhibiting
compound represented by the formula:

~~
N"

~N
NC~

Ans. 4 (hereafter, "the Okada Compound"). The Examiner determined,
however, that Okada did not teach a compound where X 1 is

11

CH3, CH2 18F,

or CF2 18F, as recited in claim 1. Id.
The Examiner found that it would have been obvious to "incorporate
an 11 C or 18F at the methyl position of the Okada Compound because it
would advantageously enable a predictable aromatase binding PET

6

Appeal2015-003921
Application 13/381,078
radiotracer for early stage diagnosis of pathological conditions, such as
tumor formation." Id. at 14. The Examiner found the motivation for this
substitution in Schmidt, which taught that "increased aromatase activity may
represent an early occurring factor in tumor formation, which is very
valuable for an early stage diagnosis of abnormal and pathological
conditions." Id. The Examiner found that the means to make this
substitution were provided by Suzuki and/or Doi, both of which taught
"rapid Pd-catalyzed coupling of [11 C]Mel and [18F]FMel into PET tracer."
Id.
Appellants argue that none of the cited art teaches a method for
synthesizing the starting compound necessary to perform the rapid Pdcatalyzed coupling reaction of Suzuki and Doi. App. Br. 10. Appellants
thus contend:
[W]hile Suzuki et al. in view of Doi et al., arguably
teaches that it would be possible for a person skilled in
the art to carry out a reaction represented by:

neither Suzuki et al. nor Doi et al. disclose or suggest a
procedure to obtain the starting compound for such a
reaction:

Id. at 10-11. Appellants further contend that "the Examiner has not pointed
to anything within Schmidt et al. that suggests any motivation for one of

7

Appeal2015-003921
Application 13/381,078
skill in the art to modify the compositions of Okada et al. (1997) to arrive at
the presently claimed compounds." Id. at 13.
Based on the record before us, we find that the Examiner has the
better position. Doi discloses that its methylation and fluoromethylation
method has broad applicability, providing a "firm chemical basis for the
synthesis of 11 C and 18F-incorporated PET tracers." FF5. 8 Doi further
suggests that methods for synthesizing the boronate precursor compounds
used in its method are known. See, FF6 ("synthetic methods for a variety of
boron compounds have recently been developed" allowing the "use [of]
organoboron chemistry for the synthesis of a PET tracer."). Doi also
provides an example in which its method was used to incorporate an 11 C
label in a COX2-inhibitor compound having the below formula.

FF7; Doi 4169.
Appellants do not identify any evidence or provide any argument
explaining why a person of ordinary skill in the art would be unable to use
the method of Doi to incorporate an 11 C and 18F label in the Okada
Compound. Instead, Appellants find fault with the Examiner's analysis,
contending that the Examiner failed to sufficiently identify a method for
obtaining the precursor compound to be used for applying the method of Doi
8

Doi and Suzuki both disclose similar methods of rapid palladium catalyzed
labeling of PET tracers. See, FF7 and FF12. To simplify our analysis, we
focus principally on one reference, Doi.
8

Appeal2015-003921
Application 13/381,078
to the Okada Compound. App. Br. 10 ("the Examiner has not
demonstrated ... "); see also, App. Br. 11 ("the Examiner has not pointed to
anything ... "). We are not persuaded. The Examiner provided evidence of a
labeling method taught to be broadly applicable to PET tracers. FF5.
Appellants provide no persuasive argument or evidence to support a
conclusion that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be unable to
synthesize the necessary precursors for Doi's methylation and
fluoromethylation method. This is particularly true given Doi's suggestion
that methods of synthesizing boronates were known. FF6.
To the extent there is something unique about synthesis of the
particular boronate precursor needed to use Doi' s methylation and
fluoromethlyation method on the Okada Compound that places its synthesis
outside the skill of the ordinary artisan, Appellants are in the better position
to provide evidence to this effect. See, In re Antor Media Corp., 689 F.3d
1282, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("an examiner, who has no access to experts or
laboratories, is not in a position to test each piece of prior art for enablement
in citing it, and requiring him to do so would be onerous, if not impossible'}
Appellants contend that the prior art does not provide a motivation to
"modify the compositions of Okada et al. ( 1997) to arrive at the presently
claimed compounds." App. Br. 13. We disagree. Okada teaches that the
Okada Compound is an aromatase inhibitor. FF 1. And Schmidt teaches that
"[b ]y the binding of one or several detectable groups to an aromatase
inhibitor, surprising advantages are achieved." FF3. Most significantly,
using a labeled aromatase inhibiting compound may allow for "early
diagnosis of abnormal or pathological conditions." Id. We find that this

9

Appeal2015-003921
Application 13/381,078
teaching would provide sufficient motivation to modify the Okada
Compound with a detectable group like an 11 C or 18F label.
Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner's rejection of claim 1 as
unpatentable over Okada, in view of Suzuki, Schmidt, Okada II, and/or Doi.
Because they were not argued separately, claims 5-7, 10, and 11 fall with
claim 1.
REJECTION OF CLAIMS 1, 2, AND 4 AS OBVIOUS OVER OKADA II
IN VIEW OF SUZUKI, SCHMIDT, OKADA, AND/OR DOI
Appellants argue claims 1, 2 and 4 together as a group. We designate
claim 1 as representative for claims 1, 2 and 4.
The Examiner's rejection of claims 1, 2 and 4 differs from the
Examiner's first obviousness rejection (rejecting claims 1, 5-7, 10, and 11)
principally in that the Examiner relied on a different starting compound. In
rejecting claims 1, 2 and 4, the Examiner relied upon the aromatase
inhibiting compound disclosed in Examples 13 and 34 of Okada II
(reproduced below) as starting compounds. Final Act. 8-9.

CH:i

CPJ

Example 13 (above left) discloses "4-[N-(4-methylbenzyl)-N-( 4nitrophenyl)amino ]-4H-1,2,4-triazole." Okada II, col. 20, 11. 12-13.
Example 34 (above right) discloses "4-[N-(4-cyanophenyl)-N-[( 4trifluoromethyl)benzyl]-amino ]-4H-1,2,4-triazole." Id. at col. 33, 11. 45--46.
The Examiner determined that it would have been obvious to modify the
compounds of Examples 13 and 34 to incorporate an 11 C or 18F at the methyl
10

Appeal2015-003921
Application 13/381,078
(or trifluoromethyl) position for the reasons discussed in connection with the
Examiner's first obviousness rejection. Final Act. 8-9; Ans. 15.
Appellants argue that claim 1, 2 and 4 are non-obvious for the same
reasons that claims 1, 5-7, 10, and 11 are non-obvious. App. Br. 13-14.
For the reasons discussed with respect to claims 1, 5-7, 10, and 11,
Appellants' arguments do not persuade us that a preponderance of the
evidence fails to support the obviousness of claim 1 over Okada II, in view
of Suzuki, Schmidt, Okada and/or Doi. Because they were not argued
separately, claims 2 and 4 fall with claim 1.
REJECTION OF CLAIMS 8, 9, 12, AND 13 AS OBVIOUS OVER
TAKASHINI IN VIEW OF OKADA, SUZUKI, SCHMIDT, OKADA II,
AND/OR DOI
Appellants argue claims 8, 9, 12, and 13 together as a group. We
designate claim 8 as representative for claims 8, 9, 12, and 13.
Claims 8, 9, 12, and 13 add limitations relating to methods of
diagnosis using a compound of claim 1. To address these additional
limitations, the Examiner relied upon Takashini, which the Examiner found
to teach "methods of diagnosing aromatase linked disorders comprising
administering labeled aromatase inhibitor." Ans. 10. Appellants argue that
claims 8, 9, 12, and 13 are non-obvious for the same reasons that claims 1,
5-7, 10, and 11 are non-obvious. App. Br. 14--15. For the reasons discussed
with respect to claims 1, 5-7, 10, and 11, Appellants' arguments do not
persuade us that a preponderance of the evidence fails to support the
obviousness of claim 8 over Takashini in view of Okada, Suzuki, Schmidt,
Okada II, and/or Doi. Because they were not argued separately, claims 9,
12, and 13 fall with claim 8.

survnvIARY
For these reasons and those set forth in the Examiner's Answer, the
Examiner's final decision to reject claims 1, 2, and 4--13 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § l.136(a)(l).
