MELISSA A. RAAP ALA, Administrative Patent Judges.
RAAP ALA, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Appellants have requested rehearing of the decision entered June 22,
2016, which affirmed the Examiner's decision to reject claims 1-8 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a). We have considered Appellants' arguments, and we are
not persuaded that any matters were misapprehended or overlooked in our
Decision. Therefore, the request for rehearing is denied.

Appeal2014-007936
Application 12/738,019
DISCUSSION
A request for rehearing "must state with particularity the points [of
law or fact] believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked by the
Board," and must comply with 37 C.F.R. § 41.52(a)(l) (2012). Appellants'
request for rehearing is limited to a whether our Decision overlooked certain
arguments in rendering the decision. Req. Reh'g 1. Specifically, Appellants
argue the Decision did not acknowledge or address Appellants' arguments
that the prior art does not teach or suggest "including within [an] XML
document one or more information elements identifying only service
conditions that [a] subscriber can change" ("including" limitation). Id. at 23. Appellants additionally reiterate their argument that HP OpenCall is the
only reference asserted as teaching the claimed information elements and
argue that our Decision never acknowledged or addressed the substance of
this argument. Id.
As noted by Appellants (Req. Reh'g 4), our Decision acknowledged
Appellants' argument regarding HP OpenCall. See Dec. 3. However,
contrary to Appellants' contention that we did not address the substance of
the argument, we did address the argument and found it unpersuasive. See
id.

In particular, Appellants misapprehend the Examiner's findings by
arguing that HP OpenCall is the only reference asserted as teaching the
claimed information elements. Our Decision explains the Examiner's
findings, with which we agreed, that AAP A teaches the claimed
informational elements in the XML document. Dec. 3 (citing Ans. 16-17);
see AAPA 2:26-3:3; 3:26-4:2 (describing information elements in an XML

document that a subscriber can change). Our decision further explains that

2

Application 12/738,019
the Examiner relies on Kelly to teach filtering (suppressing or removing
information that is unnecessarily redundant or not requested) to present to
the user and allow the user to interact only with service offerings allowed in
a profile. Dec. 3. Thus, the Examiner relied on the combination of AAP A
with Kelley-not HP OpenCall-to teach or suggest the "including"
limitation. See Dec. 3--4; see also Ans. 21 ( ("[T]he combination of AAP A
with Kelley teaches or suggest [the including limitation]."). Appellants
failed to address the Examiner's findings that the combination of AAP A and
Kelley teaches or suggests the "including" limitation. 1 See App. Br. 6-7;
Reply Br. 2-3. Our Decision considered all of the arguments presented by
Appellants-including the argument that HP OpenCall is the only reference
asserted as teaching the claimed informational elements-and found them to
be insufficient to persuade us the Examiner erred in finding the combination
of AAP A and Kelley teaches or suggests the "including" limitation. See
Dec. 3--4.
For the reasons stated above, Appellants have not shown we
misapprehended or overlooked any issue of fact or law in our Decision.

CONCLUSION
We have granted Appellants' request for rehearing to the extent that
we have reconsidered our Decision entered June 22, 2016. Appellants have

Appellants did present arguments pertaining to Kelley, but we were not
persuaded by those arguments. See Dec. 3--4. Moreover, we observe one
cannot show non-obviousness by attacking references individually where, as
here, the rejections are based on combinations of references. In re Keller,
642 F.2d 413, 426 (CCPA 1981).

not shown that we misapprehended or overlooked any issue of law or fact in
reaching that Decision. Accordingly, the request is denied.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.

§ 41.50(±).
