Before DONALD E. ADAMS, TIMOTHY G. MAJORS and
DAVID COTTA, Administrative Patent Judges.
COTT A, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 involving claims to a method
of improving the stability of a tablet comprising a pharmaceutically active
ingredient. The Examiner rejected the claims on appeal as obvious under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a).
We affirm.

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is McNeil-PPC, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. App. Br. 2.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Claims 15-26 are on appeal. Claim 15 is illustrative and reads as
follows:
15. A method of improving the stability of a tablet, wherein
the tablet comprises a pharmaceutically active ingredient,
the method comprising the step of:
combining the pharmaceutically active ingredient
in a matrix comprising directly compressible dextrose
monohydrate and sucralose;
wherein the improvement in stability is evidenced
by a reduction in browning or discoloration in the tablet.
The Examiner rejected claims 15-26 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over the combination of Boissonneault, 2 Brouillard3 and Olmo 4
or over the combination of Boissonneault, Valentine, 5 Brouillard and Olmo.
The Examiner also rejected claims 15-26 on the ground of
obviousness-type double patenting over claims 1-14 of U.S. Patent No.
6,814,978 in view of Boissonneault and Valentine. Appellants do not
address the Examiner's double patenting rejection. We therefore summarily
affirm the obviousness-type double patenting rejection. See Manual of
Patent Examining Procedure § 1205.02.

ANALYSIS
Appellants address the Examiner's obviousness rejections. Because
the issues raised on appeal are the same with respect to both combinations of
prior art, we will address both obviousness rejections together as well.
Appellants argue claims 15-26 as a group. We designate claim 15 as
representative of the group.
The Examiner found that Boissonneault taught a chewable tablet
composition comprising, inter alia, an active ingredient, dextrose, and
sucralose. Ans. 5. Boissonneault, however, does not disclose the use of
dextrose monohydrate in its chewable tablet. Id.
The Examiner found that Brouillard taught that dextrose hydrate,
when employed in direct compression, "produces a cooling effect when
dissolved in the mouth, which is highly desirable for a tableted food or a
pharmaceutical and can also enhance the flavor in the tablet (col. 2, L 1035); particularly chewable dn1g tablets (coL 5; []L 55-58)." Id at 5---6. The
Examiner also found that Olmo taught that tablets prepared with Emdex
(hydrated dextrose) had higher mechanical strength and faster disintegration
than tablets prepared with Maltrin (fine granules of maltodextrine ). Id. at 6.
Finally, the Examiner found that Valentine taught that dextrose and dextrose
monohydrate were "equally effective for compressibility." Id. at 7. Based
on these teachings, the Examiner concluded:
It would have been obvious for one of an ordinary skill in
the art at the time of the instant invention was made [] to
include the particulate agglomerated carbohydrates or
granules such as dextrose monohydrate (of Valentine or
[]Brouillard or Olmo et al) in the composition of
Boissonneault for preparing directly compressed tablets
because Valentine teach that dextrose and dextrose

3

Appeal2015-003941
Application 13/030,273
monohydrate are equally effective for compressibility,
the tablets are highly compressible and also the tablets
readily dissolve in minimal amounts of water in the
mouth thus quickly liquefying [] the active agent.
Further []Brouillard also teach that dextrose monohydrate
particles disintegrate very quickly in the mouth and
enhance the flavor of the tablet. Olmo also teaches
directly compressible dextrose monohydrate with high
strength and faster disintegration.
Id.
Appellants assert that the claimed method is based on the "discover[y]
that when sucralose is used as the high intensity sweetener, sucralose does
not react with dextrose in the presence of increased levels of water. As such,
tablets formulated with sucralose and dextrose monohydrate do not exhibit
discoloration or browning." App. Br. at 6. Appellants contend that prior to
this discovery, "[m]any skilled in the art believe[d] that the use of high
intensity sweeteners in combination with dextrose monohydrate lead[] to the
browning and/or discoloration issue," and that this belief "would have
stopped those skilled in the art from combining dextrose monohydrate with a
high intensity sweetener." App. Br. at 5.
The Examiner has the better position. Boissonneault exemplifies a
tablet for delivering an active pharmaceutical ingredient - an oral
contraceptive - comprising dextrose and sucralose. Boissonneault col. 11,
11. 27-43 (Example 6). The prior art provides motivation to substitute
dextrose monohydrate for dextrose for the reasons discussed by the
Examiner. In particular, the prior art teaches that "dextrose hydrate
produces a cooling effect when dissolved in the mouth, which can be highly
desirable for tableted food or pharmaceutical products," Brouillard col. 2, 11.

29-3 6, and that hydrated dextrose has both higher mechanical strength and
faster disintegration than Maltrin maltodextrin. Olmo 777.
Appellants contend that the potential for compositions comprised of
dextrose monohydrate and high intensity sweeteners to "exhibit
discoloration and browning as the tablets age" would have discouraged the
use of dextrose monohydrate together with sucralose. 6 We are not
persuaded. Given the art recognized benefits of dextrose monohydrate
discussed above, we find that a person of ordinary skill in this art would
have been motivated to replace dextrose with dextrose monohydrate in
formulations that comprise a pharmaceutically active ingredient, dextrose,
and sucralose. See e.g., Boissonneault col. 11, 11. 27-43 (Example 6).
Therefore, absent persuasive evidence or argument to the contrary, we find
that the benefits of dextrose monohydrate taught in the art would have
outweighed any potential concerns regarding browning or discoloration.
We also find that Appellants reliance on the recitation of some
amount of a "reduction in browning or discoloration in the tablet" in claim
15 for patentability is misplaced. 7

advantage which would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the

We note that the only evidence of discoloration or browning is provided by
the Specification, which states: "Conventional high intensity sweeteners,
such as aspartame, when combined with dextrose monohydrate, result in age
related browning or discoloration." Specification p. 2, 11. 14--15.
1
In this regard, we note that Appellants' claimed method does not require
the absence of browning or discoloration of a tablet, but instead merely
requires some, however small, degree of a reduction in the browning or
discoloration in the tablet.

otherwise be obvious."); see also, In re I-iuai-I-iung Kao, 639 F.3d 1057,
1072 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (''merely discovering and claiming a new benefit of an
old process cannot render the process again patentable"); In re Woodruff,
919 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990 ("It is a general nde that merely
discovering and claiming a new benefit of an old process cannot render the
process again patentable.").
Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner's rejection of claim 15 as
unpatentable over the combination of Boissonneault, Brouillard and Olmo or
over the combination of Boissonneault, Valentine, Brouillard and Olmo.
Because they were not argued separately, claims 16-26 fall with claim 15.
SUMMARY
For these reasons set forth in the Examiner's Answer, as emphasized
above, the Examiner's final decision to reject claims 15-26 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l).
