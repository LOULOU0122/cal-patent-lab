23

(Paper 245).

24
25

The general subject matter
The subject matter claimed by the parties relates to “exon skipping.” Exon

26

skipping is a molecular biology technique that may be useful for ameliorating or

27

eliminating the effects of certain genetic mutations. Those mutations may result in
2

1

a shift in the reading frame during protein formation resulting in a non-functional,

2

or partially functional, protein. The exon skipping technique, in effect, hides

3

certain pre-mRNA exons from the mRNA formation machinery. As a result, the

4

hidden exon is removed along with introns during the splicing to form mRNA.

5

The exon skipping is said to be caused by the binding of an oligonucleotide that

6

includes a nucleobase sequence that is complementary to a portion of a particular

7

pre-mRNA exon. The complimentary oligonucleotide is referred to as an antisense

8

oligonucleotide or “AON.” Both the exon to be discarded and the AON are chosen

9

to restore an open reading frame allowing for the formation of a more complete

10
11

and more functional protein.
Specifically, the parties’ invention is directed to AONs selected to cause

12

skipping of exon 51 of the pre-mRNA associated with the gene responsible for the

13

formation of the protein dystrophin. The absence of dystrophin prevents skeletal

14

muscle development and causes the myopathies of muscular dystrophy. In people

15

suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the mutation in the

16

dystrophin gene essentially precludes the formation of any functional dystrophin.

17

By skipping, and thus removing, exon 51 during the formation of mRNA, a

18

reading frame is said to be restored, resulting in the formation of a partially

19

functional dystrophin protein.

20

UWA’s Motion 3 – 35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1)

21

The Board may take up motions for decision in any order. 37 C.F.R.

22

§ 41.125(a). Because a motion alleging that an opponent’s claims were untimely

23

made under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1) raises a possible threshold issue, we address

24

UWA’s Motion 3 first. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.201, definition of threshold issue.

25

UWA moves for a judgment against AZL’s involved claims asserting that

26

they are barred under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1) for failing to have been made within

27

one year of the issuance of UWA’s involved patents. UWA Motion 3, Paper 215.
3

1

AZL responds arguing that its current claims are supported by pre-critical date

2

claims in its parent applications 12/198,007 and 11/233,495. AZL Opposition 3,

3

Paper 397.

4

We grant UWA’s motion.

5

AZL’s involved claims

6

AZL’s involved application includes Claims 11, 12, 14, 15, 17-29.

7

Claims 11, 15, 19 and 26 are independent. Each of the claims is directed to AONs

8

defined partially by structure and partially by function. We reproduce

9

representative Claim 11 below, with paragraphing and bracketing added:

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18

21

11. An isolated antisense oligonucleotide of 20 to 50
nucleotides in length, comprising
a morpholino ring
[1]wherein said oligonucleotide is capable
[a] of binding to an exon-internal sequence of
exon 51 of the human dystrophin pre-mRNA
and
[b] inducing exon skipping,
[2] wherein h51AON1
(UCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCU) (SEQ ID NO:
27) is capable of binding to said
exon-internal sequence.

22

AZL Clean Copy of Claims, Paper 8, 1:3-7. The independent claims, and by

23

incorporation-by-reference each of the dependent claims, include the limitations

24

italicized above. h51AON1 is the designation given by AZL’s inventors to a

25

20 nucleotide AON having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27. Ex. 1009, p. 44. It is

26

said to be capable of causing exon skipping of exon 51 of human dystrophin pre-

27

mRNA. Id.

28

AZL’s claims require that the AONs satisfy two functional “capable of

29

binding” limitations: (1) The AONs must be capable of binding to an exon-internal

30

sequence of exon 51 of the pre-mRNA (limitation [1][a] above) and (2) the AON
4

1

designated as h51AON1 must be capable of binding to the same exon internal

2

sequence to which the AON binds ([2] above). We shall refer to these two

3

requirements as the “dual-binding limitation.” In addition, the AONs encompassed

4

by the claims must cause exon skipping ([1][b] above). We refer to this limitation

5

as the “exon-skipping limitation.”

6

Analysis

7

Under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1) (pre-AIA) applicants are barred from obtaining

8

claims to subject matter that is the same or substantially the same as subject matter

9

claimed in a patent unless the applicant made those claims within one year of the

10
11
12
13
14

issuance of the patent:
A claim which is the same as, or for the same or substantially
the same subject matter as, a claim of an issued patent may not
be made in any application unless such a claim is made prior to
one year from the date on which the patent was granted.

15

35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1) (2010). The statute codifies a legal principal similar to

16

laches by imposing what effectively is a statute of limitations on interferences to

17

make a patentee more secure in the patent property right. In re Berger, 279 F.3d

18

975, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Where an applicant makes a claim that is directed to the

19

same or substantially the same subject matter as a patent claim more than a year

20

after the patent issued, the applicant must show that it had support for the claimed

21

subject matter in claims filed before the one-year critical date. Regents of the

22

Univ. of Cal. v. Univ. of Iowa Research Found., 455 F.3d 1371, 1374

23

(Fed.Cir.2006). The applicant must establish that the later filed claims do not

24

differ from the pre-critical date claims in any material limitation. Id. The subject

25

matter of multiple pre-critical date claims, taken together, may be relied upon to

26

show that the subject matter of the pre-critical date claims does not differ

27

materially from the subject matter of the post-critical date claims. Pioneer Hibred

28

Int’l, Inc. v. Monsanto Tech. LLC, 671 F.3d 1324, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Those
5

1

earlier claims must demonstrate an intent to claim an invention including all the

2

material limitations of the later filed claims. Id. However, a material limitation

3

need not be explicitly expressed in the earlier claims so long as the material

4

limitation is inherent, i.e., “necessarily results” from other limitations in the claim.

5

Berger, 279 F.3d at 983. The fact that the material limitation is disclosed in the

6

written description of a pre-critical date specification or drawing is not relevant.

7

See id. (“As our precedent makes clear, ‘[t]he inquiry here is not whether such a

8

step is inherently disclosed, as it might be in a right-to-make case. Rather, the

9

question is whether the step necessarily occurs in the process as claimed.’”).

10

One indicia of a material limitation is that the limitation was necessary for

11

patentability. A limitation is presumed to be material if it was added in response to

12

a rejection and resulted in allowance. Adair v. Carter, 668 F.3d 1334, 1339 (Fed.

13

Cir. 2012) (“When an applicant adds limitations in response to an examiner's

14

rejection, and those limitations result in allowance, there exists a well established

15

presumption that those limitations are necessary to patentability and thus

16

material.”)

17

Relevant Dates

18

UWA’s involved ’541 patent issued on June 14, 2011. Ex. 1002, p. 1.

19

UWA’s involved ’816 patent issued October 5, 2010. Ex. 1001, p. 1. Thus, the

20

critical date for § 135(b)(1) purposes is October 5, 2011. 35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1).

21

AZL’s involved application was filed on July 16, 2012. Ex. 1009, p. 1. AZL’s

22

involved claims were placed into their final and current form by an amendment

23

filed on May 12, 2014. Ex. 2064, pp. 2-4; Ex. 2076, p. 4.

24

AZL does not argue that its involved claims and UWA’s involved claims are

25

not directed to the same or substantially the same subject matter. Thus, at least

26

facially, AZL’s claims were “made” after the critical date.

6

1

Materiality.

2

UWA says the following, present in all of AZL’s claims, are material

3
4
5
6
7
8

limitations:
wherein said oligonucleotide is capable of binding to an exoninternal sequence of exon 51 of the human dystrophin premRNA and inducing skipping of exon 51 and wherein
h51A0N1 (UCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCU) (SEQ ID
NO: 27) is capable of binding to said exon-internal sequence.

9

UWA Motion 3, Paper 215, 5:5 – 6:5. These are the dual-binding and exon-

10

skipping limitations we identified above. The limitations were first added to

11

AZL’s involved application, subsequent to the critical date, by the amendment of

12

May 12, 2014. Ex. 2064.

13

In UWA’s view, the limitations are material because they were added to

14

overcome the examiner’s rejections of the claims and are therefore “necessary to

15

patentability.” “When an applicant adds limitations in response to an examiner’s

16

rejection, and those limitations result in allowance, there exists a well established

17

presumption that those limitations are necessary to patentability and thus material.”

18

Adair, 668 F.3d at 1339 (citing Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki

19

Co., 535 U.S. 722, 734 (2002)). See also, Parks v. Fine, 773 F.2d 1577, 1579

20

(Fed. Cir. 1985) (“The insertion of this limitation to overcome the examiner’s

21

rejection is strong, if not conclusive, evidence of materiality.”)

22

We turn to the prosecution of AZL’s involved claims to determine whether

23

the identified limitations were necessary to patentability and thus should be

24

presumptively considered material. As we noted above, both the dual-binding

25

limitation and the exon skipping limitation are present in all of AZL’s involved

26

claims. AZL Clean Copy of Claims, Paper 8. The limitations were added to

27

independent Claims 11, 15 and 19 by the amendment of May 12, 2014. Ex. 2064.

28

Independent Claim 26, which was newly added by the same amendment also
7

1

included both limitations. Ex. 2064, p. 4. We will focus on the prosecution of

2

AZL Claim 11 as representative of the prosecution of AZL’s involved claims.
At the time the examiner first considered AZL’s ’210 application, it included

3
4

16 claims, 1-16.1 Ex. 2062, pp. 2-3. Claim 11 stated:

5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

11. (New) An isolated antisense oligonucleotide of 20 to 50
nucleotides in length,
said oligonucleotide comprising a sequence which is
complementary to a target nucleic acid sequence of exon 51 of
the human dystrophin pre-mRNA,
wherein the target nucleic acid sequence comprises a
nucleotide sequence that is complementary to the sequence
UCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCU (SEQ ID NO: 27).

13

Ex. 2062, p. 3. The claim does not include the dual-binding and exon-skipping

14

limitations.

15

Claim 11 as well as the other claims were rejected on a variety of different

16

grounds including : (1) obviousness (Claims 1-16); (2) anticipation (Claims 1, 2,

17

6. 7, 8-12 and 16) (3) double patenting (Claims 1-16); indefiniteness (Claims 1-

18

10), (4) lack of written description (Claims 6 and 16). Ex. 2080, pp. 2-11. In

19

response to the rejection, on January 21, 2014, AZL filed an amendment,

20

cancelling claims 1-10, 13 and 16, amending Claims 11, 12, 14 and 15, and

21

adding Claims 17-25. Ex. 1052, pp. 2-3. On May 9, 2014, before the examiner

22

acted on the amendment, AZL’s counsel had an interview with the examiner.

23

Ex. 2076, p. 2. During the interview, the examiner indicated that the amended

24

claims filed January 21, 2014, were unpatentable because they introduced new

25

matter. Id. However, the examiner also indicated that proposed amended claims
The ’210 application is said to be a continuation of Application 12/976,381. As
originally filed, the ’210 specification included 3 claims. Those claims were
replaced in a pre-amendment with claims 1-10. A subsequent pre-amendment,
filed before the examiner considered the application, amended dependent claims 210 and added Claims 11-16. Ex. 2062, pp. 2-3.
8
1

1

presented during the interview would be allowable. Id. Following the interview,

2

on May 12, 2014, AZL filed a supplemental amendment apparently in conformity

3

with the claims discussed during the interview. Ex. 2064. The supplemental

4

amendment further amended Claims 11, 12, 15, 17-19 and 23-25 and added

5

Claims 26-29, bringing the claims to their present allowable form. Ex. 2064,

6

pp. 2-4; Ex. 2076, p. 4. For the first time, the claims included the dual-binding

7

and exon-skipping limitation. Ex. 2064, id. The examiner determined that those

8

claims were patentable, but for the outcome of the interference, and suggested that

9

an interference be declared with UWA’s patents. Ex. 2076, p. 4.

10

In the table below we compare Claim 11 as originally presented in the

11

’210 application with the allowed version with differences shown italicized:
Claim 11 as originally added by the
amendment of January 13, 2013.
Ex. 2062, p. 3.
11. (Original) An isolated antisense
oligonucleotide of 20 to 50 nucleotides
in length,
said oligonucleotide comprising
a sequence which is complementary to
a target nucleic acid sequence of exon
51 of the human dystrophin premRNA,
wherein the target nucleic acid
sequence comprises a nucleotide
sequence that is complementary to the
sequence
UCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCU
(SEQ ID NO: 27).

Claim 11 from the amendment of
May 12, 2014, and as allowed by the
Examiner. Ex. 2064, p. 2.
11. (As allowed) An isolated antisense
oligonucleotide of 20 to 50 nucleotides
in length, comprising
a morpholino ring[2]
wherein said oligonucleotide is
cable of binding to an exon-internal
sequence of exon 51 of the human
dystrophin pre-mRNA and
inducing exon skipping,
wherein h51AON1
(UCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCU)
(SEQ ID NO: 27) is capable of binding
to said exon internal sequence.

The “morpholino ring” serves as the backbone of the AON. Each of AZL’s
independent claims recite a different backbone. The recitation of the specific
backbone has not been asserted to be a material difference between the pre-and
post-critical date claims.
9
2

1

We find from the above-described prosecution history that the claims were

2

not considered allowable until AZL added the functional dual-binding and exon

3

skipping limitations to overcome the examiner’s objections. AZL does not argue

4

to the contrary. The dual-binding limitations and the “capable of inducing exon

5

skipping” are, therefore, presumptively material. Adair, 668 F.3d at 1339.

6

Pre-critical date support

7

AZL argues that the limitations are supported by pre-critical date claims in

8
9
10

its ’007 and ’495 applications.
Burden of Proof on pre-critical date support
AZL argues that it is UWA’s burden to demonstrate “that each of AZL’s

11

post-critical date claims contains material limitations which were not explicitly or

12

inherently present in AZL’s pre-critical date claims.” AZL Opposition 3,

13

Paper 397, 5:10-12.

14

AZL is incorrect. While the overall and ultimate burden of persuasion with

15

respect to UWA Motion 3, is and remains with UWA (37 C.F.R. § 41.121(b)), the

16

initial burden is met when the motion is supported by appropriate evidence that, if

17

unrebutted, would justify the relief sought. 37 C.F.R. § 41.208(b). Here the

18

evidence shows that the subject matter of AZL’s involved claims was first made

19

after the critical date. UWA has also identified material limitations and explained

20

why those claims are material. UWA Motion 3, Paper 215, 5:5 – 6:5. AZL has

21

not contested that its involved claims are directed to the same or substantially the

22

same subject matter as UWA’s claims. Where it has been established that the

23

subject matter of the applicant’s claims was first made after the critical date, the

24

opponent must show that its post-critical date claims are “not materially different

25

from a pre-critical date claim present in the application or any predecessor thereto

26

in order to obtain the benefit of the earlier filing date . . . .” Adair, 668 F.3d at

27

1339. In other words, while UWA bears and maintains the overall burden of
10

1

persuasion with respect to the motion and the bar under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1),

2

AZL bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of pre-critical date support for

3

the post-critical date claims: “To establish entitlement to the earlier effective date

4

of existing claims for purposes of the one-year bar of 35 U.S.C. § 135(b), a party

5

must show that the later filed claim does not differ from an earlier claim in any

6

‘material limitation.’ ” In re Berger, 279 F.3d at 981–82 (Fed. Cir. 2002) quoting

7

Corbett v. Chisholm, 568 F.2d 759, 765–66 (CCPA 1977) (emphasis added.).

8
9

Application 12/198,007
AZL argues that Claim 20 of its involved application is supported by pre-

10

critical date Claims 1 and 2 of its grand-parent ’007 application. AZL

11

Opposition 3, 19-23. Claim 20 depends from independent Claim 19. Claim 19

12

and, thus, Claim 20 each require the presumptively material dual-binding

13

limitation as well as the exon-skipping limitation. Claim 2 of the ’700 application

14

depends from Claim 1. We present a side-by-side comparison of the pre- and post-

15

critical claims below with the differences in subject matter italicized:

According to AZL, one skilled in the art would not consider the differences

2

between the pre and post-critical claims to be material. AZL Opposition 3,

3

Paper 397, 19: 3 – 23:12. The effect of the limitations, says AZL, is merely to

4

narrow the scope of the claims to include only AONs that cause exon-skipping:

5

AZL Opposition 3, Paper 397, 22:16 – 23:2. AZL directs us to the testimony of

6

Dr. Erik Sontheimer for support. Id. He testifies that
12

1
2
3
4

7
8

a person of skill in the art would understand that the combined
function of these three limitations is to narrow the scope of [the
claims of the involved application] to include only
oligonucleotides which cause exon-skipping, thus excluding the
small fraction of inoperative oligonucleotides from what was
covered in the pre-critical date claims.
Ex. 1186, ¶ 81, 23:22-25.
We simply do not see the relevance of this argument to whether the

9

amendments added material limitations. We fail to see why, under the facts of the

10

prosecution of the AZL’s involved application, narrowing the scope of the claims

11

in response to the examiner’s rejections, and thereby putting the claims in

12

condition for allowance, was not necessary to patentability. Indeed, such an

13

amendment would seem to be an example of a limitation “necessary to

14

patentability.” See Adair, 668 F.3d at 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“When an applicant

15

adds limitations in response to an examiner's rejection, and those limitations result

16

in allowance, there exists a well established presumption that those limitations are

17

necessary to patentability and thus material.”). Dr. Southeimer does not explain

18

why one skilled in the art would consider a limitation that narrowed the scope of

19

the claims in response to the examiner’s rejections and overcame the Examiner’s

20

rejections would not be considered “necessary to patentability” and, therefore, not

21

a material limitation.

22

Additionally, we do not credit Dr. Sontheimer’s testimony that the effect of

23

the added limitations was simply to eliminate inoperative/non-skip-causing

24

species. Ex. 1186, ¶¶ 70-81. Eliminating the inoperative species could have been

25

accomplished simply by requiring that the oliognucleotide induce exon skipping.

26

However, the addition of the dual-binding limitation significantly broadened the

27

claim scope to include AONs having sequences that are not included in the cited

28

pre-critical date claims. AZL directs us to Claims 1 and 2 from its
13

1

’007 Application. AZL Opposition 3, Paper 397, 20:9-28. In relevant part those

2

Claims 1 and 2 of the ’007 application require:
“An isolated oligonucleotide of between 20 to 50 nucleotides
comprising a sequence consisting of SEQ ID: 27.”

3
4
5

AZL Opposition 3, Paper 397, 20:21-23. The AONs covered by those claims

6

must “comprise,” and therefore must include, the complete set of the twenty

7

nucleotides of SEQ ID: 27 (h51AON1), but do not require inducing exon

8

skipping. All of AZL’s involved claims, while narrower than its earlier claims in

9

requiring inducing exon skipping, are broader in not requiring all 20 nucleotides

10

of h51AON1 to be present in the covered AONs. All that is required is the AON

11

include some unspecified number of the nucleotides of h51AON1 sufficient to be

12

“capable of binding” to the same “exon internal sequence” to which the AON

13

binds. Dr. Sontheimer’s testimony to the effect that the differences between the

14

pre- and post-critical date claims was simply narrowing the scope of the claims is

15

inconsistent with the broadened language of AZL’s involved claims. His

16

testimony is also conclusory in that he does not provide an explanation why one

17

skilled in the art would understand the limitations to simply “exclude the small

18

fraction of inoperative oligonucleotides.” We therefore do no credit his testimony

19

on this point.

20

AZL has not established that the differences between Claims 1 and 2 of its

21

pre-critical date ’007 application and its involved claims are not material

22

differences.

for its involved claims. AZL argues that the material limitations are explicit or

Claims of Application 11/233,495, Ex. 1222, pp. 2, 4, 9-10

29

We held above that AZL’s dual-binding limitation was presumptively

30

material. Assuming, without deciding, that the subject matters of AZL Claims 15,

31

26 and 70 of the ’495 application are sufficiently related to be combined for the

32

purposes of § 135(b)(1), we are not convinced that the dual-binding concept is

33

either explicitly present or is inherent in the subject matter of those claims.

34

Claims 15, 26 and 70 are product by process claims. Central to the subject

35

matter of those claims is the process of designing an AON that is at least partially
16

1

complementary to the open and closed secondary structure of a number of exons

2

including exon 51. AZL’s involved claims do not include the process of utilizing

3

the exon secondary structure to identify, determine and design the appropriate

4

AONs. AZL Clean Copy of Claims, Paper 8. In addition to the steps of

5

determining, designing and generating certain AONs, Claim 70 adds that the

6

AONs must include the sequence of one of a number of AONs including h51AON.

7

That AON includes the full twenty nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID

8

NO:27. Claims 15 and 70 further specify that binding of the AONs alters the

9

splicing of the pre-mRNA. Claim 26 is directed to the method of inducing exon

10
11

skipping by “providing” the AON of Claim 15.
A comparison of Claim 15, 26 and 70 of the ’495 application and AZL’s

12

involved claims shows that the latter claims express and encompass a concept and

13

subject matter not present in the pre-critical date claims. AZL’s current claims

14

require the dual-binding limitation. This, in our view, is a significantly different

15

and broader concept than that conveyed by an AON that must include the twenty

16

nucleotide sequence of h51AON1 encompassed by Claim 70 or the aggregate of

17

that claim with Claims 15 and 26 of the ’495 application. AZL has not explained

18

where those claims, either alone or in aggregate, explicitly express the dual-

19

binding concept that the AON must be capable of binding to an exon internal

20

sequence and the h51AON must be able to bind to that same sequence.

21

AZL also argues that the dual-binding limitation is inherent in the

22

’495 application claims. AZL Opposition 3, Paper 397, 6:17 – 9:16. In order to

23

show that the material limitations are inherent in the earlier claims, it must be

24

shown that those limitations are necessarily present in the earlier claims. Berger,

25

279 F.3d at 983. In other words, the material limitations of AZL’s involved claims

26

must necessarily result from the limitations of Claims 15, 26 and 70 of the ‘495

27

application. AZL’s involved claims require the dual-binding limitation.
17

1

We are not convinced that these limitations necessarily result from AZL’s

2

earlier claims. The combination of Claims 15, 26 and 70 of the ’495 application

3

reasonably show an intent to claim AONs, that bind to exon 51 (Claim 15), that

4

include the complete 20 nucleotide sequence of h51AON1 (SEQ ID NO:27)

5

(Claim 70), and that induce exon skipping (Claim 26). However, the dual-binding

6

limitation present in all of AZL’s involved claims embodies a significantly

7

different and broader concept. Those claims include AONs that are capable of

8

binding to an exon-internal sequence of exon 51 but need only have sufficient

9

nucleotide similarity with an unspecified number of the twenty nucleotides of

10

h51AON1 such that h51AON1 is also capable of binding to the same exon-internal

11

sequence to which the AON binds. Unlike the pre-critical date claims, the AONs

12

of the involved claims do not require that the complete twenty nucleotide sequence

13

of h51AON1 be present in the AONs.

14

With respect to the dual-binding concept, AZL argues:

15
16
17
18
19
20

A person of skill in the art would immediately understand,
based on the known sequence of exon 51, the sequence
specified in SEQ ID NO: 27, and the rules of Watson-Crick
base pairing, that h51AON1 (SEQ ID NO: 27) inherently binds
to the sequence 5’-AGAAAUGCCAUCUUCCUUGA-3’ on the
pre-mRNA of exon 51.

21

AZL Opposition 3, Paper 397, 9:6-9. We do not disagree with this statement.

22

However, AZL has not explained why its broader dual-binding limitation

23

necessarily flows from the fact that the h51AON1 binds with its complementary

24

pre-mRNA.

25
26
27
28

AZL also argues that
every oligonucleotide defined by the aggregate of pre-critical
date claims 70, 15 and 26, which must include h51AON1 (SEQ
ID NO: 27) as part of its sequence, would inherently satisfy the

18

limitation that “h51AON1 (UCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCU)
(SEQ ID NO: 27) is capable of binding to said exon-internal
sequence.

1
2
3
4

AZL Opposition 3, Paper 397, 9:12-15. In other words, with respect to h51AON1

5

the subject matter of AZL’s involved claims is said to be generic to the aggregated

6

subject matter of pre-critical date claims 15, 25 and 70. While we agree that

7

h51AON1 would likely meet the dual-binding and exon-skipping limitations, we

8

fail to see how those claims necessarily include and convey possession of the dual-

9

binding concept. As noted above, there is a difference in scope with respect to the

10

AONs encompassed by the involved claims and those AONs that must include the

11

complete twenty nucleotide sequence of h51AON1 of the pre-critical date claims.

12

AZL has not adequately explained why this difference in scope between the

13

h51AON1 containing AONs of, for example, Claim 70 of the ’495 application, and

14

the broader scope of AZL’s involved claims does not constitute a material

15

difference.

16
17

We are not convinced that AZL has shown that the dual-binding limitation is
supported by Claims 15, 26 and 70 of AZL’s ’495 application.

18

Conclusion

19

We grant UWA’s Motion 3.

20

As a result of the decision granting UWA’s Motion 3, all of AZL’s claims

21

are barred under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b)(1). The absence of an interfering claim that is

22

not barred under § 135(b) renders an interference nonexistent, and thus deprives

23

the Board of its authority to continue the proceeding. Berman v. Housey, 291 F.3d

24

1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002). See also, Parks v. Fine, 773 F.2d 1577, 1581

25

(Fed.Cir.1985) (vacating the Board's award of priority because Fine's claims were

26

barred under § 135(b), and concluding that “[t]he interference being dissolved,

19

1

there is no occasion to award priority to either party”).3 Accordingly, we do not

2

reach the other motions and a judgment will be issued against AZL in a separate

3

paper.
