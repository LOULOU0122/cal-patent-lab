Appeal2015-007283
Application 14/155,008 1
Technology Center 2400

Before MARC S. HOFF, JOHN P. PINKERTON, and JOYCE CRAIG,
Administrative Patent Judges.
HOFF, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from a Final Rejection of
claims 1-14. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We affirm.

1

The real party in interest is Fortinet, Inc.

Appeal2015-007283
Application 14/155,008
Appellants' invention is a method and system for improved attack
context data logging. Configuration information is received by a firewall
device from a network administrator, including a number (N) of packets to
capture by the firewall device responsive to an event detected by the firewall
device. The detected event is potentially indicative of a threat or undesired
activity. Responsive to a determination that a trigger packet is associated
with a potential threat or potential undesired activity, the firewall device
causes information regarding N packets of the received packets, inclusive of
the trigger packet, to be stored in a log. See Abstract.
Claim 1 is exemplary of the claims on appeal:
1.

A method comprising:

receiving, by a firewall device, configuration information
from a network administrator, the configuration information
including a number (N) of packets to capture by the firewall
device responsive to an event detected by the firewall device
that is potentially indicative of a threat or undesired activity;
rece1vmg, by the firewall device, a plurality of packets;
applying, by the firewall device, at least one attack
detection algorithm to the plurality of packets, wherein the at
least one attack detection algorithm comprises one or more of a
set of intrusion detection signatures, a set of malware detection
signatures and a set of security policies; and
responsive to determining, by the firewall device, based
on the at least one attack detection algorithm that a trigger
packet of the plurality of packets is associated with a potential
threat or potential undesired activity, causing information
regarding N packets of the plurality of packets, inclusive of the
trigger packet, to be stored in a log.
App. Br. 18 (Claims App'x).

Appeal2015-007283
Application 14/155,008
The Examiner relies upon the following prior art in rejecting the
claims on appeal:
Xie et al.
McGrath et al.

US 2007 /0050846 Al
US 2012/0140630 Al

Mar. 1, 2007
June 7, 2012

Claims 1-14 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Xie and McGrath.
Throughout this decision, we make reference to the Appeal Brief
("App. Br.," filed Jan. 14, 2015), the Final Action ("Final Act.," mailed Oct.
31, 2014), and the Examiner's Answer ("Ans.," mailed May 22, 2015) for
their respective details.

ISSUES
1. Did the Examiner err in combining Xie and McGrath because
McGrath constitutes nonanalogous art?
2. Does the combination of Xie and McGrath disclose or suggest
receiving configuration including a number (N) of packets to capture by the
firewall device responsive to an event detected by the firewall device that is
potentially indicative of a threat or undesired activity?
PRINCIPLES OF LAW
The analogous-art test requires that the Board show that a
reference is either in the field of the applicant's endeavor or is
reasonably pertinent to the problem with which the inventor
was concerned in order to rely on that reference as a basis for
rejection .... References are selected as being reasonably
pertinent to the problem based on the judgment of a person
having ordinary skill in the art.

Application 14/155,008
ANALYSIS
ANALOGOUS ART

Appellants' argument that McGrath is not analogous art to
Appellants' invention is not persuasive. See App. Br. 10-13. The problem
that Appellants are concerned with is "logging data to facilitate capturing
and understanding of the context of an attack." Spec. i-f 3. Appellants,
therefore, seek to learn from an attack and apply that learning to prevent or
lessen future attacks. McGrath is concerned with detecting "unwanted data
reception," just as Appellants are (i.e., with "attacks"), and filtering out said
unwanted data in order to keep its resource constrained electronic devices
from being "overwhelmed by deliberate (or accidental) excessive network
traffic." McGrath i-fi-1 4, 11. Just like Appellants, McGrath is concerned with
reducing or eliminating the impact of attacks.
We conclude that McGrath is reasonably pertinent to the problem with
which the inventor was concerned, based on the judgment of a person having
ordinary skill in the art.
COMBINATION OF XIE AND MCGRATH

The Examiner finds that Xie discloses "receiving ... configuration
information from a network administrator, the configuration information
including parameters to capture by the firewall device responsive to an event
detected by the firewall device that is potentially indicative of a threat or
undesired activity." Final Act. 3--4 (citing Xie i-fi-132-34, 41). The Examiner
further finds that Xie discloses "causing information regarding N packets of
the plurality of packets, inclusive of the trigger packet, to be stored in a log."
Final Act. 4 (citing Xie i-fi-132, 33, 35).

Appeal2015-007283
Application 14/155,008
Xie discloses that firewall 21 is part of its logging device, and logged
data is sent to a storage device 22. See Xie i-fi-130-32.
[T]he user can also specify the depth of logging. For example,
the user can set the parameters so that only headers of the data
packets are logged. Alternatively, the user can set the
parameters to log the full content or only the session related
data (length of the data). For example, the user may request
that only the headers of the IP packets are logged and to log the
entire packets for all other types of packets.
Xie i133. "[T]he firewall 21 serves as a filter recognizing the format of the
packet and selecting the packets that are to be logged onto the storage 22."
Xie i1 34. "That is, the firewall 21 selectively decides which network
packets are to be stored in the storage 22 based on the user specified criteria
and which packets can go through without the logging." Xie i135.
We find that the user in Xie may vary a number of criteria that
determine which and how many network packets are logged in storage 22.
We find that Xie' s disclosure of the option to log "the full content" or "the
entire packets" equates to a user's option to simply log a predetermined
number of (full) packets to storage 22.
McGrath discloses a method to limit the amount of network traffic by
detecting unwanted data reception and discarding unwanted data reception
before it reaches another higher layer of the network stack of an electronic
device. See McGrath i-f 11. We agree with the Examiner's finding that
McGrath "switch[ es] on filtering [i.e., discarding unwanted data reception]
dependent on the number of data packets received per unit time according to
at least one predetermined number of data packets." McGrath i-f 17.
Given Xie' s extensive disclosures concerning how a user may
configure parameters concerning the logging of received packets to storage,

5

Appeal2015-007283
Application 14/155,008
and given McGrath's disclosure that protective action is taken when
unwanted data is received, we agree with the Examiner's conclusion that it
would have been obvious to combine Xie and McGrath such that a firewall
device receives configuration information to the effect that N packets are to
be captured responsive to a detected threat or undesired activity. See Final
Act. 4. We agree with the Examiner's rationale that doing so would limit
the amount of network traffic reaching a local node. Final Act. 5.
We find that the combination of Xie and McGrath discloses or
suggests all the limitations of claims 1-14. We sustain the Examiner's§ 103
rejection of claims 1-14.

CONCLUSIONS
1. The Examiner did not err in combining Xie and McGrath.
McGrath does not constitute nonanalogous art.
2. The combination of Xie and McGrath suggests receiving
configuration including a number (N) of packets to capture by the firewall
device responsive to an event detected by the firewall device that is
potentially indicative of a threat or undesired activity.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejection of claims 1-14 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
