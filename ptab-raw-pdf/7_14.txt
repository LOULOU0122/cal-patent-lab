Appeal2015-002846
Application 13/238,281
The claims are directed to an optical sensor system having shields, an
image forming apparatus having an optical sensor system having shields,
and a method for detecting volatile organic compounds comprising shields.
Claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:
1.

An optical sensor system, comprising:

a source module including a source housing unit having a
source window member and a source shielding member, the
source module to emit a detection signal through the source
window member;
the source shielding member surrounding the source
window member and extending in an outward direction from
the source window member; and
a detection module including a detection housing unit
having a detection window member and a detection shielding
member, the detection module to detect the detection signal
emitted from the source module at the detection window
member and spaced apart from the source module;
the detection shielding member surrounding the detection
window member and extending in an outward direction from
the detection window member;
wherein distal ends of the source shielding member and
the detection shielding member are spaced from and opposed to
each other.
App. Br. 19 (Claims App'x).

Application 13/238,281
REJECTIONS
Claims 1-10 and 18-20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as
anticipated by Furtaw. Claims stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
follows: claims 11-16 over Furtaw in view ofKuhnell; and claim 17 over
Furtaw in view of Kuhnen and further in view of Chopra.
OPINION
The application contains three independent claims: claims 1, 11,
and 18. Claim 1 is drawn to an optical sensor system comprising a source
and a detection module, each of which comprises a shielding member
"wherein distal ends of the source shielding member and the detection
shielding member are spaced from and opposed to each other." App. Br. 19
(Claim App'x). Claim 11 is drawn to an image forming apparatus
comprising an optical sensor system including a source and a detection
module, each of which comprises a shielding member "wherein the source
shielding member and the detection shielding member are separate members
with free ends thereof opposed to each other." Id. at 21. Claim 18 is drawn
to a method of detecting volatile organic compounds, the method comprising
emitting a detection signal by a source module and receiving the detection
signal by a detection module spaced apart from the source module, wherein
the source module comprises a source shielding member having an open end
"spaced apart from and opposed to" a detection module, and a detection
module comprises a detection shielding member having an open end "spaced
apart from and opposed to" the source module.
Thus, claims 1 and 18 and their dependent claims require a source
shielding member and a detection shielding member that are "spaced apart

Application 13/238,281
from and opposed to" each other. Claim 11 requires the source shielding
member and detection shielding member are separate members with free
ends thereof "opposed to" each other. Appellants amended the claims on
November 6, 2013 to add these limitations in response to the Examiner's
rejection of the claims over Furtaw.

Application 13/238,281
In the Final Action and Answer, the Examiner maps elements of the
claims to Furtaw's Figure 1, which is reproduced below:

Figure 1 depicts a gas analyzer including a removable sample flow
cell (20) according to one embodiment of Furtaw.
The Examiner identifies element 60 of Furtaw as the source module of
the claims, element 50 as the detection module, element 70 as the source
window member (and an identical element, not shown, on the detection
module as the detection window member), and element 20 as both the
source shielding member and the detection shielding member. Ans. 2-3.

According to the Examiner, "[t]he distal end of the [source] shielding
member and the detection shielding [member] are spaced from and opposed
to each other by the body of the shielding member." Ans. 11-12. Thus, the
Examiner construes "opposed to" to mean "at opposite ends." The

5

Appeal2015-002846
Application 13/238,281
Examiner provides no citation to the Specification in support of this
construction; rather, the Examiner only cites Furtaw. See id.
Appellants argue that "opposed to" should be construed as "set or
placed in opposition to each other." App. Br. 10; Reply 4. This construction
is consistent with the Specification and figures of the application. See, e.g.,

i-fi-f 14--18, Figs. 2A, 2B. Appellants explain that, while the cylindrical
portions at the top and bottom of the removable sample cell in Furtaw may
be on opposite ends of the removable sample cell, these cylindrical portions
are not "opposed to" each other. App. Br. 10.
During examination, claims are to be given their broadest reasonable
interpretation consistent with the specification, and claim language should
be read in light of the specification as it would be interpreted by one of
ordinary skill in the art. In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359,
1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The Examiner's construction of "opposed to" as
meaning "at opposite ends" appears to be based on Furtaw, not the
Specification. The Examiner has not shown that the broadest reasonable
interpretation of "opposed to" consistent with the Specification is "at
opposite ends." In contrast, Appellants' construction provides the necessary
consistency with the Specification. We construe the term "opposed to" in
the claims as "set or placed in opposition to each other."
Rejection of claims 1-10 and 18-20 as anticipated by Furtaw

In light of our claim construction, we find that Furtaw fails to teach all
of the limitations of claims 1 and 18. Specifically, Furtaw does not teach
"wherein the distal ends of the source shielding member and the detection
shielding member are spaced from and opposed to each other" (claim 1), or
"with an open end of the source (detection) shielding member spaced from
6

Appeal2015-002846
Application 13/238,281
and opposed to the detection (source) module" (claim 18). Therefore, we do
not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 1 and 18 as anticipated by
Furtaw. We likewise do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of (1) claims
2-10 because those claims depend from claim 1, and (2) claims 19 and 20
because those claims depend from claim 18.

Rejections of claims 11-16 as obvious over Furtaw in view of
Kuhnel! and of claim 17 as obvious over Furtaw in view of
Kuhnel! and further in view of Chopra
The Examiner relies on Furtaw for the claim element "wherein distal
ends of the source shielding member and the detection shielding member are
spaced from and opposed to each other." Ans. 8. Because neither Kuhnen
nor Chopra teach this claim element, we find that the prior art cited by the
Examiner fails to teach all elements of claims 11 and 17. For this reason we
do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 11 and its dependent claims
12-16 as obvious over Furtaw in view of Kuhnell. We also do not sustain
the Examiner's rejection of claim 17 as obvious over Furtaw in view of
Kuhnen and further in view of Chopra.
DECISION
For the above reasons, the Examiner's rejection of claims 1-20 is
REVERSED.
REVERSED
