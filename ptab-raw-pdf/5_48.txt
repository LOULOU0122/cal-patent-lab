DECISION ON APPEAL

Appeal2015-000659
Application 12/714,241
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellant 1 appeals under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from a Final Rejection of
claims 1-15, which are all of the pending claims. We have jurisdiction
under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b ).
We reverse.

THE INVENTION
The application "relates to surface smoothing within an earth model of
a geological volume of interest." (Spec. 1:6-7.) Claim 1, reproduced below,
is illustrative:
1. A system for processing an earth model of a geological
volume of interest, the system comprising:
one or more processors configured to execute computer
program modules, the computer program modules comprising:
an earth model module for obtaining the earth model of the
geological volume of interest, wherein the earth model includes
a polygon mesh that describes a position of a surface within the
geological volume ofinterest, the polygon mesh being comprised
of planar polygons defined by three or more vertices, and the
earth model including positional coordinates for the vertices of
the polygons;
a dip module for determining values of the dip of the polygon
mesh within the earth model, wherein determining values of the
dip of the polygon mesh includes determining values of dip for
the individual polygons based on the positional coordinates of
the vertices defining the polygons;

a smoothing module configured to smooth the values of dip
along the polygon mesh without impacting the positional
coordinates for the vertices of the polygons.

THE REJECTIONS

1.

Claims 1, 3---6, 9, and 11-14 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.

§ 102(b) as anticipated by Godavarthy. (See Final Act. 3-7.)
2.

Claims 2 and 10 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C § 103(a) as

unpatentable over Godavarthy and Koren. (See Final Act. 8.)
3.

Claims 7, 8, and 15 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C § 103(a) as

unpatentable over Godavarthy and Deming. (See Final Act. 9-10.)

ANALYSIS
Claim 1 recites "a dip module for determining values of the dip of the
polygon mesh within the earth model, wherein determining values of the dip
of the polygon mesh includes determining values of dip for the individual
polygons based on the positional coordinates of the vertices defining the
polygons." Claim 9 similarly recites a method that includes "determining
values of the dip of the polygon mesh within the earth model, wherein
determining values of the dip of the polygon mesh includes determining

values of dip for the individual polygons based on the positional coordinates
of the vertices defining the polygons."
The Examiner finds these limitations in Godavarthy' s natural
neighbor interpolation ("NNI"), which "is a method for estimating the zvalue of an arbitrary point P from the z values of a set of points with known
z-values," where "[t]he z-value represents the elevation at the location on the
earth's surface to which the point on the [triangulated irregular network]
corresponds." (Godavarthy i-fi-133, 92; see Final Act. 4--5.) Godavarthy's
NNI "uses information in the Delaunay triangulation of the known points to
compute a weighted average of the z-values of the natural neighbors of P."
(Godavarthy i192.)
Appellant argues that the rejections are in error because
"Godavarthy' s resulting average or weighted average elevation value used to
interpolate a new surface point is not a value of dip, and no value of dip is
needed for Godavarthy's technique." (App. Br. 9.) We agree.
The Specification describes a system that includes a "dip module" that
"may be configured to determine values of the dip of the polygon mesh (e.g.,
polygon meshes 300 and 402) within the earth model provided by the earth
model module 110." (Spec. i-f 7:20-22.) The Specification explains that
"[d]ip is orientation with respect to a reference direction" and that "[f]or
example, dip may be described generally as the derivative of a surface
spatial function that defines a geological surface." (Id. at 22-24.)

Appeal2015-000659
Application 12/714,241
Consistent with the Specification, 2 we interpret "dip" to mean "orientation
with respect to a reference direction."
Although Godavarthy does teach a method for determining a value
that is "based on the positional coordinates of the vertices," the value it
computes is simply the z-value associated with an additional, interpolated
surface point, i.e., an interpolated elevation, not an orientation with respect
to a reference direction.
Because we conclude that Godavarthy does not describe the claimed
dip values, we decline to sustain the 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) rejection of
independent claims 1 and 9 and their dependent claims 3---6 and 11-14. And,
because the obviousness rejections are also premised on Godavarthy
teaching dip values, we also decline to sustain the rejections of claims 2, 7,
8, 10, and 15 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). We do not reach Appellant's
additional arguments.

DECISION
The rejections of claims 1-15 are reversed.

"During examination, 'claims ... are to be given their broadest reasonable
interpretation consistent with the specification, and ... claim language
should be read in light of the specification as it would be interpreted by one
of ordinary skill in the art." In re American Academy of Science Tech
