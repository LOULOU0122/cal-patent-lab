REJECTIONS
Claims 1-3 and 5-7 stand rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)
as being unpatentable over Brennan in view of Kishigami and Bonglovi.
Final Act. 2-6.

ANALYSIS
The Examiner has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of
obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445
(Fed. Cir. 1992). That burden requires the Examiner to demonstrate that the

Appeal2015-006314
Application 11/999 ,845
references used in rejecting the claims on appeal under§ 103(a) are
available as "prior art" under 35 U.S.C. § 102.
Here, the Examiner relies upon Bonglovi as a reference in rejecting all
of the claims on appeal. However, the Examiner does not demonstrate that
Bonglovi is available as "prior art" under 35 U.S.C. § 102. Specifically,
Bonglovi is not qualified as "prior art" under pre-AIA §§ 102(a) or (b)
because Bonglovi was published on April 23, 2009, which is after the
effective filing date of the instant Application, namely May 5, 2004. 2
Bonglovi is also not available as prior art under pre-AIA § 102(e) because
Bonglovi's earliest potential filing date is February 7, 2006, which is after
the effective filing date of the instant application.
Accordingly, we hold that the Examiner has failed to carry the burden
of establishing a prima facie case of obviousness of the subject matter
recited in claims 1-3 and 5-7 within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).

DECISION
For the above reasons, we reverse the Examiner's decisions rejecting
claims 1-3 and 5-7.

REVERSED

The instant application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S.
Application 10/839,954, which was filed on May 5, 2004. Spec. 1.
