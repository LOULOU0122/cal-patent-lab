EXEivIPLARY CLAiivI

1.
A method implemented by a restricted local access point
for determining output power for communication with mobile
stations in a cellular network, the method comprising:
scanning, by the restricted local access point, the cellular
network for determining broadcasting channels used by
surrounding wireless access points, wherein the restricted local
access point comprises a radio circuit which scans the cellular
network for determining broadcasting channels used by
surrounding wireless access points, and wherein the radio
circuit receives on frequencies corresponding to the broadcast
channels used by the surrounding wireless access points;
selecting, by the restricted local access point, a
broadcasting channel that receives a lowest disturbance from
surrounding access points, wherein the radio circuit is ordered
to broadcast on the selected broadcasting channel, and wherein
the radio circuit is a chipset having a form of a chipset from a
mobile station but is made to receive on frequencies
corresponding to the broadcast channels used by the
surrounding wireless access points and further made to
broadcast on the selected broadcasting channel;
varying, by the restricted local access point, the output
power of the selected broadcasting channel in order to provide a
desired relation to the lowest disturbance;
determining, by the restricted local access point, whether
a main disturbing access point is another restricted local access
point or an unrestricted global access point, and in case the
main disturbing access point is another restricted local access
point then further performing by the first restricted local access
point:
setting a threshold for one of a plurality of
quantities of the desired relation, which the quantity in
question is not allowed to pass;
varying the output power for providing the desired
relation without said quantity passing said threshold; and,

2

Appeal2015-006941
Application 14/134,697
selecting another channel if the desired relation
cannot be obtained without the quantity passing the
threshold; and
wherein the restricted local access point is one of
following:
a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)
restricted local access point; or
a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS) restricted local access point.
REJECTIONS ON APPEAL
Claims 1-8, 10-12, and 14--21 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103(a) as being unpatentable over Haartsen (US 5,794,157; Aug. 11,
1998), Batra (US 7,372,890 B2; May 13, 2008) ("Batra '890"), Rainnie
(US 7,672,695 Bl; March 2, 2010), and Wong (US 2005/0255892 Al; Nov.
17, 2005). Ans. 2-21. 1
Claim 9 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Haartsen, Batra '890, Rainnie, Wong, and Batra
(US 2004/0218683 Al; Nov. 4, 2004) ("Batra '683"). Ans. 22-23.
Claim 13 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Haartsen, Batra '890, Rainnie, Wong, and Paulraj
(US 6,377,636 Bl; Apr. 23, 2002). Ans. 22-23.

By an Amendment after the Final Action, claims 22-26 were canceled and
independent claims 1, 16, and 19 were amended to incorporate the canceled
subject matter. Amendment 10 (Nov. 24, 2014). The Answer revises the
rejections to account for the amendments. Clearly due to a typographical
error, the Answer incorrectly omits claims 20 and 21 from the statement of
the first rejection, but does include these claims in the body of the rejection.
See Ans. 20-21.

ANALYSIS
Appellants contend the independent claims require a local access
point that: both receives and broadcasts data on the same frequencies; and
operates under a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). App. Br. 9; Reply
Br. 2. Appellants further contend that an ordinarily skilled artisan would not
have, at the time of the present invention, viewed the Examiner's applied
prior art as teaching or suggesting the above features because GSM and
UMTS were understood as requiring access points to receive and broadcast
data over different frequencies. App. Br. 9-11; Reply Br. 3. In Appellants'
words:
[T]he claimed restricted local access point[,] per the GSM and
UMTS standards[,] would normally have to receive on a different
frequency band than it transmits on....
. . . [T]he claimed GSM/UMTS restricted local access point has
a specially configured chipset that has been made counter to the
requirements of the GSivI and UivITS standards to transmit and
receive on the same frequency rather than to transmit and receive
on different frequencies. Hence, the claimed restricted local
assess point is counter-intuitive (i.e., teaches away from the prior
art) and therefore patentable ....
App. Br. 9-10; see also Reply Br. 3. Appellants also quote portions of the
GSM and UMTS standards to support the assertion that both standards
implement access points receiving and broadcasting data over different
frequencies. 2 Appellants further argue that Wong teaches away from the
claimed invention, contending:
2

Appellants cite two websites as presenting the quoted portions of the GSM
and UMTS standards. The websites are no longer available and thus have
not been viewed by this panel. However, the quotations and citations have

Application 14/134,697
Applicant notes that the Examiner has stated "Wong teaches, in
Sections 0025, 0032, and 802.11 access point, which is the
restricted local access point, that has GSM capability and thus
having the capability to transmit and receive on different
frequencies (see Final Office Action's page 3, lines 1-8).
Hence, Wong teaches away from claim 1.
App. Br. 11. Appellants' arguments are not persuasive.
We agree with the Examiner that claim 1 does not specifically
indicate that the restricted local access point transmits and receives on the
same frequency. Adv. Act. 1. Rather, claim 1 requires the restricted access
point is made to receive on frequencies corresponding to the broadcast

channels used by the surrounding wireless access points, but does not
require its own selected broadcast channel to be on the same frequencies
used by the surrounding channels. The Examiner finds, and we agree, that
Haartsen teaches the claimed restricted access point that receives on
frequencies corresponding to broadcast channels used by the surrounding
wireless access points. Final Act. 3--4; see, e.g., Haartsen, col. 2, 11. 53-58,
col. 6, 11. 16-20. We are not persuaded that either Wong or the cited
portions of the GSM and UMTS standard teach away from combining the
teachings of Haartsen with Wong's teaching of a restricted access point with
GSM capability. To teach away, a reference must actually "criticize,
discredit, or otherwise discourage" investigation into the claimed solution.

In re Fulton, 391 F.3d 1195, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Appellants have not
shown that either the GSM and UMTS standards or Wong "criticize,

been presented twice before this appeal and twice for this appeal.
Amendment 12 (Nov. 24, 2014); Amendment 15 (July 16, 2014); App. Br.
10; Reply Br. 3. Thus, for the sake of compact prosecution, we assume
arguendo the quotations are accurate reproductions of the standards.

Application 14/134,697
discredit, or otherwise discourage" investigation into restricted access points
with GSM capability that are made to receive data on frequencies
corresponding to the broadcast channels used by surrounding wireless access
points. In particular, the cited sections of the GSM standard do not criticize
or discourage investigation into a restricted access point with GSM
capability receiving on additional frequencies (i.e., the broadcast frequencies
used by surrounding access points) than that specified by the standard. 3
Moreover, we observe that Haartsen explicitly indicates that its radio
communication system-which receives on frequencies corresponding to the
broadcast channels used by surrounding wireless access points-is
compatible with existing cellular standards like the Global System for
Mobile Communication (GSM). See Haartsen, col. 1, 11. 9-16.

For the reasons stated above, Appellants fail to persuade us of error in
the rejection of independent claims 1, 16, and 19. Accordingly, we sustain
the 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) rejections of claims 1, 16, and 19 and their dependent
claims 2-15, 17, 18, 20, and 21, for which Appellants do not present
separate arguments for patentability (see App. Br. 12).

3

We further observe that the limited excerpt of the GSM standard states
only that the "Standard or primary GSM 900 Band" operates at the specified
frequencies. See App. Br. 10. We are unable to ascertain from the limited
excerpt of the GSM standard whether or not the entire GSM standard is so
limited and/or whether other standards are used for restricted access points.

Application 14/134,697
DECISION
We affirm the Examiner's decision to reject claims 1-21.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.

§ 41.50(±).
