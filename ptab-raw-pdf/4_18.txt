The Invention

Appellants' disclosed invention relates to "data communications and,
more particularly, to ... search[ing] a data source based on compatibility
with an application." Spec. i-f 1 (2nd occurrence). Claim 1, which is
illustrative, reads as follows:
1.

A method comprising:
receiving a first query that includes keywords;

using a data processor to identify at least one keyword in
the first query as application information describing a first
application;
inferring remaining keywords in the first query as item
information that describes a first item that a user is searching
for on a network-based marketplace, the first item being a part
that is compatible with the first application; and
searching a data storage device, the searching including
identifying a first listing on the data storage device as matched,
the first listing including an item offered for sale on the
network-based marketplace and including listing item
information that matches the item information in the query, the

first listing further including listing application information that

The Rejection
Claims 1-20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as being
anticipated by Piper et al. (US 2007 /0219982 Al; Sept. 20, 2007) ("Piper").

The Record
Rather than repeat the arguments here, we refer to the Appeal Brief
("Br." filed Jan. 7, 2014) and the Specification ("Spec." filed Oct. 14, 2009)
for the positions of Appellants and the Final Office Action ("Final Act."
mailed June 6, 2013) and Examiner's Answer ("Ans." mailed May 8, 2014)
for the reasoning, findings, and conclusions of the Examiner. Only those
arguments actually made by Appellants have been considered in this
decision. Arguments that Appellants did not make in the Appeal Brief have
not been considered and are deemed to be waived. See 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.37(c)(l)(iv) (2013).

ISSUE
Claims 1-20 are subject to the same ground of rejection. Appellants'
patentability arguments directly address only claim 1. Br. 8-12. Therefore,
we select claim 1 as the representative claim, pursuant to our authority under
37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv). Accordingly, claims 2-20 stand or fall with
claim 1.
The issue presented by Appellants' contentions is as follows: Does
the Examiner err in finding Piper discloses "identify[ing] at least one
keyword in [a] first query as application information describing a first
application[, and] inferring remaining keywords in the first query as item

3

Appeal2015-005321
Application 12/579,404
information that describes a first item ... , the first item being a part that is
compatible with the first application" (the "inferring limitation"), as recited
in claim 1?

ANALYSIS
The Examiner finds Piper discloses the inferring limitation. Final Act.
2-3 (citing Piper i-fi-172, 79). Appellants contend because Piper uses an
automobile-part abbreviation dictionary to determine the "remaining
term(s)" of the query, Piper does not disclose "inferring remaining keywords
in the query as item information." See Br. 10-12. We agree with the
Examiner's findings.
A pertinent dictionary definition is: "in· fer ... v.t. 1. to derive by
reasoning; conclude or judge from premises or evidence . . . . 3. to guess;
speculate; surmise." THE RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE 978 (2nd ed. (unabridged) 1987). Therefore, the inferring
limitation of claim l requires identifying one or more keywords of a query
as application information, e.g., the make and model of a vehicle (see Spec.

i1 47), and judging from that evidence that one or more of the remaining
keywords of the query describe an item that is a compatible with the
application, e.g., a replacement part for the identified vehicle (see id.). We
note that the inferring limitation recites inferring remaining keywords as
item identifiers; it neither recites nor precludes inferring the identity of a
particular item from the item identifiers.
Piper discloses a process for determining from a user input string
(Piper i1 71, Figs. 7 (item 182), 8 (item 200) ) "which of the terms are for
identifying the model or possible models of automobile, and which are for
identifying the part or possible parts being sought" (Piper i1 72). Piper
4

Appeal2015-005321
Application 12/579,404
"first determine[ s] the vehicle model or possible models .... " (Piper i-f 72,
Figs. 7 (item 184), 8 (item 202).) Piper further discloses "determin[ing] the
automobile part or possible parts based on the remaining term(s)" (Piper

i-f 79) of the user input string. In other words, Piper discloses drawing the
inference that one or more of the terms of the user input string remaining
after identification of the model of the automobile, i.e., the recited
"application information," represents part information, i.e., the recited "item
information." That Piper uses an "automobile-part abbreviation dictionary"
(Piper i-f 79) to identify a specific part from the item information does not
obviate the Examiner's finding that Piper discloses inferring remaining
keywords as item information.
We find no error in the rejection of representative claim 1 as
anticipated by Piper. Accordingly, we sustain the rejection for anticipation
by Piper of claim 1 and claims 2-20, which fall with representative claim 1.

DECISION
The decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1-20 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l). See 37 C.F.R.
§§ 41.50(f), 41.52(b).
AFFIRMED
