THE INVENTION
Appellants' invention is directed to a device for treating bone in a
living body, and includes an implant and strain measuring sensors. Spec. i-f
2. Independent claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative:
1. A device for treating bone in a living body, comprising:
an implant configured for attachment to a bone;
a first sensor measuring a strain on a first portion of the implant,
the first portion of the implant being configured to be
mechanically coupled to a weakened portion of a bone when the
implant is coupled to the bone in a target position; and
a second sensor isolated between two bone fixation element
receiving holes of the implant measuring strain in a nonweakened portion of the bone.
THE REJECTIONS ON APPEAL
The Examiner has rejected:
(i)

claims 1-5, 7, 9-12, and 15-20 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as
being anticipated by Morgan '741 (US 8,083,741 B2, issued
Dec. 27, 2011); 1

(ii)

claims 6, 13, and 14 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Morgan '741 in view of Morgan '597 (US
2008/0300597 Al, published Dec. 4, 2008); and

(iii)

claim 8 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being unpatentable over
Morgan '741 in view of Avni (US 6,273,863 Bl, issued Aug.
14, 2001).

ANALYSIS

Claims 1-5, 7, 9-12, and 15-20--Anticipation by Morgan '741
The issue joined by Appellants and the Examiner is whether Morgan
'7 41 discloses "a second sensor isolated between two bone fixation element
receiving holes of the implant measuring strain in a non-weakened portion of
the bone," as set forth in claim 1. See Appeal Br. 3---6; Ans. 10-14.
Appellants maintain that, in Morgan '7 41, "no sensor [] is located in [a]
portion of a bone plate which is installed over a non-weakened portion of the
bone and is clearly not located between tow bone fixation element receiving
holes to be installed over such a non-weakened portion." Appeal Br. 4.
Appellants also maintain that Morgan does not disclose a second sensor that
is isolated between two bone fixation element receiving holes. Id. at 4--5.
The Examiner initially relies upon a general statement in Morgan '741
to the effect that sensors may be located at various locations on the implant
plate, or may surround or be located within holes in the plate as a teaching of
the claimed second sensor being isolated between two bone fixation element
receiving holes. Final Act. 13; see also Ans. 10-11. Such broad statements
are ineffective in establishing anticipation, in that anticipation requires that
every element of the claimed invention be literally present, arranged as in
the claim. Perkin-Elmer Corp. v. Computervision Corp., 732 F.2d 888, 894
(Fed .Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 857 (1984); Kalman v. Kimberly-Clark

Corp., 713 F.2d 760, 771-72 (Fed. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1026
(1984). Further, the identical invention must be shown in as complete detail
as is contained in the patent claim. Jamesbury Corp. v. Litton Industrial

Products, Inc., 756 F.2d 1556, 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1985); Connell v. Sears,
Roebuck & Co., 722 F.2d 1542, 1548 (Fed. Cir. 1983).

Appeal2014-003808
Application 12/909,220

The Examiner also provides an annotated version of Figure 2 of
Morgan '741, illustrating what is regarded as being a non-weakened portion
of a bone, as well as the placement of a sensor or sensors on an implant plate
that are "located/isolated to measure strain in a non-weakened portion of the
bone." Final Act. 13. Appellants reply that their understanding of the
Examiner's positon relative to Figure 2 is that sensors 50 shown near a top
edge of bone plate 10 correspond to the claimed second sensor. Appeal Br.
5. That is our understanding as well. Appellants, however, point out that
those sensors 50 on the top portion of the plate are each associated with a
plate hole which receives a bone fixation element, and thus are not isolated
from the holes as claimed. Id.
The Examiner does not directly address this alleged deficiency,
instead pointing out that a broadest reasonable interpretation of "isolated"
may be broader than Appellants' proffered meaning. Ans. 12. Further, the
Examiner shifts focus to Figure 3 of Morgan, provides an annotated version
thereof, and finds that various sensors surrounding a bone fixation element
receiving hole are between, and isolated or set apart from, other bone
fixation element receiving holes that do not have surrounding sensors. Id. at
13. The Examiner's position is unavailing.
Appellants and the Examiner appear to agree that the term isolated is
generally accepted to mean "set or placed apart, detached or separated so as
to be alone." Appeal Br. 6; Ans. 12. In the context of the present invention,
Appellants take the position that the recitation of the second sensor being
"isolated" requires the sensor "to be disposed on the implant sufficiently
separated from the two bone fixation holes by itself with no relation to other

4

Appeal2014-003808
Application 12/909,220
holes of the implant." Appeal Br. 4-5. Although the Examiner is correct
that such language is not provided in any definitional sense in the
Specification, the Specification does make clear that the notion of the sensor
being isolated is so that the strain measured by the sensor is affected only by
the load placed on the bone. Claim 1 similarly requires that the second
sensor measure strain in a non-weakened portion of a bone, and not strain
affected by loads in addition to those placed on the bone.
In contrast, Morgan '741 discusses the sensors in Figure 3 as being
used to measure compression of the implant plate to the underlying bone, in
order to determine whether remedial action in the form of replacement of the
plate or the fastening screws may be required. Morgan '741, col. 5, 11.
11-15, 11. 37--46. It appears from Morgan '741 that this compression is
advantageously measured around the periphery of the holes through which
the fastening screws are installed, and thus the sensors are not isolated from
the loads imposed by those screws on the plate such that the sensor can
measure strain on a non-weakened portion of a bone.
As such, we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1 based
on anticipation by Morgan '7 41. Independent claims 11 and 15 include
similar limitations to those discussed with respect to claim 1, and the
rejection is not sustained as to those claims. The same is true of claims
2-10, 12-14, and 16-20, which depend from one of claims 1, 11, and 15.

Claims 6, 13, and 14--Unpatentable over Morgan '741 and Morgan '597

The Examiner relies on the same erroneous findings as to Morgan
'7 41 as in the anticipation rejection of claim 1 discussed above, and does not
rely on Morgan '597 to cure the deficiencies noted. For the same reasons as

5

Appeal2014-003808
Application 12/909,220
presented above, the rejection of claims 6, 13, and 14 as being unpatentable
over Morgan '741 and Morgan '597 is not sustained.

Claim 8--Unpatentable over Morgan '741 and Avni

The Examiner relies on the same erroneous findings as to Morgan
'7 41 as in the anticipation rejection of claim 1 discussed above, and does not
rely on Avni to cure the deficiencies noted. For the same reasons as
presented above, the rejection of claim 8 as being unpatentable over Morgan
'7 41 and Avni is not sustained.

DECISION
The rejection of claims 1-5, 7, 9-12, and 15-20 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 102(b) as being anticipated by Morgan '741 is reversed.
The rejection of claims 6, 13, and 14 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
being unpatentable over ~v1organ '741 in view of ~v1organ '597 is reversed.
The rejection of claim 8 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Morgan '741 in view of Avni is reversed.
