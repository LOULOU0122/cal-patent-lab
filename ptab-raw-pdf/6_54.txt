DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Kathleen R. Phillips et al. (Appellants) seek our review under 35
U.S.C. § 134 of the Examiner's Final decision rejecting claims 1-27. We
have jurisdiction over the appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

THE CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claimed invention is directed to a thermal management system for
oil. Spec. i-f 2. Claim 1 is illustrative of the claims on appeal and is
reproduced below. 1
1.
A lubricant supply system for a gas turbine engine
compnsmg:
a lubricant pump delivering lubricant to an outlet line,
said outlet line splitting into at least a hot line and into a cool
line, said hot line being directed primarily to locations
associated with an engine that are not intended to receive cooler
lubricant, and said cool line being directed through one or more
heat exchangers at which lubricant is cooled, and said cool line
then being routed to a fan drive gear; and

Appellants filed an Amendment on March 19, 2014, the same day as filing
the Appeal Brief, but there is no indication in the record that the Amendment
(hereinafter "Amendment filed concurrently with the Appeal Brief') was
entered. See Ans. 1--4; see also MPEP § 1205.02 (stating "37 CPR
41.37(c)(2) prohibits the inclusion in a brief of any nev,r or non-admitted
amendment, affidavit or other evidence. If an appellant wishes to seek
review of an examiner's refusal to admit an amendment, affidavit or
evidence, such review is by petition to the Director under 37 CPR 1.181. "),
§ 1206(!) (stating "Entry of a new amendment in an application on appeal is
not a matter of right. The entry of an amendment (which may not include a
new affidavit, declaration, exhibit or other evidence) submitted in an
application on appeal is governed by 37 CPR 41.33, not 37 CPR 1.116.").
Further, although Appellants refer to the Amendment filed concurrently with
the Appeal Brief and argue that the Amendment negates the rejection of
certain claims (Appeal Br. 4), the Examiner's Answer states that Appellant
presented no arguments for these rejections (Ans. 2). Based on the lack of
any indication in the record that the Amendment filed concurrently with the
Appeal Brief was entered, and the Examiner's comments in the Answer, we
understand the Examiner to not have entered the Amendment filed
concurrently with the Appeal Brief, and we further understand the pending
claims to be those filed with the last entered Amendment (filed on
September 13, 2013).

point where said outlet line splits into said at least said hot line
and said cool line, such that said hot line is not directed through
said fuel/oil cooler.

ANALYSIS
Rejection(!)

Appellants do not make substantive arguments against this rejection.
See Appeal Br. 4--8. Accordingly, we summarily sustain the Examiner's

rejection of claims 1-27 on the ground of obviousness-type double patenting
over claims 1-3, 8-12, 15, 17, and 18 of Steams, claims 1-18 of Phillips,
and claims 1-16 of Papa.
Rejection (II)

Since the date of the Final Office Action, patent application serial no.
13/926,154 was abandoned, and we therefore decline to reach this
provisional double patenting rejection.
Re} ection (111)

The Examiner finds that Schwarz teaches all the features recited in
claim 1, and specifically, "Schwarz teaches a cool line consisting of 23-25-

4

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
27-28-29 and the hot line consisting of23-25-28-32." Final Act. 4-5, and
12.
Appellants assert that claim 1 "requires 'at least one of said one or
more heat exchangers is a fuel/oil cooler, and said fuel/oil cooler being
downstream of a point where said outlet line splits into said at least said hot
line and said cool line'" and that "[t]he line downstream of the combiner 28
heading to the heat exchanger 29 in Schwarz cannot meet the 'fuel/oil
cooler' limitation, nor can it meet the limitation that 'said hot line is not
directed through said fuel/oil cooler."' Appeal Br. 5.
In response, the Examiner refers to an annotated copy of Figure 4 of
Schwarz. See Ans. 2--4; see also Final Act. 5. We reproduce the
Examiner's annotated version of Figure 4 of Schwarz below.

Figure 4 of Schwarz depicts schematic diagram of a generator lubrication
system coupled to an engine lubrication system via oil-to-oil heat exchanger
40, which is positioned upstream of air-oil heat exchanger 29. Schwarz

iii! 34--35. The Examiner's annotations indicate where the Examiner finds
the hot, cool, first, and second lines. Ans. 3.
Further describing annotated Figure 4, the Examiner states:
[E]ven though Schwarz teaches a combined flow at 28 (when
lubricant flows through heat exchanger 27), the flow reaching
parts 32 would always be hotter than the flow reaching parts 36
(the flow to 36 passes through additional heat exchangers 40 and
29) as such the line from 25-28-32 reads on claim limitation "hot
line" and the line 25-27-28-40-29-36 reads on claim limitation
"cool line" (the flow in line 25-28 is hotter than the flow in line
25-27-28 and the flow in line 28-32 is hotter than the flow in line
28-40-29-36).
Ans. 2-3 (emphasis added).
In reply, Appellants reiterate, "the claimed cool line must pass
through a fuel/oil cooler downstream of a point where the outlet line splits
into the hot line and the cool line. In Schwarz, the fuel/oil cooler 27 is
upstream of the point 28." Reply Br. 2.
We agree with Appellants on this issue. In the discussion of the
rejection of claim 1, the Examiner does not specifically identify the point in
Schwarz' Figure 4 where the Examiner finds that the outlet line splits "into
at least a hot line ... and into a cool line" as recited in claim 1. See Final
Act. 4--5, 12. However, in the discussion of claim 12, the Examiner finds
that combiner arrangement 28 corresponds to such a point. Final Act. 6.
Further, as combiner arrangement 28 is the last common point in what the
Examiner finds, in the rejection of claim 1, are the cool line (25-27-28-4029-36) and hot line (25-28-32), it appears that the Examiner considers
combiner arrangement 28 to be the point at which the two lines split in the
rejection of claim 1, as well. The Examiner's annotations to Figure 4 also
indicate that the Examiner considers combiner arrangement 28 to be the
6

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
point where the outlet line splits. As Appellants point out (Appeal Br. 5; see
also Reply Br. 2) the heat exchanger downstream from combiner

arrangement 28 is not a fuel-oil cooler as required by claim 1. Rather, the
fuel-oil cooler disclosed in Schwarz (oil and fuel heat exchanger 27) is
upstream of combiner arrangement 28. See Schwarz, Fig. 4. Accordingly,

we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1 and claims 2--4
depending therefrom as anticipated by Schwarz.
Claim 12

Independent claim 12 recites, in part:
a valve positioned on said cool line, at a location
downstream of a point where said hot line splits off from said
cool line, and said valve splitting said cool line into two lines,
with a first line being directed through said one or more heat
exchanger, and a second line being directed through at least one
other cooler.
Amendment (filed Sept. 13, 2013) 5. Referring to the annotated copy of
Figure 4 of Schwarz, the Examiner finds that Schwarz teaches "a valve (41)
positioned on said cool line, at a location downstream of a point where said
hot line splits off Uunction 28) from said cool line, and said valve splitting
said cool line into two lines." Final Act. 6.
Appellants' state:
[T]he Examiner also argues that the valve 41 of Schwarz would
separate the cool line into two lines. However, this interpretation
misses the point that Schwarz lacks a cool line and a hot line, as
required by independent claim 12. Rather, given the Examiner's
apparent interpretation, all of the flow is either hot or cold, i.e.,
there is no cool line directed to the fan drive gear.
Appeal Br. 7. Appellants further state that claim 12 requires:
[A] valve positioned on the cool line at a location downstream of
the point where the hot line splits off from the cool line, and the
7

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
valve splitting the cool line into two lines, with the first line being
directed through "said one or more heat exchanger[,]" and a
second lines being directed through at least one other cooler. The
flow to the "cool line" 23 of Schwarz does not meet this
limitation, as it does not have the split, as was previously pointed
out.
Reply Br. 2 (emphasis added).
We agree with Appellants on this issue because valve 41 in Schwarz
is a bypass valve and therefore does not split the flow it receives via line 23
into two lines, as claimed. See Schwarz ,-r 30. In this regard, Schwarz states:
This bypass valve allows computer 26' to direct the engine oil
from air and oil heat exchanger 29 directly to higher temperature
sensitivity parts 36 thus bypassing heat exchanger 40 to thereby
prevent heat in the engine oil and heat in the generator oil from
being transferred from one to the other.
Schwarz ,-r 30. Thus, as Appellants point out, the flow leaving valve 41 is all
the same temperature inasmuch as there is only one flow stream leaving
valve 41. Schwarz either (i) directs this flow to the heat exchanger 40 to
exchange heat between the generator oil (in line 13) and engine oil (in line
23), or (ii) directs the flow to bypass heat exchanger 40. Thus, bypass valve
41 does not split the flow in line 23 as required by claim 12. Accordingly,
we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 12, or of claims 13, 16,
and 17 depending therefrom, as anticipated by Schwarz.
Rejection (IV)

Appellants assert that the rejection of claims 1 and 24 as anticipated
by Coffinberry is "moot" in light of the Amendment filed concurrently with
the Appeal Brief. See Appeal Br. 4. As this Amendment was not entered by
the Examiner, this argument is not commensurate with the current status of

8

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
claims 1 and 24, and we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 1 and 24
as anticipated by Coffinberry.
Rejection (V)
Appellants assert that "claim 1 is being amended in the concurrently
filed Amendment to recite the limitations of claim 2, thereby reducing issues
for Appeal," and this renders the rejection of claim 1 as unpatentable over
Schwarz moot. Appeal Br. 4. However, as discussed above, the record does
not indicate that the Amendment filed concurrently with the Appeal Brief
was entered by the Examiner, and the Examiner's comments indicate that
the Examiner has not considered the above-noted Amendment to the claims.
Specifically, the Examiner sates:
[NJ o arguments for [the] rejection of Claim 1 under 35 USC [§]
103(a) as being obvious over Schwarz as discussed on page 7
paragraph 12 of the Office Action mailed on 10/21/2013.
Consequently no arguments were presented for rejection of
Claims 6, 18, 19, 22 and 23 as being unpatentable over Schwarz
in view of Gilson because Appellant just argued on page 7 that
independent claims 6 and 18 recite same features as claim 1.
Ans. 2. 3
In reply, Appellants reiterate that claim 1 was amended to include the
features of claim 2, and Schwarz "was not relied upon, standing alone, to
3

We do not have jurisdiction to review the Examiner's decision to enter or
not enter the Amendment filed concurrently with the Appeal Brief, as this is
a matter that is reviewable by petition to the Director under 3 7 C.F .R.
§ 1.181. See MPEP §1201 (the Board will not ordinarily hear a question that
is reviewable by petition); In re Berger, 279 F.3d 975, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2002)
(citing In re Hengehold, 440 F .2d 1395, 1403 (CCP A 1971 )) (stating that
there are many kinds of decisions made by examiners that are not appealable
to the Board when they are not directly connected with the merits of issues
involving rejections of claims); and In re Mindick, 371 F.2d 892, 894
(CCPA 1967) (holding that the refusal of an examiner to enter an
9

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
reject claim 2. As stated at Page 4 of the Appeal Brie±: that rejection is now
moot." Reply Br. 1.
As the Amendment filed concurrently with the Appeal Brief was not
entered by the Examiner, the claims on appeal are those filed with the last
entered Amendment (filed on September 13, 2013), and Appellants'
arguments are not commensurate with the scope of claims 1 and 5.
Accordingly, we find Appellants argument to be unpersuasive, and we
sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1 and claim 5 depending therefrom
as unpatentable over Schwarz.
Rejection (VI)

Independent claim 6 recites, in part, "said fuel/oil cooler being
downstream of a point where said outlet line splits into said at least said hot
line and said cool line." Amendment 4 (filed Sept. 13, 2013). Independent
claim 18 recites, in part, "a valve positioned on said cool line, at a location
downstream of a point where said hot line splits off from said cool line." Id
at 6.
The Examiner finds that "Schwarz teaches all the inventions as
discussed above for Claim 1 (under 35 USC [§]102 above and as an
alternative under 35 USC [§]103 above) and Claim 12 including a gas

turbine engine." Final Act. 9 (emphasis added). The Examiner further finds
that "Schwarz does not teach the specifics of the gas turbine engine"
required by claims 6 and 18, and the Examiner relies on Gilson to teach
these features. Final Act. 9.

amendment of claims is reviewable by petition under 37 C.F .R. § 1.181, and
not by appeal to the Board)).
10

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
Appellants rely on the same arguments for the patentability of
independent claims 6 and 18 as those discussed above regarding the
patentability of claims 1 and 12. Appeal Br. 7.

Claims 6--11
We agree with Appellants' arguments with respect to the rejection of
claim 1 as anticipated by Schwarz, and we reverse the Examiner's rejection
of claim 6 and claims 7-11 depending therefrom based on the Examiner's
incorrect finding that Schwarz discloses all the features recited in claim 1.
With respect to the rejection of claim 6 based on the Examiner's
finding that claim 1 is unpatentable over Schwarz under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a),
we sustain this rejection for the same reasons discussed above for Rejection
(V). Claims 7-11 fall with claim 6.

Claims 18, 19, 22, and 23
For the same reasons discussed above regarding the rejection of claim
12 as anticipated by Schwarz, we reverse the Examiner's rejection of claims
18, 19, 22, and 23 as unpatentable over Schwarz and Gilson.

Re} ection (VII)
Appellants rely on the Amendment filed concurrently with the Appeal
Brief to address the rejection of claims 6 and 26 as unpatentable over Gilson
and Coffinberry. Appeal Br. 2. However, as discussed above, this
Amendment was not entered by the Examiner. Accordingly, we sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claims 6 and 26 as unpatentable over Gilson and
Coffinberry.

Rejection (VIII)
The Examiner states, "[c]laim 25 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as
being unpatentable over Schwarz in view of Sheridan (6,223, 616). Schwarz
11

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
teaches the invention as claimed and as discussed for Claims 1 and 5,
above." Final Act. 11. We understand the Examiner's reference to a
discussion of claims 1 and 5 to refer to the Examiner's rejection of claims 1
and 5 as unpatentable over Schwarz (see Final Act. 7-8) because the
anticipation rejection based on Schwarz does not include a rejection of claim
5 (see Final Act. 4---6).
Appellants assert that the rejection of claim 25 is "moot" in light of
the cancelation of claim 25 in the Amendment filed concurrently with the
Appeal Brief. 8. As this Amendment was not entered by the Examiner,
Appellants' argument is not commensurate with the current status of claim
25, and we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 25.
Rejection (IX)

Appellants assert that the rejection of claim 27 is "moot" in light of
the cancelation of claim 27 in the Amendment filed concurrently with the
Appeal Brief. 8. As this Amendment was not entered by the Examiner, the
argument is not commensurate with the current status of claim 27. Claim 27
ultimately depends from claim 6. Accordingly, claim 27 falls with claim 6
for the same reasons discussed above regarding Rejection (VI).

DECISION
(I) We affirm the Examiner's rejection of claims 1-27 on the ground

of obviousness-type double patenting over claims 1-3, 8-12, 15, 17, and 18
of Steams, claims 1-18 of Phillips, and claims 1-16 of Papa.
(II) We do not reach the Examiner's provisional rejection of claims
1-27 on the ground of obviousness-type double patenting over claims 1-15
of patent application serial no. 13/926,154.
12

Appeal2014-007809
Application 13/794,976
(Ill) We reverse the Examiner's rejection of claims 1--4, 12, 13, 16,
and 17 as anticipated by Schwarz.
(IV) We affirm the Examiner's rejection of claims 1 and 24 as
anticipated by Coffinberry.
(V) We affirm the Examiner's rejection of claims 1 and 5 as
unpatentable over Schwarz.
(VI) We affirm the Examiner's rejection of Claims 6-11 as
unpatentable over Schwarz and Gilson based on applying Schwarz in
accordance with Rejection (V).
We reverse the Examiner's rejection of Claims 6-11 as unpatentable
over Schwarz and Gilson based on applying Schwarz in accordance with
Rejection (III).
We reverse the Examiner's rejection of claims 18, 19, 22, and 23 as
unpatentable over Schwarz and Gilson.
(VII) We affirm the Examiner's rejection of claims 6 and 26 as
unpatentable over Gilson and Coffinberry.
(VIII) We affirm the Examiner's rejection of claim 25 as
unpatentable over Schwarz and Sheridan.
(IX) We affirm the Examiner's rejection of claim 27 as unpatentable
over Schwarz, Gilson, and Sheridan.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.
§ 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
