BACKGROUND
The disclosed subject matter "relates to protecting airfoil components
from foreign object damage and, more particularly, an indicator that alerts an
operator to wear." Spec. i-f 1. Claims 1, 5, 12, and 17 are independent.
Claim 1 is reproduced below:
1. An airfoil assembly comprising:

an airfoil body extending between a leading
edge, a trailing edge, a suction side, and a pressure
side;
a first protective sheath having an outer side
and an inner side that forms a cavity for receiving at
least a portion of the airfoil body, the inner side
being bonded to the leading edge of the airfoil body;
an indicator sheath bonded to the first
protective sheath, at least a portion of the indicator
sheath positioned forward the first protective sheath
relative to the leading edge of the airfoil body; and
a second protective sheath, at least a portion
of the second protective sheath positioned forward
the indicator sheath relative to the leading edge of
the airfoil body, wherein the indicator sheath is
fixed and immoveable relative to both the first and
second protective sheaths.

DISCUSSION
Rejection 1 - The rejection of claims 12, 13,
and 16 as Anticipated by Kageorge

For this Rejection, Appellants argue independent claim 12 and do not
separately argue claims 13 and 16, which depend from claim 12. Appeal Br.
4--5. Thus, we address claim 12, with claims 13 and 16 standing or falling
with claim 12. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37 (c)(l)(iv) (2014). Claim 12 recites an
"indicator sheath having ... an inner side, ... the inner side forming a
cavity for receiving at least a leading edge portion of a first protective sheath
and for directly bonding the inner side to the leading edge portion." Appeal
Br. 18 (Claims App.). The Examiner identified element 20 in Kageorge as
the "indicator sheath" and element 18 as the "first protective sheath." Final
Act. 4--5. The Examiner also cites column 5, lines 42--46 regarding "directly
bonding the inner side to the leading edge portion" (the "'directly bonding'
limitation"). See id. at 5.
First, Appellants contend that "deformable sheet 20 includes no inner
side forming a cavity for directly bonding to a leading edge portion of the
base ply 18" and that "deformable sheet 20 moves relative to the base ply at
a leading edge portion of the base ply 18" in order to "avoid[] ice formation
at the leading edge portion." Appeal Br. 4 (stating also that "Figures 3 and 4
from Kageorge show the positions of the deformable sheet 20 when moved
3

The Examiner also rejected claim 4 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Haines and Lofstrom. See Final Act. 31. In the Answer,
the Examiner withdraws this Rejection as to claim 4. See Ans. 32.

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
relative to the base ply 18 at the leading edge portion"). Referencing a
portion of the passage cited by the Examiner, Appellants state that "[t]his
cementing, however, is not at a leading edge portion" but rather "is at a
periphery of the sheet 20." Id. at 5. Appellants argue that "sheet 20 wraps
over and covers the entire leading edge" and that "[t]he periphery of the
sheet 20 is thus not at a leading edge portion as is claimed." Id. According
to Appellants, "[i]f the cementing were at the leading edge portion, the sheet
20 would not be able to move relative to the base play 18 at the leading edge
portion to prevent ice formation." Id.
We are not apprised of error based on this argument. As noted by the
Examiner, Kageorge teaches that "sheet 20 has inextensible threads 44
incorporated therein" (see col. 5, 11. 23-24) and that "sheet 20 wraps around
the leading edge (as shown in Figure 6) and is cemented to the base ply 18
(see col.5:11.42--46) in such a manner as to form inflatable passages 54 (see
Figure 4) for de-icing." Ans. 24. Kageorge, in the relied-upon passage and
the passage prior, also provides:
Spaced warp threads 46 of preferably the same inextensible
material [as threads 44] are also incorporated into the fabric to
act as anchoring points around which the ends of the inextensible
fill threads may be secured. Retention of the inextensible threads
is enhanced by the cementing of the periphery on the inner face
of the deformable sheet 20 to the base ply 18 so that the two
inextensible warp threads are cemented therebetween.
Kageorge, col. 5, 11. 39--46. The "cementing" disclosed is thus located
between elements 18 and 20 but only at the "periphery" of element 20
(specifically, along the length of the two inextensible warp threads 46) rather
than over the entire inner face of element 20. See Kageorge, Fig. 2 (showing
one of the two warp threads 46).

5

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
That "deformable sheet 20 moves relative to the base ply at a leading
edge portion of the base ply 18" (Appeal Br. 4) does not show that Kageorge
fails to satisfy the "directly bonding" limitation. Although certain
embodiments in the Specification show the entire "inner side" of the
"indicator sheath" bonded to the "leading edge portion" of the "first
protective sheath" (see, e.g., Fig. 2A) thereby preventing relative motion of
those structures, Appellants have not shown that the limitation at issue
requires such a configuration. See In re Van Geuns, 988 F.2d 1181, 1184
(Fed. Cir. 1993) ("[L]imitations are not to be read into the claims from the
specification."). Further, Figures 3 and 4 in Kageorge do not illustrate crosssections at the location of the relied-upon "cementing." See Kageorge, Fig.
2 (showing line 3-3 at a position other than that of threads 46); see also id.,
col. 4, 1. 4 ("FIG. 4 is a sectional view taken along line 3-3."). Thus, the
"gap between the sheet and the base ply" depicted in Figure 4 (Reply Br. 2)
does not indicate that Kageorge fails to satisfy the "directly bonding"
limitation.
We are also not apprised of error by the contention that the reliedupon cementing "is not at a leading edge portion" but rather "is at a
periphery of the sheet 20." Appeal Br. 5. Although Kageorge does disclose
that the cementing is located at the "periphery on the inner face of the
deformable sheet 20" (Kageorge, col. 5, 11. 42--46 (emphasis added)), even
the "periphery" of element 20 is within the "leading edge portion." Indeed,
Kageorge describes Figure 2 using that term, stating that Figure 2 "shows
the leading edge portion of the wing with its pneumatic deicer operatively
secured thereto." Kageorge, col. 4, 11. 28-29.

6

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
Second, Appellants contend that Kageorge's "deformable sheet 20
also includes no inner side forming a cavity for directly bonding to a leading
edge portion of the base ply 18." Appeal Br. 5. The Examiner responds that
"[s]ince the sheet 20 wraps around the leading edge (as shown in Figure 6)
and is cemented to the base ply 18 (see col.5:11.42--46), then the claimed
limitation is deemed to be anticipated." Ans. 24--25. Here, we view the
Examiner as implicitly finding that, based on the structural relationship
between elements 20 and 18 and the leading edge depicted, for example, in
Figure 6, that Kageorge discloses that the "inner side" of element 20 forms a
"cavity." Appellants have not apprised us of error in that finding. To the
extent that Appellants contend that the limitation at issue requires the entire
"inner side" of the "indicator sheath" to be bonded to the "leading edge
portion" of the "first protective sheath," we disagree for the reasons
discussed above.
For these reasons, we sustain the rejection of independent claim 12 as
anticipated by Kageorge. Claims 13 and 16 fall with claim 12. Because
certain findings of fact differ from those of the Examiner, we designate our
affirmance of this Rejection as a new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R.
§ 41. 50(b) to provide Appellants with a full and fair opportunity to respond

to the Rejection, as modified.
Rejection 2 - The rejection of claims 12, 15,
and 16 as Anticipated by Haines

For this Rejection, Appellants argue independent claim 12 and do not
separately argue claims 15 and 16, which depend from claim 12. Appeal Br.
5-7. Thus, we address claim 12, with claims 15 and 16 standing or falling
with claim 12. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37 (c)(l)(iv). The Examiner identified

7

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
element 35 in Haines as the "indicator sheath" and elements 15/16 (which
include elements 20/21/22/23) as the "first protective sheath." Final Act. 4-5; see also Appeal Br. 5 (stating that the Examiner identified "forward
margins 22 and 23 as ... the first protective sheath").
First, Appellants contend that "filling material 35 is not an indicator
sheath" and that Haines teaches that "nosepiece 30 of the blade in Haines is
removed and replaced well before wearing to the point of exposing filler
material 35." Appeal Br. 5, 6 (discussing Haines, col. 3, 11. 9-13).
Appellants argue that "[i]t is directly contrary to these teachings that the
propeller of Haines would wear through the nosepiece, and then through the
heater element 40, to expose the cellular rubber core as an indicator." Id. at
6; see also id. at 5 (stating that "filling material 35 is a cellular rubber or
plastic").
Features of an apparatus claim may be recited either structurally or
functionally. In re Schreiber, 128 F.3d 1473, 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1997). If the
Patent Office has reason to believe that a functional limitation recited in an
apparatus claim "may, in fact, be an inherent characteristic of the prior art, it
possesses the authority to require the applicant to prove that the subject
matter shown to be in the prior art does not possess the characteristic relied
on." Id. (quoting In re Swinehart, 439 F.2d 210, 213 (CCPA 1971)).
Here, Appellants have not shown that the term "sheath" structurally
distinguishes over element 35 in Haines. Although Appellants contend that
the term"' [i]ndicator' structurally distinguishes the claimed sheath from
sheaths that are not indicators" (Reply Br. 2), Appellants do not explain
what structural limitations the term "indicator" provides as to the "sheath."
See also Reply Br. 2 ("Indicator structurally modifies sheath into a sheath

8

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
that is an indicator."). We view "indicator" as modifying "sheath" such that
the "sheath" is configured to perform the function of indicating wear to other
structure(s). This is supported by the Specification, which provides that
"indicator sheath 72, when exposed, is a visual cue that the nose 62 of the
airfoil assembly 20 has worn through the distance 84 of the sheath 60."
Spec. i-f 28 (discussing Fig. 2a).
Based on the configuration disclosed in Haines, we find that element
35 would inherently be capable of performing the recited function.
Specifically, we find that element 35 would, based on its configuration with
respect to elements 30 and 40, be capable of indicating wear through
elements 30 and 40 that exposed element 35. See, e.g., Haines, Fig. 3. That
Haines does not explicitly disclose using element 35 to perform this function
does not undermine the rejection, as such a characteristic can be inherent.
See Schreiber, 128 F.3d at 1478. Further, that Haines discloses that "if the

nose-piece 30 be damaged it may be quite readily removed from the main
blade structure" (col. 3, 11. 9-11) such that element 35 may not, in some
instances, actually be exposed does not undermine that, in the disclosed
configuration, element 35 is capable of indicating wear.
Second, Appellants contend that "sheaths 15 and 16 are not protective
sheaths," but rather, "are the main upper airfoil sheath 15 and the main lower
airfoil sheath 16" that "provide the airfoil." Appeal Br. 6. According to
Appellants, "[i]t is not a reasonable interpretation of the claim to consider
the sheaths that define the airfoil body as being protective sheaths separate
from an airfoil body" because "rubber filler 55, 56, 57 would not provide an
airfoil body without the sheaths 15 and 16" as "[t]he rubber filler is held
together by the sheaths 15 and 16." Id.

9

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
We are not apprised of error here. The term "protective" modifies
"sheath" such that the "sheath" is configured to perform the function of
protecting other structure(s). The Examiner states that "sheaths 15 and 16
perform the function of being 'protective' of filler material 55 due to their
relative locations." Ans. 25; see also Haines, Fig. 3. Appellants have not
shown error in that finding. See Schreiber, 128 F.3d at 1478.
We tum now to the assertions that "rubber filler 55, 56, 57 would not
provide an airfoil body without the sheaths 15 and 16" and that "Haines
teaches no airfoil body without the sheaths 15 and 16." Appeal Br. 6.
Contrary to Appellants' assertion, claim 12 does not recite "an 'airfoil body
extending between a leading edge, a trailing edge, a suction side, and a
pressure side."' Appeal Br. 6. And we will not import into claim 12 the
requirement that the "first protective sheath" must "protect[]" an "airfoil
body." See Van Geuns, 988 F.2d at 1184.
For these reasons, we sustain the rejection of independent claim 12 as
anticipated by Haines. Claims 15 and 16 fall with claim 12. Because certain
findings of fact differ from those of the Examiner, we designate our
affirmance of this Rejection as a new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R.
§ 41. 50(b) to provide Appellants with a full and fair opportunity to respond

to the Rejection, as modified.

Rejection 3-The rejection ofclaims 1, 12, 13, 17, 19,
24, and 26 as Unpatentable over Haines and Cross
A. Claims 1, 12, 13, 17, 24, and 26
Appellants argue the patentability of the three independent claims in
this Rejection---claims 1, 12, and 17-based on the same arguments and do
not provide separate arguments for any dependent claims. Appeal Br. 7-9.
We select independent claim 1 as representative, with the remaining claims
standing or falling with claim 1. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37 (c)(l)(iv). For each
of the independent claims, the Examiner identified, in Haines, ( 1) element
40 as the "indicator sheath," (2) element 35 as the "first protective sheath,"
and (3) element 30 as the "second protective sheath." Final Act. 7-8, 9, 11.
First, Appellants argue that "heater element 40 fails to teach the
claimed indicator sheath" and, instead, "is a flexible sheet of wires." Appeal
Br. 7. According to Appellants, Haines teaches that "if the nose-piece 30 is
damaged, the nose-piece 30 is removed and replaced by another nose-piece
30." Id. (citing Haines, col. 3, 11. 9-13). Appellants contend that because
"nose-piece 30 is removed and replaced when damaged, the heater element
40 ... is never exposed" and "thus never an indicator." Id. Appellants
argue that "the Examiner's interpretation of the claimed indicator sheath
essentially assigns no patentable weight to 'indicator' or 'sheath."' Id.
Here, Appellants have not shown that the term "sheath" distinguishes
over element 40 in Haines. As noted by the Examiner, the Specification
"indicates that a sheath can take the form of a wire (see paragraph [0037])."
Ans. 27; see Spec. i-f 37 (discussing Figure 5 and stating, "[i]n this example,
a copper wire 92 is used as the indicator sheath 472").
As to "indicator," for the same reasons discussed above (see supra
Rejection 2 (first argument)), we view that term as modifying "sheath" such
11

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
that the "sheath" is configured to perform the function of indicating wear to
other structure(s). Based on the configuration disclosed in Haines, we find
that element 40 would be inherently capable of performing the recited
function. Specifically, we find that element 40 would, based on its
configuration with respect to element 30, be capable of indicating wear
through element 30 that exposed element 40. See, e.g., Haines, Fig. 3. That
Haines does not explicitly disclose using element 40 to perform this function
does not undermine the rejection, as such a characteristic can be inherent.
See Schreiber, 128 F.3d at 1478. Further, that Haines discloses that "if the
nose-piece 30 be damaged it may be quite readily removed from the main
blade structure" (col. 3, 11. 9-11) such that element 40 may not, in some
instances, actually be exposed does not undermine that, in the disclosed
configuration, element 40 is capable of indicating wear.
Second, Appellants argue that "filling material 35 fails to teach the
claimed first protective sheath" and that "filling material 35 is a cellular
rubber or plastic," "not a sheath." Appeal Br. 8. Appellants argue that "[i]t
is not reasonable to consider the rubber or plastic filler material to teach a
protective sheath" because the "filler material is never exposed and thus is
never in a position appropriate to provide protection." Id.
Although Appellants contend that element 35 is "not a sheath"
(Appeal Br. 8), Appellants do not explain how that term distinguishes over
element 35. Here, the Examiner finds that "filling material 3 5 is a unified
body of material that provides covering and therefore a sheath." Ans. 27.
Appellants have not apprised us of error in this finding. Further, as
discussed above (see supra Rejection 2 (second argument)), the term
"protective" modifies "sheath" such that the "sheath" is configured to

12

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
perform the function of protecting other structure(s). The Examiner states
that "the filling material performs the function of being 'protective' of
sheaths 15 and 16 due to their relative locations." Ans. 27; see also Haines,
Fig. 3. Appellants have not shown error in that finding. See Schreiber, 128
F.3d at 1478.
For these reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 1 as unpatentable
over Haines and Cross. Claims 12, 13, 17, 24, and 26 fall with claim 1.
Because the reasoning and certain findings of fact differ from those of the
Examiner, we designate our affirmance of this Rejection as to claims 1, 12,
13, 17, 24, and 26 as a new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b)
to provide Appellants with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the
Rejection, as modified.
B. Claim 19
Claim 19 depends from claim 17 and recites "wherein wearing the
second protective sheath exposes the indicator sheath." Appeal Br. 19
(Claims App.). Appellants argue that, in Haines, "wearing the nose-piece
does not expose the heater element 40" but rather "results in the nose-piece
30 being replaced (see column 3, lines 9-13)." Id. at 9.
We are not apprised of error based on this argument. As noted by the
Examiner, "[t]he wording of the instant claim has the effect of limiting the
structure of the invention rather than further defining procedural steps."
Ans. 27. We agree with the Examiner that "[ d]ue to their relative locations,
sufficient wear of the nose-piece 30 would result in heater element 40 being
exposed." Id. at 27-28. That Haines discloses that "if the nose-piece 30 be
damaged it may be quite readily removed from the main blade structure"
(col. 3, 11. 9-11) such that element 40 may not, in some instances, actually be

13

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
exposed does not undermine the fact that, in the disclosed configuration,
element 40 would be exposed by sufficient wear to nose-piece 30. See Ans.
28 (stating that "the intended process of replacement of nose-piece 30
disclosed by Haines does not negate the structural relationship between
nose-piece 30 and heater element 40").
Thus, we sustain the rejection as unpatentable over Haines and Cross.
Based on the dependence of claim 19 from claim 17 and the disposition
above (see supra Rejection 3, §A), we designate our affirmance of this
Rejection as to claim 19 as a new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.50(b).
Rejection 4-The rejection of claims 5, 7, 9, and 10
as Unpatentable over Haines, Cross, and Rutherford

For this Rejection, Appellants rely on the same arguments discussed
above regarding the rejection of claim 1 as unpatentable over Haines and
Cross (see supra Rejection 3, §A). See Appeal Br. 9. For the same reasons
discussed above, we sustain this Rejection. Because the reasoning and
certain findings of fact differ from those of the Examiner (based on the
arguments relied upon from Rejection 3), we designate our affirmance of
this Rejection as a new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) to
provide Appellants with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the
Rejection, as modified.
Rejection 5 - The rejection of claims 2, 3, 14, and 18
as Unpatentable over Haines, Cross, and Adams

Appellants do not separately argue claims 2, 3, 14, and 18 (Appeal Br.
10), which depend from claims addressed in Rejection 3, §A. For the same
reasons discussed above, we sustain this Rejection. Based on the
14

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
dependence of these claims from claims addressed above (see supra
Rejection 3, §A) and the disposition as to those parent claims (see id.), we
designate our affirmance of this Rejection as a new ground of rejection
under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b).

Rejection 6-The rejection of claims 5 and 7 as
Unpatentable over Haines, Cross, and Rutherford
For this Rejection, Appellants rely on the same arguments discussed
above regarding the rejection of claim 1 as unpatentable over Haines and
Cross (see supra Rejection 3, §A). See Appeal Br. 11. For the same
reasons discussed above, we sustain this Rejection. Because the reasoning
and certain findings of fact differ from those of the Examiner (based on the
arguments relied upon from Rejection 3), we designate our affirmance of
this Rejection as a new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) to
provide Appellants with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the
Rejection, as modified.

Rejection 7 - The rejection of claims 1 and 6
as Unpatentable over Haines and Lofstrom
For this Rejection, Appellants argue claim 1 and do not separately
argue claim 6, which depends from claim 1. Appeal Br. 11-12. Thus, we
address claim 1, with claim 6 standing or falling with claim 1. See 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.37 (c)(l)(iv). The Examiner identified, in Haines, (1) elements 55, 56,
57, and 10 as the "airfoil body," (2) element 35 as the "indicator sheath,"
and (3) elements 15 and 16 as the "first protective sheath." Final Act. 26.
First, Appellants contend that "filling material 3 5 fails to teach the
claimed indicator sheath" and that Haines teaches that "if the nose-piece 30
is damaged, the nose-piece 30 is removed and replaced by another nose15

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
piece 30." Appeal Br. 11 (discussing Haines, col. 3, 11. 9-13). According to
Appellants, because "nose-piece 30 is removed and replaced when damaged,
the filling material 35 is not an indicator sheath in any way" and "never
functions as an indicator." Id. Appellants argue that "the Examiner's
interpretation of the claimed indicator sheath essentially assigns no
patentable weight to 'indicator."' Id. at 12.
Here, Appellants have not shown that the term "sheath" structurally
distinguishes over element 35 in Haines. Although Appellants contend to
not be "attempting to broadly claim all types of sheaths, but rather a specific
type of sheath - an indicator sheath" (Reply Br. 3), Appellants do not
explain what structural limitations the term "indicator" provides as to the
"sheath" itself. Applying the same construction of "indicator" discussed
above (see supra Rejection 2 (first argument)), we find (for the same reasons
discussed above (see id.) that element 35 would be inherently capable of
performing the recited function.
Second, Appellants contend that "sheaths 15 and 16 are not protective
sheaths," but rather "are the main upper airfoil sheath 15 and the main lower
airfoil sheath 16" that "provide the airfoil." Appeal Br. 12. According to
Appellants, "[i]t is not reasonable to consider the sheaths that define the
airfoil body as being protective sheaths separate from an airfoil body"
because "rubber filler 55, 56, 57 would not provide an airfoil body without
the sheaths 15 and 16" as "[t]he rubber filler is held together by the sheaths
15 and 16." Id.
We are not apprised of error here. The term "protective" modifies
"sheath" such that the "sheath" is configured to perform the function of
protecting other structure(s). The Examiner states that "sheaths 15 and 16

16

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
perform the function of being 'protective' of filler material 55 due to their
relative locations." Ans. 29; see also Haines, Fig. 3. Appellants have not
shown error in that finding. See Schreiber, 128 F.3d at 1478.
We tum now to the assertion that "[i]t is not reasonable to consider
the sheaths that define the airfoil body as being protective sheaths separate
from an airfoil body." Appeal Br. 12. Although Haines does refer to
elements 15 and 16 as the "main upper air foil sheath" and "main lower air
foil sheath," respectively (col. 2, 11. 29-31 ), that does not indicate that those
structures "define"-and would necessarily be included in structures
identified as-the "airfoil body" recited in claim 1 (emphasis added).
Indeed, claim 1 recites the "airfoil body" as only one element of an "airfoil
assembly." Appeal Br. 16; see also Spec. i-f 16 ("In this case, the airfoil
assembly 20 includes an airfoil body 22 that extends between a leading edge
24, a trailing edge 26, a suction side 28, and a pressure side 30. In general,
the leading edge 24, the trailing edge 26, the suction side 28, and the
pressure side 30 are made with reference to an intended air flow 32 over the
airfoil assembly 20.").
We tum now to the assertions that "rubber filler 55, 56, 57 would not
provide an airfoil body without the sheaths 15 and 16" because "[t]he rubber
filler is held together by the sheaths 15 and 16" and that "Haines teaches no
airfoil body without the sheaths 15 and 16." Appeal Br. 12. Appellants
have not persuasively shown that "airfoil body" distinguishes over the
identified structures---collectively, elements 55, 56, 57, and 10. Even
assuming that elements 15 and 16 are necessary to hold elements 55, 56, 57,
and 10 together, Appellants have not shown this precludes elements 55, 56,
57, and 10 from satisfying the "airfoil body" limitation.

17

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
For these reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 1 as unpatentable
over Haines and Lofstrom. Claim 6 falls with claim 1. Because the
reasoning and certain findings of fact differ from those of the Examiner, we
designate our affirmance of this Rejection as a new ground of rejection
under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) to provide Appellants with a full and fair
opportunity to respond to the Rejection, as modified.

Rejection 8-The rejection of claims 5 and 8 as
Unpatentable over Haines, Lofstrom, and Rutherford
For this Rejection, the Examiner identified, in Haines, (1) elements
55, 56, 57, and 10 as the "airfoil body," (2) element 35 as the "indicator
sheath," and (3) elements 15 and 16 as the "first protective sheath." Final
Act. 28-29.
A. Independent Claim 5
For claim 5, the Examiner stated that Haines does not disclose "the
inner side of the first protective sheath (15, 16) being bonded to the leading
edge of the airfoil body (55)" but found that Lofstrom discloses "a rotor
blade having a sheath (i.e. - wear strip 32) (Figures 6 and 7) adhesively
bonded (50,52) (Figure 7) to an airfoil body (40) (Figure 7)." Id. at 29.
According to the Examiner, it would have been obvious "to modify the
airfoil assembly of Haines to include an adhesive bond between the first
protective sheath and the airfoil body, as disclosed by Lofstrom, for the
purpose of providing a secure attachment therebetween." Id. at 29-30.
First, Appellants argue that element 35 "is not an indicator sheath" for
"at least the reasons mentioned in response to the anticipation rejection of
claim 12 involving Haines." Appeal Br. 13. For the same reasons discussed

18

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
above, we are not apprised of error based on this argument. See supra
Rejection 2 (first argument).
Second, Appellants argue that elements 15 and 16 are not "the
claimed protective sheaths" for "the reasons mentioned in response to the
anticipation rejection of claim 12." Appeal Br. 13. For the same reasons
discussed above, we are not apprised of error based on this argument. See
supra Rejection 2 (second argument).

Third, Appellants argue that "there is no legally sufficient reason for
modifying Haines to include an adhesive bond between the sheaths 15 and
16, and the hard sponge rubber 55." Appeal Br. 13. According to
Appellants, because "sheaths 15 and 16 are assembled prior to the rubber 55
filling the space between the sheaths 15 and 16," there is "no need to
stabilize the sheaths 15 and 16 by bonding them to the rubber 55." Id.
As stated by the Examiner, "the proposed modification of adding an
adhesive to bond sheaths 15 and 16 to the rubber 55 is not to stabilize the
sheaths, per se, but, rather, to promote further stabilization of the attachment
between the sheaths 15 and 16 and the rubber 55 and, hence, the entire
airfoil assembly." Ans. 30. We determine that the statements relied on by
the Examiner to address claim 5 in this Rejection (Final Act. 29-30; Ans.
30) provide a "rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of
obviousness." In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006), cited with
approval in KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007).

Appellants have not shown error in that reasoning.

19

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
B. Claim 8
Claim 8 depends from claim 5. Appeal Br. 17 (Claims App.). As to
the additional limitation of claim 8, the Examiner stated that
stainless steel nose-piece 30 may be fixed rigidly in place where
its upper and lower margins 31 and 32 overlap suitably indented
portions of sheaths 15 and 16 by soldering or otherwise fixing
these overlapping portions together as by a rubber cement bond-)(see Haines col. 2, 11. 54--55 through col. 3, 11. 1--4) to bond the
second protective sheath (Haines, 30) to the first protective
sheath (Haines; 15, 16).
Final Act. 30-31.
Appellants contend that "there is no legally sufficient reason for
modifying Haines to space the sheaths 15 and 16 to 'establish an area that is
filled with an adhesive to bond the second protective sheath to the first
protective sheath."' Appeal Br. 13 (quoting claim 8). According to
Appellants, "sheaths 15 and 16 are welded together" and "[a] rubber cement
bond, as is suggested, would not benefit Haines in any way." Id.
We are not apprised of error based on this argument. As noted by the
Examiner, with respect to the limitation at issue, the Rejection "does not rely
on a modification but rather on a disclosure of the base reference [i.e.,
Haines] being inherited from the parent rejection." Ans. 30-31. Appellants
have not shown that column 2, line 54 through column 3, line 4 of Haines
fails to satisfy the limitation at issue.
For these reasons, we sustain the rejection of claims 5 and 8 as
unpatentable over Haines, Lofstrom, and Rutherford. Because the reasoning
and certain findings of fact differ from those of the Examiner (based on the
arguments relied upon from Rejection 2), we designate our affirmance of
this Rejection as a new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) to

20

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
provide Appellants with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the
Rejection, as modified.

Rejection 9 - The rejection of claim 1 as
Unpatentable over Haines and Lofstrom
For this Rejection, the Examiner identified, in Haines, (1) elements
55, 56, 57, and 10 as the "airfoil body," (2) element 35 as the "indicator
sheath," (3) elements 15 and 16 as the "first protective sheath," and (4)
element 40 as the "second protective sheath." Final Act. 31-32.
First, Appellants argue that element 35 "is not an indicator sheath" for
the reasons "mentioned in response to the first obviousness rejection
involving Haines and Lofstrom." Appeal Br. 14. For the same reasons
discussed above, we are not apprised of error based on this argument. See

supra Rejection 7 (first argument).
Second, Appellants argue that elements 15 and 16 are not "the
claimed protective sheaths" for "the reasons mentioned in response to the
anticipation rejection of claim 12." Appeal Br. 14. For the same reasons
discussed above, we are not apprised of error based on this argument. See

supra Rejection 2 (second argument).
Third, Appellants argue that "heater element 40 fails to teach a
protective sheath." Appeal Br. 14. Appellants contend that "heater element
40 is a flexible sheet that is not exposed (see column 3, line 27)" and that
"offers no protection whatsoever." Id. According to Appellants, "[i]t is not
reasonable to consider a flexible sheet sandwiched between two metallic
structures as a protective sheath." Id.
We are not apprised of error here. The term "protective" modifies
"sheath" such that the "sheath" is configured to perform the function of

21

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
protecting other structure(s). The Examiner states that "heater element 40
performs the function of being 'protective' of resilient material 35 due to
their relative locations." Ans. 31-32; see also Haines, Fig. 3. Appellants
have not shown error in that finding. See Schreiber, 128 F.3d at 1478.
Appellants contend that "protective implicates structure to the claimed
sheath" (Reply Br. 3), but do not explain how "protective sheath"
distinguishes over element 40. Further, as noted by the Examiner, "the
flexibility of a material does not necessarily negate its ability to provide
protection, and the lack of exposure does not negate its serving the function
and/or having the structure of a sheath." Ans. 32.
For these reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 1 as unpatentable
over Haines and Lofstrom. Because the reasoning and certain findings of
fact differ from those of the Examiner (based on the arguments relied upon
from Rejections 7 and 2), we designate our affirmance of this Rejection as a
new ground of rejection under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) to provide Appellants
with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the Rejection, as modified.

DECISION
We AFFIRM the decision to reject claims 1-3, 5-10, 12-19, 24, and
26, and designate each affirmance as a NEW GROUND OF REJECTION
pursuant to our authority under 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b).

FINALITY OF DECISION
This decision contains a new ground of rejection pursuant to
37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b). Section 41.50(b) provides "[a] new ground of

22

Appeal2014-007463
Application 12/620,537
rejection pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered final for judicial
review." Section 41.50(b) also provides:
When the Board enters such a non-final decision, the appellant,
within two months from the date of the decision, must exercise
one of the following two options with respect to the new ground
of rejection to avoid termination of the appeal as to the rejected
claims:
( 1) Reopen prosecution. Submit an appropriate
amendment of the claims so rejected or new Evidence relating to
the claims so rejected, or both, and have the matter reconsidered
by the examiner, in which event the prosecution will be
remanded to the examiner. The new ground of rejection is
binding upon the examiner unless an amendment or new
Evidence not previously of Record is made which, in the opinion
of the examiner, overcomes the new ground of rejection
designated in the decision. Should the examiner reject the claims,
appellant may again appeal to the Board pursuant to this subpart.
(2) Request rehearing. Request that the proceeding be
reheard under§ 41.52 by the Board upon the same Record. The
request for rehearing must address any new ground of rejection
and state with particularity the points believed to have been
misapprehended or overlooked in entering the new ground of
rejection and also state all other grounds upon which rehearing
is sought.
Further guidance on responding to a new ground of rejection can be
found in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure§ 1214.01.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED; 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b)
