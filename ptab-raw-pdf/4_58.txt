Before JOHN A. JEFFERY, JAMES R. HUGHES, and
MONICA S. ULLAGADDI, Administrative Patent Judges.
JEFFERY, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
decision to reject claims 1, 2, 4---6, 8-12, 14, and 17-20. Claims 3, 7, 13, 15,
and 16 were cancelled. See Amd't filed May 22, 2014 (indicating these
claims were cancelled). We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). We
affirm.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants' invention bypasses low-yield or dead cache memory units
to improves reliability and performance. See generally Abstract; Spec.
i-fi-1 4--7; Figs. 2-3. Claim 1 is illustrative:

1. A bypass memory system, comprising:

Appeal2015-002646
Application 12/276,072
a first memory unit mounted on a bus;
a first cache manager coupled to the first memory unit;
a second memory unit mounted on the bus;
a main controller mounted on the bus and coupled to the first cache
manager and a second cache manager;
the first cache manager being operable to: receive a request
originating from a first set of sub-processing elements to a first set of submemory elements that is operational yet unable to satisfy the request, the
first set of sub-memory elements and the first set of sub-processing elements
coupled to the first memory unit and located on a lower hierarchical level
than the first memory unit, bypass the first memory unit with the request
when the first memory unit is exhibiting a yield below a predetermined
threshold, and send the request to the second memory unit via the bus; and
the second cache manager coupled to an input and an output of the
second memory unit, the second cache manager being operable to receive
the request from the first cache manager via the bus, and to manage
operation between the second memory unit and a second set of subprocessing elements by sending the request to either of the following: the
second memory unit, and an externally located third memory unit in the case
that the second memory unit fails to satisfy the request.
THE REJECTION
The Examiner rejected claims 1, 2, 4---6, 8-12, 14, and 17-20 1 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Vartti (US 7,260,677 Bl; issued
Aug. 21, 2007) and Manu Thapar et al., Scalable Cache Coherence for

1

Although the Examiner's statement of the rejection lists only cancelled
claims 3, 15, and 16, the Examiner nonetheless omits these claims in the
corresponding discussion that addresses claims 1, 2, 4---6, 8-12, 14, and 1720. Compare Ans. 2 with Ans. 5-8. Notably, Appellants acknowledge that
these latter claims-not claims 3, 15, and 16--are subject to the appealed
ground of rejection. Br. 6. We, therefore, present the correct claim listing
here for clarity, and treat the Examiner's error in this regard as harmless.
We likewise deem harmless the Examiner's erroneously including cancelled
claims 7 and 13 in the rejection's discussion. See Ans. 6-7.

Shared Memory Multiprocessors,

PROC. ACPC CONF. PARALLEL COMP.

(1991) ("Thapar"). Ans. 2-8. 2

CONTENTIONS
The Examiner finds that Vartti discloses every recited element of
claim 1 including a "first memory unit" (shared cache 206 of Processor
Node Director (PND) 102A) and a "first cache manager" (PND 102A)
coupled thereto, where the first cache manager receives a request originating
from a "first set of sub-processing elements" (Instruction Processors (IPs)
1 lOA-D) to a "first set of sub-memory elements" (Second-Level Caches
(SLCs) 108A-D) that is operational yet unable to satisfy the request, the first
set of sub-processing elements located on a lower hierarchical level than the
first memory unit. Ans. 2-3, 10-13 (citing Vartti Figs. 1-2).
According to the Examiner, V artti' s first cache manager also ( 1)
bypasses the first memory unit with the request when this memory unit
exhibits a yield below a predetermined threshold, and (2) sends the request
to a second memory unit, namely shared cache 206 for PND 102B as well as
Storage Coherency Director (SCD) 100. See Ans. 2--4, 13.
Although the Examiner acknowledges that Vartti does not explicitly
teach (1) a bus; (2) the second memory unit receiving the request via the
bus; and (3) the recited main controller, the Examiner cites Thapar as
teaching these features in concluding that the claim would have been
obvious. Ans. 3-5.

2

Throughout this opinion, we refer to the Appeal Brief filed September 18,
2014 ("Br.") and the Examiner's Answer mailed November 3, 2014
("Ans.").
3

Appeal2015-002646
Application 12/276,072
Appellants argue that V artti and Thapar fail to disclose a request
originating from a first set of sub-processing elements and intended for a
first cache memory unit operating below an acceptable threshold, and
sharing the request to a second cache manager ( 1) after a miss at the first set
of sub-processing elements; and (2) when the first cache memory unit
operates below an acceptable threshold. Br. 11-12. According to
Appellants, Vartti' s request not only originates from the shared SCD above
the cache-not from sub-processing elements on a lower level-but Vartti
also assumes that the SLCs can satisfy the request. Br. 13.

ISSUE
Under§ 103, has the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1 by finding
that Vartti and Thapar collectively would have taught or suggested the
recited first cache manager operable to perform its three recited functions?

ANALYSIS
We begin by noting that the Examiner's reliance on the secondary
reference to Thapar is undisputed, as is the cited references' combinability.
Rather, as noted above, this dispute turns solely on the Examiner's reliance
on Vartti for teaching the recited first cache manager and its associated
functionality. Therefore, we confine our discussion to Vartti.
Turning to claim 1, the first cache manager has three main functions,
namely (1) receiving a request originating from a first set of sub-processing
elements to a first set of sub-memory elements; (2) bypassing the first
memory unit with the request when that unit exhibits a yield below a

4

Appeal2015-002646
Application 12/276,072
predetermined threshold; and (3) sending the request to a second memory
unit via a bus.
On this record, we see no error in the Examiner's finding that Vartti' s
"first cache manager," namely PND 102A, is operable to perform the three
recited functions. See Ans. 2-3, 10-13 (citing Vartti Figs. 1-2). First,
Vartti's IP 1 lOA in Figure 1 sends a request to access a particular memory
address to its first level cache (PLC) and, if unsuccessful, to the SLC 108,
namely the "first set of sub-memory elements" under the Examiner's
mapping. See Vartti, col. 6, 11. 51-64; Ans. 10. If the SLC cannot satisfy the
request, the SLC forwards the request to the processor bus 104A where it is
monitored, or "snooped," by PND 102A. See Vartti, col. 6, 11. 48---64. This
request "snooping" at least suggests that the PND receives that request,
particularly since the PND can later forward the request to SCD 100. See
Vartti, col. 6, 1. 65 - col. 7, 1. 3. Accord Ans. 12 (noting that claim 1 does
not preclude the first cache manager's receiving the request by snooping).
And as shown in Vartti' s Figure 1, both sets of sub-processing elements (IP
1 lOA) and sub-memory elements (SLC 108A) are located on a lower
hierarchical level than the "first memory unit," namely PND 102A's cache
memory 206 in Figure 2.
Appellants' contention that Vartti' s original request originates from
the shared SCD above the cache, and not from lower-level sub-processing
elements (Br. 13), is unavailing, for it ignores the request that originates
from Vartti's lower-level IP 1 lOA noted above and by the Examiner. Ans.
11-13.
Second, V artti at least suggests that the first cache manager (PND
102A) bypasses the first memory unit (PND 102A's cache memory 206)

5

Appeal2015-002646
Application 12/276,072
with the request when that memory unit exhibits a yield below a
predetermined threshold. As Vartti explains, if PND 102A cannot satisfy the
request because it does not have the most recent copy of the requested data
stored in its shared cache logic 106A-logic that includes cache memory
206 (the "first memory unit") as shown in Figure 2-PND 102A forwards
the request to SCD 100.
Therefore, by forwarding the request to the SCD in this scenario, the
first memory unit (cache memory 206) is effectively bypassed. That such a
scenario could occur due to the cache memory 206's unavailability or
degradation in light of Vartti's column 14, lines 39 to 41 as the Examiner
indicates (see Ans. 13) at least suggests that the first memory unit would
exhibit a yield below a predetermined threshold under these conditions.
Appellants' arguments regarding the particulars of Vartti's cache-not-present
mode (Br. 12-13) are unavailing, for they are not germane to the limited
purpose for which Vartti was cited in this regard, namely merely to show
that a PND' s cache can be unavailable due to degradation or otherwise, and
that such a low-yield condition could cause that memory unit to be bypassed
in light of the above-noted functionality in Vartti's columns six and seven.
Lastly, Vartti at least suggests that the first cache manager (PND
102A) sends the request to the second memory unit (cache memory 206 for
PND 102B) by forwarding the request to the SCD. See Vartti, col. 6, 1. 65 col. 7, 1. 52. Not only can the SCD satisfy the request via its own memory
unit, but if unsuccessful, the SCD sends a request to another processing node
and associated PND that contains a cache memory unit 206 as shown in
Vartti's Figure 2. See id. Based on this functionality, Vartti at least suggests
sending the request to PND 102B and its associated memory unit after

6

Appeal2015-002646
Application 12/276,072
bypassing the first memory unit of PND 102A. The Examiner's findings
and conclusions in this regard (Ans. 2-3, 13) are, therefore, reasonable and
have not been persuasively rebutted.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the Examiner erred in
rejecting claim 1, and claims 2, 4---6, 8-12, 14, and 17-20 not argued
separately with particularity. 3

CONCLUSION
The Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 1, 2, 4---6, 8-12, 14, and
17-20 under § 103.

DECISION
The Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1, 2, 4---6, 8-12, 14, and 1720 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
AFFIRMED

3

Although Appellants nominally argue claims 10 and 14 separately (Br. 14-20), Appellants reiterate arguments made for claim 1. We, therefore, group
these claims accordingly.
