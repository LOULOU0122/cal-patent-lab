DISCUSSION
We adopt the Examiner's findings of fact, reasoning on scope and
content of the prior art, and conclusions set out in the Final Action and
Answer.

The rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Gribbon and Sowden.
The Examiner has established a prima facie case for the obviousness
of claims 37 and 75 over Gribbon and Sowden. Id. 4--9. Appellants do not
contend that Gribbon and Sowden, together, fail to disclose each element of
claims 37 and 7 5. Instead, Appellants argue that a person of ordinary skill in

the art would not have combined the disclosures of Gribbon and Sowden to
provide a water soluble polymer (e.g., a filler) to the controlled release
device, as recited by the claims, and as otherwise disclosed by Gribbon.
App. Br. 6.
Appellants' argument hinges on their contention that Gribbon' s active
ingredient must be co-amoxiclav (amoxycillin trihydrate and potassium
clavulanate), which Appellants contend is extremely hygroscopic and prone
to degradation even in the presence of low amounts of humidity, therefore,
requiring its combination with the filler microcrystalline cellulose (sold
under the trade name Avicel), which Appellants contend is uniquely suitable
for such combination because it has a moisture content of not more than 1.53%. App. Br. 6-7; Reply Br. 4--5. Appellants contend other fillers, such as
Sowden's disclosed dextrin (which Appellants argue has a moisture content
of 8-10%), are not suitable for combination with the co-amoxiclav of
Gribbon because their moisture contents are too high. Appellants'
arguments are not persuasive for several reasons.
First, Gribbon does not limit active ingredients to only co-amoxiclav.
Gribbon discloses that the active ingredient of its invention is preferably
amoxicillin I clavulanic acid, but, more broadly discloses, "[i]n preferred
embodiments of the invention the active ingredients, especially antibiotics,
preferably clavulanate, are combined with the trehalose as a preliminary step
before blending with the other components for tabletting." Gribbon col. 2,
11. 10-32. Gribbon also states that its "invention relates to dosage forms for
pharmaceutical preparations of antibiotics, particularly but not exclusively
incorporating the active ingredients potassium clavulanate and amoxycillin

4

Appeal2015-000769
Application 10/900,415

trihydrate." Id. at col. 1, 11. 5-8. Therefore, any antibiotic may be Gribbon's
active ingredient, e.g., an antibiotic that is more tolerant of moisture than coamoxiclav, and Appellants' argument that polymers/fillers that may be
combined with Gribbon's tablet formulation are limited to a specific
moisture content and/or limited to microcrystalline cellulose is unpersuasive.
Second, Sowden discloses "starch hydrolysates, which include
dextrin" (a "water-soluble compressible carbohydrate[]") can be substituted
for microcrystalline cellulose (i.e., Avicel; a "water-insoluble, plastically
deforming material[]") as a suitable filler for modified release dosage forms
of pharmaceutical delivery devices. Sowden i-fi-f 12, 40. This expressly
suggests that the dextrin of Sowden could be substituted for the
microcrystalline cellulose of Gribbon as a suitable "low moisture content"
filler (there is no evidence of record as to what a skilled artisan would
consider to be the threshold moisture content of such a filler). Therefore, it
would have been obvious to substitute dextrin in place of microcrystalline
cellulose in the formulation(s) disclosed by Gribbon with respect to the
recited "water soluble polymer" elements of claims 37 and 75.
Third, Sowden discloses that the active ingredient for its modified
release dosage forms can be an antibiotic, including amoxicillin. See id.
i124. Sowden teaches that a suitable filler for combining with such an active
ingredient is dextrin. Id. i1 40. Therefore, the skilled artisan would
understand that the water soluble polymer dextrin could be combined with
the other components disclosed by Gribbon, including an antibiotic active
ingredient.

Appeal2015-000769
Application 10/900,415

For the above reasons, we find that the preponderance of evidence of
record supports the Examiner's determination that the claims would have
been obvious over Gribbon and Sowden. We affirm the rejection.

The rejection under 35 U.S. C. § 112, fourth paragraph.

The Examiner has established that dependent claim 42 fails to further
limit the subject matter of the claim from which it depends. Rejection 9-10.
Appellants state that "dependent claim 42 will be cancelled once the
substantive issues relating to obviousness are dealt with." App. Br. 10-11.
We, therefore, summarily affirm this rejection.

The rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Ohkouchi

The Examiner has established a prima facie case that claims 37 and 75
would have been obvious over Ohkouchi. Rejection 10-11. Appellants do
not contend that Ohkouchi fails to disclose each element of claims 37 and
75. Instead, Appellants argue the claims are directed to a "controlled
release" device or medicament and that this claim language distinguishes the
invention from the "quickly disintegrating" solids disclosed by Ohkouchi.
App. Br. 11 and 13. The evidence of record does not support Appellants'
proposed claim language interpretation or the related argument.
The Examiner contends the Specification does not define the term
"controlled release" and the broadest reasonable interpretation of this term,
consistent with Applicants' disclosure at, e.g., i-fi-f 14 and 51 of the published
version of the Specification (US 2006/0024361 Al, published Feb. 2, 2006),
is any rate of release that is controlled. Rejection 10. We find this is a

6

Appeal2015-000769
Application 10/900,415

reasonable interpretation of the claim language-Appellants do not point to
any persuasive evidence to the contrary.
Appellants provide no evidence that a drug release device designed to
quickly disintegrate in a controlled manner, e.g., under the influence of
certain liquids, would not have been considered to be a controlled release
device by the skilled artisan. It is well settled that arguments of counsel
cannot take the place of factually supported objective evidence. See, e.g., In
re Huang, 100 F.3d 135, 139--40 (Fed. Cir. 1996); In re De Blauwe, 736

F.2d 699, 705 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Ohkouchi disclosed its "invention relates to
solid preparations that disintegrate quickly in the presence of saliva or a
small amount of water in the oral cavity," therefore, the reference teaches
controlling the release of an active ingredient, i.e., a controlled release
device. Ohkouchi col. 1, 11. 6-10. Therefore, Appellants' argument is not
persuasive.
In addition, claims 60-64, which depend from claim 37, recite that the
controlled release device can provide "sustained release," "pulsed release,"
or "delayed release," or "modulates the release of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient in order to produce multiple peaks." That dependent claims limit
the device of claim 37 to one of several different types of controlled release
devices, one of which is a "sustained release" device, belies Appellants'
argument that "controlled release" is interchangeable with "sustained
release." App. Br. 11-12; cf Reply Br. 6 (argument modified to
"[s]ustained release is a category of controlled release."). A claim
construction that results in a dependent claim having the same scope as the
independent claim from which it depends, and which thus renders the

7

Appeal2015-000769
Application 10/900,415

dependent claim superfluous, is "presumptively unreasonable."

Beachcombers, Int 'l Inc. v. Wildewood Creative Prods., Inc., 31 F .3d 1154,
1162 (Fed. Cir. 1994). For this reason also, Appellants' argument is not
persuasive.
For the above reasons, we find that the preponderance of evidence of
record supports the Examiner's determination that the claims would have
been obvious over Ohkouchi. We affirm the rejection.
