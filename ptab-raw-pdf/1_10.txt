THE CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to "a roller grill or griddle for heating and/or
reheating precooked food product." Spec. i-f 1. Claims 1 and 25 are
independent. Appeal Br. 9. Claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative of the
claimed subject matter:
A roller grill, comprising:
a housing structure adapted to support the roller grill;
a plurality of tubular heating surfaces mounted between a
first end of the housing structure and a second end of the housing
structure;
a first side housing coupled to the first end of the housing
structure;
a second side housing coupled to the second end of the
housing structure, at least one of the first side housing or the
second housing comprising a pressurized plenum maintainable
at a plenum air pressure that is greater than a tubular air pressure
of an inner volume of the plurality of tubular heating surfaces;
and
a drive assembly at least partially enclosed in the first side
housing or the second side housing, the drive assembly
configured to rotatably drive the plurality of tubular heating
surfaces.

REJECTIONS
The Examiner made the following rejections:
1.

Claims 1, 11, 25, and 34 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103(a) as being unpatentable over Hunot and Othmer.
2.

Claims 2, 3, 6, 7, 26, 27, 30, and 31 stand rejected under

35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being unpatentable over Hunot, Othmer, and Archer.
3.

Claims 4, 5, 28, and 29 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)

as being unpatentable over Hunot, Othmer, Archer, and Tomita.
4.

Claim 8 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being

unpatentable over Hunot, Othmer, and Huegerich.
5.

Claims 9 and 32 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as

being unpatentable over Hunot, Othmer, and Lee.
6.

Claims 10 and 33 stand rejected under 35U.S.C§103(a) as

being unpatentable over Hunot, Othmer, Lee, and Brown.
7.

Claims 12 and 35 stand rejected under 35U.S.C§103(a) as

being unpatentable over Hunot, Othmer, and Schmid.
Appellant seeks our review of these rejections.

ANALYSIS
In Rejections 1-7, the Examiner finds that Hunot discloses the
"pressurized plenum" limitation recited in independent claims 1 and 25. The
Examiner and Appellant dispute the meaning of "plenum." Citing to one
dictionary, the Examiner states the definition of plenum is a "condition,
space, or enclosure in which air or other gas is at a pressure greater than that
of the outside atmosphere." Final Act. 3, fn. 1 (citing

3

Appeal2016-007145
Application 14/177 ,997
<http://www.thefreedictionary.com/plenum>). The Examiner also states
that:
the definition taken on by the Examiner is consistent with that of
the Applicant's specification since Applicant's specification
recites "the pressurized plenum may be substantially sealed
against unwanted air leakage out of the plenum (e.g., into an
ambient environment) while also allowing some airflow out of
the plenum" (see Applicant's specification para. 0042).
Examiner interprets Applicant's pressurized plenum as having a
positive pressure that is capable of being greater than the ambient
environment."
Adv. Act. 3 (mailed November 30, 2015).
In response, Appellant, citing to another dictionary, disagrees with the
Examiner's definition, asserting that:
The meaning of "plenum," as one of ordinary skill in the art
would understand in view of the present disclosure, carries with
it no implied relative pressure differential from atmospheric, and
is simply, for example, "an air-filled space in a structure." [citing
to
http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plenum.]
Indeed, Appellant's meaning is in accord with the present
disclosure, which, in some embodiments, describes a
"pressurized plenum" as a plenum in which an air pressure is
maintained "greater (e.g., slightly or significantly) than an air
pressure of the heating tubes (e.g., an air pressure of an interior
volume of the tubular heating surfaces)." Application at [0042].
Thus, in accord with the present disclosure, the bare term,
"plenum," includes no implied relative pressure differential from
atmospheric (or any other relative point).
Appeal Br. 13.
In addition to Appellant's assertion that air pressure in the plenum
may be greater than the pressure in the heating tubes, the Specification also
states the air pressure may be the same. Spec. i-f 42 ("the air pressure in a
pressurized plenum of the roller grill may be equal to the air pressure inside
4

Appeal2016-007145
Application 14/177 ,997
the heating tubes to prevent or help prevent the heat (e.g., generated by an
electric resistance heater positioned in the interior volume of the tubes) from
escaping into the plenum rather than the tube surface and into food
product."). In light of these passages, the Examiner's proposed definition is
inconsistent with the Specification's usage of the term.
The Examiner's proposed definition that a plenum must have an
internal pressure that is greater than outside pressure is also inconsistent with
the "pressurized plenum" limitation in claim 1. If a plenum must be
pressurized, as defined by the Examiner, than the term "pressurized" is
redundant- claim 1 could merely recite a "plenum," and would not need to
recite a "pressurized" plenum. Based upon the usage of the term plenum in
the Specification, the broadest reasonable interpretation of plenum is an airfilled space in an enclosed structure.
Turning to Hunot, the Examiner states that paragraph 56 of Hunot
discloses "a 'pressurized plenum' since Hunot teaches 'housing (24)
comprises ... two generally rectangular side support frames 46 and 48' in
paragraph 0056." Ans. 3--4. While Hunot discloses a plenum- an airfilled space in an enclosed structure, the Examiner does not explain how or
why this plenum is pressurized, as recited in claim 1. Contrary to the
Examiner's finding that Hunot's plenum is pressurized, Hunot explicitly
states that "[s]heet 44 can have vent holes (not shown) formed therethrough
for allowing air circulation from the exterior to within the interior of the
housing 24." Hunot i-f 56. Thus, the vent holes expose the plenum to outside
atmospheric air conditions, and the internal plenum is not pressurized. Even
under the Examiner's proposed definition of plenum, Hunot's internal space

5

Appeal2016-007145
Application 14/177 ,997
is not, and cannot be, pressurized so that its internal pressure is larger than
the outside pressure.
For these reasons, the Examiner's finding that Hunot discloses a
"pressurized" plenum is in error. The Examiner does not explain how the
other prior art references remedy the deficiencies of Hunot. Thus, we cannot
sustain the rejections of independent claims 1 and 25, or claims 2-12 and
26-35 which depend from claims 1 and 25.

DECISION
For the above reasons, the Examiner's rejections of claims 1-12 and
25-35 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) are REVERSED.

REVERSED
