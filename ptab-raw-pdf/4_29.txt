Appeal2015-007308
Application No. 12/677,674
Appellants' invention is a relational database including a hierarchy
table. The table includes, for each hierarchised datum, all of the data on
which it is dependent, regardless of the number of hierarchical levels
separating them, each of the data on which it is dependent being contained in
a separate record of the table which also contains the hierarchised datum.
Spec. 5. The filtering means of the database are suitable for providing a
query formulated on the basis of the hierarchy table without resorting to
tools for the multidimensional interrogation of the database that are external
to the database. Id.
Claim 1 is exemplary of the claims on appeal:
1. An installation to manage a database comprising:
a relational database that includes (a) database
filter means, stored in a server, for filtering data contained in
fields using internal algorithms to optimize the database and for
providing the data sought in response to a query formulated in
SQL language and applied directly on the relational database,
said query defining a database filter, and (b) data belonging to
at least one data hierarchy having at least three hierarchical
levels; and
interrogation means, stored in a computer, for
formulating at least one query defining the database filter
permitting the selection of the data sought by using the database
filter,
wherein said installation further comprises a hierarchy
table comprising, for each hierarchised datum:
the hierarchised datum;
all of the data on which said hierarchised datum is
dependent, regardless of the number of hierarchical levels
separating them, each of the data on which said hierarchised
datum is dependent being contained in a separate record of the
table; and

2

Appeal2015-007308
Application No. 12/677,674
an indicator of the degree of relationship representing the
distance between the hierarchical level of said hierarchised
datum and the level of each hierarchised datum on which said
hierarchised datum is dependent and/ or an indicator of the level
of hierarchical depth representing the distance between the said
hierarchical level of the hierarchised datum and the highest
level of the hierarchised data on which said hierarchised datum
is dependent, and
wherein, during an interrogation on the basis of a query
pertaining to hierarchised data, the database filter provides a
response to the formulated query, on the basis of the tables in
the database and the hierarchy table only, without resorting to
tools for the multidimensional interrogation of the database that
are external to the database.
Claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as
being unpatentable over Colossi (US 2004/0215626 Al, pub. Oct. 28, 2004)
and Byrne (US 6, 199 ,062 Bl; iss. Mar. 6, 2001 ).
ISSUES
Appellants' arguments present us with the following issues:
1.

Does Colossi disclose or suggest a relational database that

provides data sought in response to a query formulated in SQL language and
applied directly on the relational database?
2.

Does Colossi disclose or suggest a hierarchy table comprising,

for each hierarchised datum, the hierarchised datum; all of the data on
which said hierarchised datum is dependent, regardless of the number of
hierarchical levels separating them, each of the data on which said
hierarchised datum is dependent being contained in a separate record
of the table; and an indicator of the degree of relationship representing
the distance between the hierarchical level of said hierarchized datum

3

Appeal2015-007308
Application No. 12/677,674
and the level of each hierarchised datum on which said hierarchised
datum is dependent and/or an indicator of the level of hierarchical depth
representing the distance between the said hierarchical level of the
hierarchized datum and the highest level of the hierarchised data on
which said hierarchised datum is dependent?
PRINCIPLES OF LAW
One cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually
where the rejections are based on combinations of references. In re Keller,
642 F.2d 413, 425 (CCPA 1981). The test of obviousness is not whether the
features of a secondary reference may be bodily incorporated into the
structure of the primary reference, nor is it that the claimed invention must
be expressly suggested in any one or all of the references. Rather, the test is
what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested to
those of ordinary skill in the art. Id. at 425.
"The analogous-art test requires that the Board show that a reference
is either in the field of the applicant's endeavor or is reasonably pertinent to
the problem with which the inventor was concerned in order to rely on that
reference as a basis for rejection. References are selected as being
reasonably pertinent to the problem based on the judgment of a person
having ordinary skill in the art." In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 986-87 (Fed. Cir.
2006).
ANALYSIS
We are not persuaded by Appellants' argument that Colossi do not
disclose an installation in which the SQL query drafted by the user is applied
directly on the relational database. See App. Br. 4. We agree with the

4

Appeal2015-007308
Application No. 12/677,674
Examiner's finding that Colossi discloses that "traditional SQL queries may
be issued against the relational database, either directly or via a product that
generates SQL queries." Ans. 2; Colossi i-f 321.
Appellants' argument that "Colossi ... do not disclose an installation
allowing the management of hierarchized data in a rational [sic] database" is
not germane to the claimed invention. Such language is not present in the
claims under appeal. See App. Br. 5.
Appellants' argument that "Colossi do not disclose an installation
comprising a hierarchy table" which comprises "a hierarchized datum; for
each hierarchized datum, all the data it depends on; and for each
hierarchized datum and each datum it depends on, an indicator of the degree
of relationship and/or of the level of hierarchical depth between these two
data" is not persuasive of Examiner error. See App. Br. 5---6. We agree with
the Examiner's finding that Colossi discloses this limitation. Colossi
discloses metadata objects from a relational database having hierarchical
tables and indications that indicate the relationships among the related
metadata objects and their attributes. Final Act. 3, citing Colossi i-f 97.
Colossi further discloses that metadata objects are stored in a database
catalog that describes the dimensional model and OLAP constructs of
existing relational data. i-f 73. Metadata objects describe where pertinent
data is located and can also describe relationships within the base data. i-f 75.
"Other metadata objects 130 describe relationships between the base
metadata objects 130 and link these base metadata objects 130 together.
Ultimately, all of the metadata objects 130 can be grouped together by their
relationships to each other, into a metadata object called a cube model."

,-r 77.

5

Appeal2015-007308
Application No. 12/677,674
We find that these disclosures in Colossi, taken together, correspond
to the "hierarchy table ... [including a] hierarchized datum; all of the data
on which said hierarchized datum is dependent" and "an indicator of the
degree of relationship ... and/or an indicator of the level of hierarchical
depth representing the distance between the said hierarchical level of the
said hierarchical level of the hierarchised datum and the highest level of the
hierarchised data on which said hierarchized datum is dependent" recited in
claim 1.
To the extent Appellants present an argument that Byrne is not
properly combinable with Colossi because it is nonanalogous, we do not
agree with Appellants. See App. Br. 6-7. Both references are directed to
the same field of endeavor, which is also Appellants' field of endeavor.
Colossi is directed to improving the performance of database queries, and
Byrne is directed to indexing in a relational database for faster wildcard
searching.
Appellants' other arguments concerning Byrne are not germane to the
Examiner's rejection. The Examiner relied on Byrne to teach providing "a
response to the formulated query, on the basis of the tables in the database
and the hierarchy table only, without resorting to tools for the
multidimensional interrogation of the database that are external to the
database," as required by claim 1. The Examiner does not rely on the
detailed teachings of Byrne concerning queries with wildcards, complained
of by Appellants. See App. Br. 7-8. We agree with the Examiner's finding
that the combined teachings of Colossi and Byrne would have suggested
incorporating the teachings of Byrne into Colossi "to provide an optimal
data access for a particular database search algorithm." Final Act. 6.

6

Appeal2015-007308
Application No. 12/677,674
We find that the combination of Colossi and Byrne discloses or
suggests all the elements of claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. We sustain the
Examiner'sยง 103 rejection.
CONCLUSIONS
1.

Colossi discloses a relational database that provides data sought

in response to a query formulated in SQL language and applied directly on
the relational database.
2.

Colossi teaches or suggests a hierarchy table comprising, for

each hierarchized datum, the hierarchised datum; all of the data on which
said hierarchised datum is dependent, regardless of the number of
hierarchical levels separating them, each of the data on which said
hierarchised datum is dependent being contained in a separate record
of the table; and an indicator of the degree of relationship representing
the distance between the hierarchical level of said hierarchized datum
and the level of each hierarchised datum on which said hierarchised
datum is dependent and/or an indicator of the level of hierarchical depth
representing the distance between the said hierarchical level of the
hierarchized datum and the highest level of the hierarchised data on
which said hierarchised datum is dependent, as required by claim 1.
ORDER
The Examiner's rejection of claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. ยง 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
