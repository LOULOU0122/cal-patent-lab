DECISION ON APPEAL

Appeal2015-005899
Application 12/858,140
STATEMENT OF CASE

Introduction
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from a rejection of claims
1-15, 18, and 19. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).

Exemplary Claims
Exemplary claims 1 and 8 under appeal read as follows (emphasis and
bracketing added):
1.

An operation control device comprising:

[(A)] a pressure detecting portion that is provided in a display
portion that displays an input area in which character information is
input, the pressure detecting portion detecting pressure with which an
operation body depresses a display surface of the display portion to
operate the input area; and
[(B)] an operation control portion that switches an input mode
of the character information based on a change in the pressure
detected by the pressure detecting portion;
[(C)] wherein the operation control portion determines an input
of the character information that is selected by operation of the
operation body that is in contact with the display surface, when it is
detected that the pressure detected by the pressure detecting portion
has decreased by greater than or equal to a predetermined
percentage within a predetermined time period,
[(D)] wherein subsequently, the operation control portion
switches the input mode of the character information based on the
change in the pressure detected by the pressure detecting portion and
on the character information that is determined to be input,
[(E)] wherein, after switching the input mode of the character
information, a navigation through a list of selectable characters is
controlled by varying the pressure with which the operation body
depresses the display surface while maintaining the contact of the
operation body with the display surface, and

2

Appeal2015-005899
Application 12/858,140
[(F)] wherein the contact of the operation body is maintained
with the display surface during a whole time period beginning from
the determination of the character information to be input, through the
navigation through the list of selectable characters.

A computer program that comprises instructions that
command a computer to function as an operation control device
8.

compnsmg:
[(A)] a pressure detecting device that detects pressure with
which an operation body depresses a display surface of a display
portion that displays an input area in which character information is
input, the operation body operating the input area; and
[(B)] an operation control device that switches an input mode of
the character information based on a change in the pressure detected
by the pressure detecting device;
[(C)] wherein the operation control device determines an input
of the character information that is selected by operation of the
operation body that is in contact with the display surface, when it is
detected that the pressure detected by the pressure detecting device
has decreased by greater than or equal to a predetermined percentage
\~1ithin a predetermined time period,
[(D)] wherein, subsequently, the operation control device
switches the input mode of the character information based on a
change in the pressure detected by the pressure detecting device and
on the character information that is determined to be input,
[(E)] wherein, after switching the input mode of the character
information, a navigation through a list of selectable characters is
controlled by varying the pressure with which the operation body
depresses the display surface while maintaining the contact of the
operation body with the display surface, and
[(F)] wherein the contact of the operation body is maintained
with the display surface during a whole time period beginning from
the determination of the character information to be input, through the
navigation through the list of selectable characters.

Rejections on Appeal
1.

The Examiner rejected claims 1, 2, and 6-14, as being

unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over the combination of Sadler et al.
(US 2009/0046110 Al; published Feb. 19, 2009) and Kim et al. (US
2010/0017710 Al; published Jan. 21, 2010). 1
2.

The Examiner rejected claims 3 and 4 as being unpatentable

under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over the combination of Sadler, Kim, and Raguseo
(US 2007/0296615 Al; Dec. 27, 2007).
The Examiner rejected claims 5, 15, 18, and 19 as being unpatentab le
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over the combination of Sadler, Kim, and Lee (US
6,686,902 B2; issued Feb. 3, 2004). 2
Appellants' Contention 3
Appellants contend that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) because:
1\.Jm does not cons10er, in the senmg of the function (i.e.,
mode), a character information that has already been
previously determined to be input by having been selected by
the operation of the operation body upon the display surface

1

As to this rejection, claim 1 is argued separately. Separate patentability is
not argued for claims 2 and 6-14. Except for our ultimate decision, the
Examiner's rejection of these claims is not discussed further herein.
2

As to the rejections of claims 3-5, 15, 18, and 19, Appellants merely recite
the language of a particular claim and assert the cited prior art reference
does not teach or suggest the claim limitation. Without more, this fails to
constitute an argument on the merits. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv);
In re Lovin, 652 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Except for our ultimate
decision, these claims are not discussed further herein.
3

This contention is determinative as to the rejections on appeal. Therefore,
Appellants' other contentions are not discussed herein.

.... Instead, Kim makes a selection merely based on a
presently input criteria (not related to selection by meeting the
condition of decreased detected pressure) that is being made by
an initially-performed touch upon the touch screen 160.
App. Br. 16.

Issue on Appeal
Did the Examiner err in rejecting claim 1 as being obvious because
the cited references fail to describe the argued limitation?

ANALYSIS
As to the Appellants' above contention, we agree. At lines 7-11 of
page 6 of the Final Action, the Examiner relied upon Kim to teach the claim
limitation "[based] ... on the character information that is determined to be
input." The above contention challenges that finding by the Examiner. At
page 4 of the Answer, the Examiner restates this above portion of the Final
Action without repeating the argued limitation. Rather, the Examiner
substitutes "and in which the navigation through the list of selectable
characters is controlled by varying the pressure with which the operation
body depresses the display surface." We fail to see how the Examiner's
response particularly addresses Appellants' argument.

NEW GROUNDS OF REJECTION
We reject claims 8, 11, and 14 under 35 U.S.C. § 101 as being
directed to non-statutory subject matter.
These claims are directed to information in the form of a "computer
program" in the abstract without hardware and as such is not directed to one

5

Appeal2015-005899
Application 12/858,140
of the statutory categories of 35 U.S.C. § 101. See MPEP 2106; Ninth
Edition (Nov. 2015). These claims "are not directed to any tangible
embodiment of this information (i.e., in physical memory or other medium)
or claim any tangible part of the digital processing system. The claims are
instead directed to information in its non-tangible form." Digitech Image
Tech., LLC v. Elec.for Imaging, Inc., 758 F.3d 1344, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

As with the claims in Digitech, we conclude the scope of claims 8, 11, and
14 includes subject matter that does not fall within any of the categories of
eligible subject matter. Appellants' attention is also directed to 13 51 Off.
Gaz. Pat. Office 212 (Feb. 23, 2010); Subject Matter Eligibility of Computer
Readable Media.

Claim 8 recites the computer program "comprises instructions that
command a computer to function as an operation control device comprising:
a pressure detecting device ... and an operation control device ... "
(emphasis added). However, the computer, pressure detecting device, and
operation control device are not hardware structures in claim 8, but rather
describe the result when the instructions of the computer program are
implemented in a computer at some later time. That is, the pressure
detecting device and operation control device exist only at the time the
computer program is executing.

37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b)

This Decision contains a new ground of rejection pursuant to
37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b). 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) provides "[a] new ground of
rejection pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered final for judicial
review."

Appeal2015-005899
Application 12/858,140
37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) also provides that Appellants, WITHIN TWO
MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE DECISION, must exercise one of
the following two options with respect to the new grounds of rejection to
avoid termination of the appeal as to the rejected claims:
(1) Reopen prosecution.
Submit an appropriate
amendment of the claims so rejected or new Evidence relating
to the claims so rejected, or both, and have the matter
reconsidered by the examiner, in which event the prosecution
will be remanded to the examiner. ...
(2) Request rehearing. Request that the proceeding be
reheard under§ 41.52 by the Board upon the same Record ....
CONCLUSIONS
(1) Appellants have established that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claims 1-15, 18, and 19 as being unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
(2) We reject claims 8, 11, and 14 as being unpatentable under
35 U.S.C. § 101.
(3) On this record, claims 1-7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, and 19 have not
been shown to be unpatentable.
(4) Claims 8, 11, and 14 are not patentable.

Application 12/858,140

DECISION
The Examiner's rejections of claims 1-15, 18, and 19 are reversed.
Claims 8, 11, and 14 are newly rejected.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
