Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
CLAIMED INVENTION
The claims are directed to configuring a process with signed files
from a storage device by determining whether their digital certificates match
a white list or by authenticating the signed files. (Spec. Abstract.) Claim 1,
reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:
1.

A computer implemented method comprising:

scanning a storage device using a processor for one or
more signed files in response to the storage device coupling to a
machine;
determining whether a digital certificate of the one or more
signed files matches a white list stored in the machine;
in response to a determination that the digital certificate of
the one or more signed files does not match the white list stored
in the machine, authenticating the one or more of the signed files;
and
configuring the processor to access accessible files from
the storage device in response to authenticating one or more of
the signed files.
(App. Br. - Claims App'x.)

REJECTION
Claims 1-20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) based on LeMay
(US 2003/0216172 Al, publ. Nov. 20, 2003) and Wang (CN 110141447 B,
publ. Aug. 18, 2010.) (App. Br. 2-5.)

Claims 1, 7, 12
Appellants' Arguments
Regarding the claimed "determining" Appellants argue that paragraph
34 of Wang has no discemable meaning, so the obviousness rejection lacks
2

Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
sufficient clarity. (App. Br. 7-8.) Appellants also argue that Wang states
nothing regarding a digital certificate of a signed file, much less signed files
of a storage device. (App. Br. 8.) Appellants further argue Wang discloses
using digital certificates to establish secure connections between a client and
a server, which is asserted to be different from what is claimed. (Id., Reply
Br. 2.) Appellants also argue the combination of Wang and LeMay fails to
disclose the claimed "determining whether a digital certificate of the one or
more signed files matches a white list stored in the machine." (Reply Br. 2,
4.) Appellants further argue Wang says nothing regarding the digital
certificate of HTTP content data, but merely that digital certificates are used
to establish secure HTTP connections. (Reply Br. 3-5.)
Regarding the claimed "authenticating" Appellants present similar
arguments as previously mentioned and further argue that Wang does not
suggest authenticating one or more signed files, much less that the
authenticating is performed in response to a determination that the digital
certificate of the one or more signed files does not match the white list
stored in the machine. (App. Br. 9, Reply Br. 5-7.)
Appellants further argue that the Office Action fails to provide a
sufficient rationale to combine LeMay and Wang in the proposed manner.
(App. Br. 9-10, Reply Br. 7-8.) Specifically, Appellants argue LeMay is
directed to authenticating gaming machine software included in removable
media whereas Wang is directed to a different problem of establishing
communication tunnels between client and server. According to Appellants,
the stated rationale of enhancing security of the system would not have
provided sufficient reason to combine the references. (Id.)

Application 13/384,764
Legal Considerations Concerning Obviousness
The question of obviousness is resolved on the basis of underlying
factual determinations, including: (1) the scope and content of the prior art;
(2) any differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art; (3)
the level of skill in the art; and (4) where in evidence, so-called secondary
considerations. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966). A
claim is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) if the differences between
the claimed subject matter and the prior art are such that the subject matter,
as a whole, would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a
person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406 (2007) ("KSR").
With this background in mind, we proceed to analysis of Appellants'
arguments and the Examiner's findings and conclusions of obviousness.
Analysis
Although it is true that Wang has translation errors, we do not agree
with Appellants' assertion it is incomprehensible to a person of ordinary
skill in the art. For example, a person of ordinary skill would interpret
Wang, paragraph 34, as meaning: "The digital certificate analyzing means
[is provided] for judging whether the digital certificate digital certificate
digital certificate [is on the] white list or blacklist." In this regard, we note
that in an obviousness rejection "a reference must be considered not only for
what it expressly teaches, but also for what it fairly suggests." In re Bell,
991 F. 2d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 1993) quoting In re Burckel, 592 F.2d 1175,
1179 (CCP A 1979). We also note that certain of the cited paragraphs of
Wang are clear and detailed regarding the claimed subject matter. (See, e.g.,

4

Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
Wang iii! 76, 77.) Thus, we are not persuaded the reference is
incomprehensible to a person of ordinary skill.
Appellants' argument that Wang is silent concerning a digital
certificate of a signed file, but instead teaches use of a digital certificate for
an HTTPS connection, fails to take into account that the rejection is based
on the combination of Wang and LeMay. "Non-obviousness cannot be
established by attacking references individually where the rejection is based
upon the teachings of a combination of references." In re Merck & Co., 800
F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (citing In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425
(CCP A 1981 )). "The test for obviousness is not whether the features of a
secondary reference may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the
primary reference, nor is it that the claimed invention must be expressly
suggested in any one or all of the references. Rather, the test is what the
combined teachings of the references would have suggested to those of
ordinary skill in the art." Id. at 425 (citations omitted).
Applying these principles, Wang teaches digital certificates are used
to verify connection requests against white and black lists. (Final Act. 3
citing Wang if 76.) LeMay teaches performing a hash operation on a file to
generate a signature for comparison with a file signature in order to
authenticate the file. (LeMay if 76.) To enhance security, a person of
ordinary skill would have understood that Wang's digital certificates could
be applied to LeMay' s signed files to arrive at the claimed invention, as the
Examiner found. (See Final Act. 3, Ans. 2-3.)
Wang also teaches that if a digital certificate is unknown, i.e., it does
not match the white or black lists, then security checks and content-filtering
are performed on plaintext data. (Wang iii! 76, 77.) A security check
5

Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
suggests authentication as taught by LeMay. (See LeMay Figs. 5, 6.) Thus,
we are not persuaded by Appellants' argument that the claimed
"authenticating" is not suggested by the combination of LeMay and Wang.
Appellants also do not persuade us of Examiner error regarding the
rationale to combine LeMay and Wang. As the Examiner notes, LeMay and
Wang are both directed to the same field of endeavor, namely, security,
particularly in relation to connected devices. (See Final Act. 3, LeMay Title,
Abstract, Wang Title, Abstract.) "[A]ny need or problem known in the field
of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide
a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed." (See KSR at
420.) The need for file and system security would have been appreciated by
the person of ordinary skill in the art, and using LeMay's file signatures with
Wang's digital certificates would have been understood to enhance the
security of the system over and above the teachings of the individual
references. Thus, the claimed invention may be viewed as the combination
of elements known in the prior art according to known techniques under
KSR, yielding the predictable result of enhanced security. 3

Furthermore, LeMay and Wang share several features in common,
which would have suggested their combination. Both deal with security of
connected devices, and LeMay's software authentication and Wang's safety
inspection and content-filtering would be understood to be related concepts
by a person of ordinary skill in the art. (See LeMay, Title, Abstract, Wang,
Title, Abstract, i-fi-176, 77.) These observations would have suggested to the
person of ordinary skill the combination of references set forth in the

3

See MPEP ยง 2143(A) regarding the rationale of combining prior art
elements according to known methods to yield a predictable result.
6

Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
Examiner's rejection. 4 Thus, we agree with the Examiner regarding the
"apparent reason" to combine the references as described in KSR. (See Final
Act. 3, KSR at 418.)

Claim 2
Appellants argue LeMay and Wang are entirely silent regarding the
claimed limitation "wherein the digital certificate uniquely identifies a
publisher of the one or more of the signed files." (App. Br. 10-11 and
Claims App'x, Reply Br. 8-9.) The Examiner cites both LeMay and Wang
for this claimed feature. (Final Act. 3 citing Lemay i-f 76, Ans. 4 citing
LeMay i-f 72, Fig. 8 and Wang Abstract.)
In interpreting the claim language, we apply the broadest reasonable
interpretation that is consistent with the Specification. In re Am. Acad. of

Sci. Tech. Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The Specification
states "A publisher of a digital certificate is an entity which has created
and/or distributed the digital certificate or a corresponding signed file."
(Spec. i-f 30.) Thus, the entity that creates or distributes the digital
certificates in Wang or the signed files in LeMay may be regarded a
publisher. We agree with the Examiner that a person of ordinary skill would
have understood that such publisher may be uniquely identified by the
digital certificate. 5 Accordingly, we are not persuaded the Examiner errs in

4

See MPEP ยง 2143(G) regarding the teaching, suggestion, or motivation
("TSM") rationale for combining references.
5
We also note that in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) it was well-known
before the invention to use unique digital certificates to identify entities.
See, e.g., CARLISLE ADAMS & STEVE LLOYD, UNDERSTANDING PKI (2nd Ed.
2003).
7

Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
finding the references at least suggest the claimed feature. Thus, we sustain
the rejection of claim 2.

Claims 3, 10, 14
Appellants argue LeMay and Wang fail to teach or suggest the
claimed limitation "in response to authenticating the one or more of the
signed files, adding the digital certificate of the one or more of the signed
files to the white list." (App. Br. 11-12 and Claims App'x, Reply Br. 9-10.)
In finding Wang teaches this feature, the Examiner notes that when a digital
certificate is not on either the white or black list, the reference teaches that
further processing including security checks, content filtering, access policy
checks, etc. are performed. (Final Act. 3 citing Wang i-fi-f 11-16, 26-32, 44-50, Ans. 5 citing Wang i-fi-176-77.) The Examiner further finds the person of
ordinary skill would understand that when the white list was created, the
certificate had to be authenticated or authorized. (Id.) Nonetheless, these
findings fall short of teaching or suggesting that a digital certificate should
be added to a white list in response to its authentication in the claimed
context. Thus, we agree with Appellants' argument, and we do not sustain
the Examiner's rejection of claims 3, 10, and 14.

Claim 4
Appellants contend LeMay and Wang are silent regarding the claimed
limitation "wherein the accessible files include the files on the storage
device when one of the signed files is authenticated and the signed file is an
auto run file." (App. Br. 12 and Claims App'x, Reply Br. 10.) To the
contrary, the Examiner finds this limitation taught by the combination of
references, particularly in LeMay. (Final Act. 4 citing LeMay i-fi-176, 77,
Ans. 5 citing LeMay i-fi-159, 60.)

8

Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
We note that the Specification provides no definition of what is meant
by an "auto run file" and Appellants offer none in the briefs. Accordingly,
we apply the broadest reasonable interpretation of this claim terminology
consistent with the Specification. See In re Am. A cad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,
supra.

In the cited paragraphs, LeMay states upon receiving authentication
programs an algorithm processor automatically executes authentication
algorithms on the software programs on the removable media to determine
their trustworthiness. (LeMay i-f 59, 75.) We agree with the Examiner that
LeMay' s programs are equivalent to the claimed auto run file because they
run automatically without the need for user action. Accordingly, we are not
persuaded by Appellants' arguments that LeMay fails to teach or at least
suggest the claimed feature.
Claim 5

Claim 5 recites "wherein the accessible files include a subset of the
files on the storage device when one of the signed files is authenticated and
determined to be executable." (App. Br. -Claims App'x.) Appellants argue
this feature is not taught or suggested in the combined references, arguing
LeMay and Wang are silent regarding any signed file that is determined to
be executable. (App. Br. 12-13, Reply Br. 10-11.)
We agree with the Examiner this feature is taught or at least suggested
by LeMay' s disclosure. Specifically, LeMay teaches that if a decrypted
signature matches a signature calculated from a file, then a directory and
listing of files is generated. (Final Act. 4 citing LeMay i-fi-1 7 6, 77, Ans. 6
citing LeMay i-fi-159, 60, see also i-f 38.) One of ordinary skill would infer
that these actions are in preparation for file execution at the completion of

9

Appeal2015-003744
Application 13/384,764
the authentication process. Thus, in LeMay, successful file authentication
may be considered as a determination that the files are executable.
Claim 8

Claim 8 recites "wherein the authentication application operates as a
background service on the machine." (App. Br. - Claims App'x.)
Appellants argue this feature is not taught or suggested by LeMay and
Wang, which, according to Appellants, contain no suggestion of any
background service.
No definition of "background service" appears in the Specification,
and Appellants offer none in their briefing. Accordingly, we apply broadest
reasonable interpretation to the claim terminology that is consistent with the
Specification. See In re Am. A cad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr., supra.
LeMay' s authentication is a process that runs automatically without
any user intervention, i.e., it runs in the background. (Ans. 6 and Final Act.
4 citing LeMay i-fi-175, 76.) We agree with the Examiner this is encompassed
by the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claimed background service.
Thus, we are not persuaded the Examiner errs in the obviousness rejection.
Remaining Claims

No separate arguments are presented for the remaining claims and
therefore we sustain their rejection for the reasons previously stated.
