Before ELENI MANTIS MERCADER, LARRY J. HUME, and
SCOTT B. HOWARD, Administrative Patent Judges.
HUME, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is a decision on appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) of the Final
Rejection of claims 1-5, 9-16, and 20. The Examiner objects to claims 6-8
and 17-19, but otherwise indicates they are drawn to allowable subject
matter. Final Act. 9. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is Marvell World Trade
Ltd.. App. Br. 2.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 2

The Invention
Appellants' disclosed and claimed invention "relate to buffers in
general, and more specifically, to a buffer manager and methods for
managing memories." Spec.

i-f 3.
Exemplary Claim

Claim 1, reproduced below, is representative of the subject matter on
appeal (emphasis and formatting added to contested limitation):
1.

A system comprising:

a memory including a plurality of buffer locations, ones
of the plurality of buffer locations being identified by a
respective physical address and a respective virtual address,

ones of the plurality of buffer locations being configured
to store (i) a respective buffered data and (ii) the respective
virtual address that is used to identifY the buffer location;
a processor unit configured to access buffered data stored
in a respective buffer location using the respective virtual
address that is used to identify the buffer location; and
one or more client components, that are different from
the processor unit, configured to access the buffered data stored
in the respective buffer location using the respective physical
address that is used to identify the buffer location, instead of
using the respective virtual address that is used to identify the
buffer location.

Our decision relies upon Appellants' Appeal Brief ("App. Br.," filed
Nov. 5, 2014); Examiner's Answer ("Ans.," mailed Jan. 16, 2015); Final
Office Action ("Final Act.," mailed Aug. 7, 2014); and the original
Specification ("Spec.," filed Dec. 3, 2012). We note Appellants did not file
a Reply Brief to rebut the Examiner's findings and legal conclusions in the
Answer.

Prior Art

The Examiner relies upon the following prior art as evidence in
rejecting the claims on appeal:
Lary et al. ("Lary")

US 5,657,471

Tripathi et al. ("Tripathi") US 7,664,938 Bl

Aug. 12, 1997
Feb. 16,2010

Rejection on Appeal

Claims 1-5, 9-16, and 20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
being obvious over the combination of Tripathi and Lary. Ans. 2; Final
Act. 2.
CLAIM GROUPING
Based on Appellants' arguments (App. Br. 4--7), we decide the appeal
of the obviousness rejection of claims 1-5, 9-16, and 20 on the basis of
representative claim 1.
ISSUE
Appellants argue (App. Br.4--6) the Examiner's rejection of claim 1
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being obvious over the combination of Tripathi
and Lary is in error. These contentions present us with the following issue:
Did the Examiner err in finding the cited prior art combination teaches
or suggests a system that includes, inter alia, a memory with a plurality of
buffer locations, wherein "ones of the plurality of buffer locations [are]
configured to store (i) a respective buffered data and (ii) the respective
virtual address that is used to identify the buffer location," as recited in
claim 1?

ANALYSIS
In reaching this decision, we consider all evidence presented and all
arguments actually made by Appellants. We do not consider arguments that
Appellants could have made but chose not to make in the Briefs, and we
deem any such arguments waived. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
We disagree with Appellants' arguments with respect to claims 1-5,
9-16, and 20, and we incorporate herein and adopt as our own: (1) the
findings and reasons set forth by the Examiner in the action from which this
appeal is taken, and (2) the reasons and rebuttals set forth in the Examiner's
Answer in response to Appellants' arguments. We incorporate such
findings, reasons, and rebuttals herein by reference unless otherwise noted.
However, we highlight and address specific findings and arguments
regarding claim 1 for emphasis as follows.
Appellants contend the combination of Tripathi and Lary, particularly
Lary, fail to teach or suggest all the limitations of claim 1, and especially is
deficient in teaching the recited "ones of the plurality of buffer locations
being configured to store (i) a respective buffered data and (ii) the respective
virtual address that is used to identify the buffer location." App. Br. 4--5.
Appellants argue:
Because Lary's carrier stores a complex address configured to
point to a queue buffer, Lary's carrier clearly must be separate
from the queue buffer because, unless the carrier and queue
buffer are separate, there would be no meaning for an address
stored in the carrier that points to the queue buffer.
Furthermore, Lary's carrier stores a virtual address portion to
ascertain a location of the queue buffer. In view of the
foregoing, because Lary teaches a pointer that is different and
separate from the queue buffer to point from a carrier to the
4

Appeal2015-004657
Application 13/692,635
queue buffer, there is no way whatsoever that Lary can be
reasonably construed as teaching or suggesting the queue buffer
location itself as storing a virtual address that is used to identify
a location of the queue buffer, as required by claim 1.
App. Br. 5. Furthermore, "[a]s Lary fails to disclose or suggest an
embodiment in which (i) the queue buffer is integrated into the carrier
structure, (ii) as well as the carrier structure contains an information pointer
pointing to the queue buffer, Lary fails to disclose the queue buffer storing a
virtual address that is used to identify a location of the queue buffer." App.
Br. 6.
In response, the Examiner
respectfully disagrees with Applicant, because Lary clearly
discloses integrating the queue buffer into the carrier structure
(... Each message entry generally designated 50, contains a
carrier 52, 52i and may contain a queue buffer, Q BUFFER, 56,
56i . . . the Q BUFFER may be integrated into the carrier
structure ... ; col.6, lines 26-47; The queue carrier has the
virtual address, so it would have both the virtual address and
data stored in the same structure).
Ans. 10.
Appellants also argue (App. Br. 5---6) Lary's teaching of this reliedupon feature in an alternative embodiment (see Lary col. 6, 11. 40-44)
implies "that these two embodiments are mutually exclusive and there
cannot be a single embodiment that includes features from both these
embodiments." App. Br. 6.
We disagree with Appellants' arguments and find them unpersuasive
because our reviewing court has held, "[c]ombining two embodiments
disclosed adjacent to each other in a prior art patent does not require a leap

5

Application 13/692,635
of inventiveness." Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc. v. Cordis Corp., 554 F.3d
982, 991 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
Accordingly, based upon the findings above, on this record, we are
not persuaded of error in the Examiner's reliance on the combined teachings
and suggestions of the cited prior art combination to teach or suggest the
disputed limitation of claim 1, nor do we find error in the Examiner's
resulting legal conclusion of obviousness. Therefore, we sustain the
Examiner's obviousness rejection of independent claim 1, and grouped
claims 2-5, 9-16, and 20 which fall therewith. See Claim Grouping, supra.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner did not err with respect to the obviousness rejection of
claims 1-5, 9-16, and 20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over the cited prior art
combination of record, and we sustain the rejection.
DECISION
We affirm the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1-5, 9-16, and 20.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
AFFIRMED
