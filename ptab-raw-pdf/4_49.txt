STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Introduction
Appellants' claimed invention is directed to "the creation and
presentation of video-on-demand (VOD) content." Spec. i-f 3. In disclosed
embodiments, the VOD content is comprised of multiple VOD clips. Spec.

i-f 18. According to the Specification, these VOD clips may be selected, such
as from a selection presentation or menu, and played back-to-back. Spec.

i-f 19. Further, according to the Specification, the claimed invention allows
for "a user to dynamically create and present a user-specific, passive
viewing presentation." Spec. i-f 20.
Claims 1 and 64 are exemplary of the subject matter on appeal and are
reproduced below with the disputed limitations emphasized in italics:
1.

A method comprising:

receiving, by a computing device, from a user terminal, a request
for a sequence of two or more video clips from a video associated with
a single event;
organizing the sequence of the two or more video clips from the
video associated with the single event into a single video stream for
playback, and related metadata that comprises indices comprising start
and stop time codes for each of the two or more video clips;
linking one of the two or more video clips to a target uniform
resource locator (URL) linking to supplemental information associated
with the one of the two or more video clips; and

transitioning between the two or more video clips during
playback by automatically jumping to an indexed start time code of a
next video clip in the sequence.
64.

A system comprising:
a video-content server;

a client device, comprising first non-transitory computerreadable media storing computer-readable instructions that, when
executed by a first processor, cause the client device to:
2

Appeal2015-003737
Application 10/727,793
request two or more video-content clips from video
content associated with a single event;
receive the two or more video-content clips as a single
video stream for playback that comprises indices comprising
start and stop time codes for each of the two or more videocontent clips; and
automatically jump during playback to an indexed start
time code of a next video clip in the single video stream; and

a system-control device disposed between the video-content
server and the client device, comprising second non-transitory
computer-readable media storing computer-readable instructions that,
when executed by a second processor, cause the system-control device
to:
link one of the two or more video-content clips to a target
uniform resource locator (URL) linking to supplemental
information associated with the one of the two or more videocontent clips; and
execute defined and stored rules that decide if videocontent clips need to be inserted into a stream and, if so, where
in the stream the insertion will occur,
wherein the defined and stored rules constrain selection of
the video-content clips to be inserted into the stream to segments
from within a single video-content asset.

Issues on Appeal
1.

Did the Examiner err in finding the combination ofBegeja and

Holtz teaches or suggests, inter alia, "transitioning between the two or more
video clips during playback by automatically jumping to an indexed start
time code of a next video clip in the sequence," as recited in claim 1?
2.

Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of Begeja and

Holtz teaches or suggests, inter alia, one or more computing devices
configured to "detect that the identifiers [(as included in a request for video
clips)] are each associated with a particular video clip," as recited in
claim 33?

3.

Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of Begeja and

Holtz teaches or suggests, inter alia, "a system-control device disposed
between the video-content server and the client device," as recited in
claim 64?
4.

Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of Begeja,

Holtz, Logan, Blackketter, and Shiels teaches or suggests, inter alia,
"transmitting the concatenated video clips to a digital video recorder (DVR)
that stores the concatenated video clips as a single video file," as recited in
claim 65?

ANALYSIS 2
Claims 1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 16, 55, 56, 58, and 60--63

Appellants contend Begeja, as relied on by the Examiner fails to teach
transitioning between two or more video clips during playback by
automatically jumping to an indexed start time code of a next video clip in
the sequence. App. Br. 16-18; Reply Br. 2-3. In particular, Appellants
assert Begeja teaches starting a first video clip using a pointer (start time),
but that Begeja does not teach a transition to a subsequent clip by jumping to
the indexed start time of the subsequent clip. App. Br. 17-18; Reply
Br. 2-3.
The Examiner finds, and we agree, Begeja teaches that multiple video
clips may be "stitched together" and streamed to the user as one continuous

Throughout this Decision, we have considered the Appeal Brief, filed
November 17, 2014 ("App. Br."); the Reply Brief, filed February 24, 2015
("Reply Br."); the Examiner's Answer, mailed on December 24, 2014
("Ans."); and the Non-Final Office Action ("Non-Final Act."), mailed on
June 13, 2014, from which this Appeal is taken.
5

Appeal2015-003737
Application 10/727,793
program. Ans. 3 (quoting Begeja if 55). Further, the Examiner finds, and
we agree, Begeja teaches the start and end times of the clips are identified
using clip pointers. Ans. 3 (citing Begeja if 46). The Examiner finds,
therefore, as Begeja is playing a video program that has been "stitched
together," the system transitions to a subsequent clip by jumping to the start
time (as identified by the clip pointer) associated with the subsequent clip.
Ans. 3.
Additionally, although not relied upon in sustaining the Examiner's
rejection we note Begeja teaches users can skip between the video clip (i.e.,
assets) or view only portions thereof. Begeja if 25. By allowing the user to
selectively skip to different portions, we determine it would have been
obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to use the clip pointers
(indicating a clip start time) to skip to the desired video clip.
For the reasons discussed supra, we are unpersuaded of Examiner
error. Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1. Further,
we sustain the Examiner's rejections of claims 6, 7, 13, 14, 16, 55, 56, 58,
and 60-63, which depend directly or indirectly therefrom and were not
argued separately. See App. Br. 41--42.

Claims 33, 39, and 43--47

Appellants assert the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 33 for at least
the same reasons advanced by Appellants regarding claim 1. App. Br. 18.
As discussed supra, we find these arguments unpersuasive of Examiner
error.
Additionally, Appellants argue the Examiner erred because Holtz fails
to teach or suggest that one or more computing devices are configured to

6

Appeal2015-003737
Application 10/727,793
detect that the identifiers (as included in a request for the video clips) are
each associated with a particular clip. App. Br. 18-20; Reply Br. 4---6.
Although Appellants concede Holtz teaches the use of identifiers, Appellants
contend there is no teaching in Holtz of a computing device configured to
detect that the identifiers are each associated with a particular video clip.
App. Br. 20-21. In particular, Appellants argue the Examiner erred in
finding "a video director or editor" in Holtz corresponds to the claimed "one
or more computing devices." Reply Br. 6.
We are unpersuaded of Examiner error because, as the Examiner
explains, "Begeja [(not Holtz)] explicitly teaches associating an identifier
with each of the video clips and retrieving the video clips from the DVL
[(Digital Video Library)] database 165 using the identifiers." Ans. 3--4
(citing Begeja i-f 38). Thus, Appellants' arguments are unpersuasive of error
as they are not responsive to the Examiner's rejection.
In reply, Appellants respond that Begeja also fails to teach the
disputed limitation (detecting that the identifiers are each associated with a
particular video clip). Reply Br. 4--5. Appellants contend the cited portion
of Begeja uses "program identification to provide segmentation/
identification of commercials and programs." Reply Br. 5.
We disagree with Appellants' contention. As Appellants concede,
Begeja uses program identification associated with the video clips to
determine segmentation of program clips from commercial clips. Further,
Begeja teaches that this segmentation/identification is performed by a
program identification engine (i.e., a computing device). Begeja i-f 38.
For the reasons discussed supra, we are unpersuaded of Examiner
error. Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 33.

7

Appeal2015-003737
Application 10/727,793
Further, we sustain the Examiner's rejections of claims 39 and 43--47, which
depend directly or indirectly therefrom and were not argued separately. See
App. Br. 41--42.

Claims 48, 49, 52, and 54

Appellants assert the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 48 for at least
the same reasons advanced by Appellants regarding claims 1 and 33. App.
Br. 21-22. As discussed supra, we find these arguments unpersuasive of
Examiner error.
In rejecting claim 48, the Examiner referred to the rejection for
"claim 7." Non-Final Act. 7. Appellants argue the reasoning directed to the
rejection of claim 7 does not apply to claim 48 "at least because claim 48
does not recite a DVR[,]" as recited in claim 7. App. Br. 21.
The Examiner explains: "[t]he detailed rejection contains a
typographical error referring to claim 7. The rejection should read 'see
claim 33' as both claims 33 and 48 contain equivalent limitations." Ans. 4.
Appellants dispute the Examiner's statement and assert claim 48
recites, inter alia, "transmit fast-forward metadata associated with the
advertisement video clip that indicates whether skipping the advertisement
video clip is permitted and time-code metadata comprising indices
comprising start and stop time codes for each of the two or more video clips
and the advertisement video clip," which is not present in claim 33. Reply
Br. 6.
As for the specific limitation identified by Appellants, we note claim
33 recites, in part, "process[ing] fast-forward metadata associated with the
video clip from the video clip sequence to determine whether fast-

8

Appeal2015-003737
Application 10/727,793
forwarding is permitted during presentation of the video clip" and
"transmit[ting] the video clip sequence to the user terminal, the video clip
sequence comprising the two or more video clips and the advertisement
video clip." Thus, although claim 33 does not include the exact language
identified by Appellants, we agree with the Examiner that claim 33 includes
equivalent limitations to those found in claim 48.
For the reasons discussed supra, we are unpersuaded of Examiner
error. Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 48.
Further, we sustain the Examiner's rejections of claims 49, 52, and 54,
which depend directly or indirectly therefrom and were not argued
separately. See App. Br. 41--42.

Claim 64

Appellants contend the Examiner erred in finding Begeja teaches a
system-control device disposed between the video-content server and the
client device. App. Br. 22-24; Reply Br. 7-8. In particular, Appellants
assert the eClips server of Begeja, which the Examiner finds corresponds to
the claimed system-control device, is not disposed between the video server
and client.

Figure 2 of Begeja depicts "an architecture for implementing an
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.". Begeja i-f 17. The
Examiner finds eClips Server (230) corresponds to the claimed system
control device, Video Server (220) corresponds to the claimed video-content
server, and eClips Client (250) corresponds to the claimed client device.
Non-Final Act. 4.
The Examiner explains that Figure 2 "merely portrays the flow of
instructions and information throughout the system" and does not represent a
physical layout as would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the
art. Ans. 4. The Examiner further explains "the eClips server 230 receives

10

Appeal2015-003737
Application 10/727,793
user requests and coordinates reception of the clip stream from the video
server." Ans. 4 (citing Begeja i-f 47).
We find Appellants' argument persuasive of Examiner error. We
agree with Appellants that eClips Client (250) requests video clips directly
from video server 220. Reply Br. 7-8 (citing Begeja i-f 45); see also Begeja

i-f 47. Additionally, the Examiner has not provided sufficient evidence or
technical reasoning to support a finding that the eClips Server (230) is
disposed between the eClips Client (250) and Video Server (220), as
required by claim 64.
Because we find it dispositive that Begeja does not teach or suggest a
system-control device disposed between the video server and client, as
required by claim 64, we need not address other issues raised by Appellants
related to the rejection of this claim. Accordingly, on this record and for the
reasons discussed supra, we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of
claim 64.

Claims 65 and 66
Claim 65 recites, in part, "transmitting the concatenated video clips to
a digital video recorder (DVR) that stores the concatenated video clips as a
single video file." Appellants contend Begeja, as relied on by the Examiner,
fails to teach or suggest this limitation. App. Br. 28-30; Reply Br. 11. In
particular, Appellants assert Begeja teaches video content may be made
available to a client (Begeja i-f 45) or that the clips may be emailed to another
user or saved to an archive (Begeja i-f 65). App. Br. 29. Appellants argue
such teachings do not teach or suggest transmitting a concatenated clip to a
DVR. App. Br. 29.

11

Appeal2015-003737
Application 10/727,793
The Examiner responds by stating "Holtz explicitly teaches forming
rules to automatically link advertisements with specific show element by
time element." Ans. 6 (citing Holtz, col. 34, 11. 21-24).
The Examiner's response is not directed to the disputed limitation or
Appellants' rebuttal to the rejection. Thus, the Examiner has not provided
sufficient evidence or technical reasoning to support a finding that Begeja
teaches or suggests the disputed limitation of claim 65.
Because we find it dispositive that Begeja does not teach or suggest
transmitting the concatenated video clips to a DVR for storage as a single
video file, as required by claim 65, we need not address the other issues
raised by Appellants related to the rejection of this claim. Accordingly, on
this record and for the reasons discussed supra, we do not sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claim 65. Additionally, we do not sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claim 66, which depends therefrom.

DECISION
We affirm the Examiner's decision to reject claims 1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 16,
33, 39, 43--49, 52, 54--56, 58, and 60-63.
We reverse the Examiner's decision to reject claims 64--66.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.50(±).
