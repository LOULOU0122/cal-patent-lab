STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Background

The Specification discloses:
The present invention is directed to the formation of very high
density arrays that can allow simultaneous analysis, i.e. parallel
rather than serial processing, on a number of samples. This is
done by forming an "array of arrays", i.e. a composite array
comprising a plurality of individual arrays, that is configured to
allow processing of multiple samples. For example, each
individual array is present within each well of a microtiter plate.
Thus, depending on the size of the microtiter plate and the size
of the individual array, very high numbers of assays can be run
simultaneous!y.
Spec. 5:36-6:4.
[T]he invention provides composite array compositions
comprising a first substrate with a surface comprising a
plurality of assay locations and a second substrate comprising a
plurality of array locations, each array location comprising

discrete sites. The compositions further comprise a population
of microspheres comprising at least a first and a second
subpopulation, wh rein [sic wherein] each subpopulation
comprises a bioactive agent. The microspheres are distributed
on each of the array locations.
Spec. 2:32-3:6.
Claims 51-55 are on appeal. Claim 51 illustrates the subject matter
and reads as follows:
51. A process of forming a plurality of random arrays of
encoded particles on a substrate, wherein each of the arrays are
formed by random placement of encoded particles,
wherein differently encoded particles have a different label,
compnsmg:

(i) placing and confining a group of differently encoded
particles into one or more sites on a substrate having a plurality of
sites, so as to form a first confined group of particles occupying
particular sites;
(ii) recording the positions of the encoded particles within said
confined group;
(iii) placing and confining an additional group of differently
encoded particles into unoccupied sites on the substrate so as to form
an additional group of confined particles occupying particular sites;
(iv) recording the positions of particles within said additional
confined group; and repeating steps (iii) to (iv) several times so as to
form a plurality of a random encoded arrays of particles.

ANTICIPATION
We select claim 51 as representative of the rejected claims. 37 C.F .R.

§ 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
As stated in In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992):
[T]he examiner bears the initial burden ... of presenting a
prim a facie case of unpatentability ....
After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant
in response, patentability is determined on the totality of the
record, by a preponderance of evidence with due consideration
to persuasiveness of argument.
Appellants' arguments do not persuade us that a preponderance of the
evidence fails to support the Examiner's prima facie case of anticipation as
to claim 51.

placing encoded particles on the substrate. App. Br., Claims Appendix, p.
15. Each of the encoded particles has a different label that allows the
particle location to be "recorded" by detecting the label on the particle. Id.
As the Examiner found (Final Action 10 4), Walt discloses methods for
creating multiple arrays by placing and then affixing microspheres (i.e.
particles), which each contain different biological reagents for subsequent
detection (i.e. labels), into wells at the ends of a silicon optical fiber bundle.
(See Walt, abstract:

An optical fiber bundle sensor is also disclosed in which the
separate microspheres may be optically coupled to discrete
fibers or groups of fibers within the bundle. The functionalies
[sic functionalities] are encoded on the separate micro spheres
using fluorescent dyes and then affixed to wells etched in the
end of the bundle. Thus, a single sensor may carry thousands
of chemistries. Only those microspheres exhibiting reactions
then need to be decoded to identify the corresponding
functionality.)
As the Examiner found (Final Action 4), Walt discloses that the
microspheres may be randomly placed. See Walt Fig. 7A and 7B, reflecting
random placement of microspheres affixed in an array in which not every
well is occupied, and Walt 4:63---67 ("micrographs showing the array of
microspheres in their corresponding wells prior and subsequent to physical
agitation, tapping and air pulsing, demonstrating the electrostatic binding of
the microspheres in the wells.")

Office Action mailed July 10, 2013.

Appeal2014-007798
Application 12/419,218

As the Examiner found (Final Action 4), Walt discloses that the
biological reagents on the microspheres can be detected (i.e. recorded). See
Walt 3 :4 3--46 (" ... the chemical functionality on each bead is determined via
an optical signature which is encoded with a description of the chemical
functionality.") Thus, Walt discloses the steps of random placement and
affixing of differently labeled "encoded particles," and "recording" the
location of those particles.
Claim 51 also recites that the "plurality of random arrays" is created
through serial performance of the steps of "placing and confining a group of
differently encoded particles" into unoccupied sites on a multi-site substrate,
and "recording the positions of the particles within the group." App. Br.,
Claims Appendix, p. 15.
As the Examiner found (Final Action 4), Walt discloses that the
microspheres may be serially placed:
The microspheres are then placed in the wells 250 in step
276 according to a number of different techniques. The
placement of the microspheres may be accomplished by
dripping a solution containing the desired randomly mixed
subpopulations of the microspheres over the distal end 212,
sonicating the bundle to settle the microspheres in the wells,
and allowing the microsphere solvent to evaporate.
Alternatively, the subpopulations could be added serially to
the bundle end.
Walt 12:49-57 (emphasis added).

6

Appeal2014-007798
Application 12/419,218

The Examiner also found claims 17 and 21 of Walt (dependent on
claim 19) teach distributing and monitoring (i.e. recording) the beads and
serial addition of subpopulation of beads:
17. A method for constructing and using an analytic
chemistry sensor, comprising:
forming wells at terminal ends of optical fibers within a
bundle;
distributing beads carrying chemical functionalities
within the wells; and
monitoring a status of the chemical functionalities from a
proximal end of the bundle.
19. The method described in claim 17, further comprising
forming a population of beads in the wells from separate
subpopulations, each subpopulation carrying a different
chemical functionality and an optically interrogatable code
descriptive of the chemical functionality.
21. The method described in claim 19, further comprising
serially adding the subpopulations to the \vells.

The Examiner concluded that "the presently claimed method is anticipated
by the teachings of Walt et al." Final Action 4.
Appellants argue that Walt does not disclose any method that includes
at least steps "(iii) placing and confining an additional group of differently
encoded particles into unoccupied sites on the substrate" and "'repeating
steps (iii) to (iv) several times' (emphasis added)" of claim 51. App. Br. 5.
Appellants argue that a "subpopulation" of microspheres as used in Walt
refers to beads or spheres "all of which have the same functionality." Id.
According to Appellants, the teachings within Walt that the Examiner cited
for serial addition of subpopulations instead teach serial addition of a group

7

Appeal2014-007798
Application 12/419,218

of uniformly-labeled microspheres and not "a group of differently encoded
particles" that contain more than one type of label. Id. at 5-6. Therefore,
Appellants argue, Walt's "single step embodiment" does not teach the
claimed method because "Applicant's claims require at least three steps of
'placing and confining beads"' (i.e. step (i), step (iii) and the repetition of
step (iii)), and the "serial addition embodiment" of Walt does not teach
claim 51 because "the beads within each serially added 'subpopulation' of
Walt are the same whereas the particles within each serially placed 'group'
of the claims are 'differently encoded"'. Id. at 6-7. Appellants argue "the
sections of Walt cited by the Examiner disclose neither '(iii) placing and
confining an additional group of differently encoded particles into
unoccupied sites on the substrate' nor 'repeating step (iii) to (iv)."' Id.
In response, the Examiner cites to teachings in Walt that explain "the
subpopulations can be randomly mixed together" and therefore "a recitation
of 'subpopulations' (i.e. plural) encompasses randomly mixed
subpopulations." Ans. 12. We agree with Appellants that "subpopulation"
as used in Walt refers to a population of spheres or beads that contains a
single type of detectable functionality. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded
that a preponderance of the evidence fails to support the Examiner's prima
facie case of anticipation as to claim 51.
Walt discloses that arrays can be made as follows:
The microspheres are then placed in the wells 250 in step
276 according to a number of different techniques. The
placement of the microspheres may be accomplished by
dripping a solution containing the desired randomly mixed
subpopulations of the microspheres over the distal end 212,
sonicating the bundle to settle the microspheres in the wells,

8

Appeal2014-007798
Application 12/419,218

and allowing the microsphere solvent to evaporate.
Alternatively, the subpopulations could be added serially to the
bundle end.
12:49-57 (text emphasis added).
When "randomly mixed subpopulations of the microspheres" are
placed into wells via a dripped solution, the identity and distribution of the
microsphere subpopulations within the wells would necessarily be random.
As each well is "unoccupied" at the time the array making process begins,
each placement of randomly mixed subpopulations of microspheres
comprises "placing and confining an additional group of differently encoded
particles into unoccupied sites on the substrate so as to form an additional
group of confined particles occupying particular sites" as recited by claim
51. Thus, Walt discloses repeating steps (i) and (iii) multiple times to create
"a plurality of a random encoded array of particles" as recited by claim 51.
ii.Jthough \Valt does not teach the monitoring/recording step after each
addition of randomly distributed microsphere subpopulations to the wells,
this does not preclude a finding of anticipation because claim 51 is not so
limited. That is, the monitoring/detecting step can be performed subsequent
to the distribution of the particles as disclosed in Appellants' Specification:
It should be noted that while most of the methods described

herein add the beads to the substrate prior to the assay, the order
of making, using and decoding 11 the array can vary. For
example, the array can be made, decoded, and then the assay
done. Alternatively, the array can be made, used in an assay,

11

Although claim 51 recites "recording," the Specification uses the term
"decoding."
9

Appeal2014-007798
Application 12/419,218

and then decoded; this may find particular use when only a few
beads need be decoded.
Spec. 32:37-33:4
In view of this disclosure, we find that the recording step of claim 51
need not be performed subsequent to each step of "placing and confining an
additional group of differently encoded particles into unoccupied sites on the
substrate so as to form an additional group of confined particles occupying
particular sites." See In re Hampel, 162 F.2d 483, 485-86 (CCPA 1947)
("There is nothing in the instant record which indicates that the particular
order of steps produces results differing in any way from those which would
be brought about if another order of steps were followed.") With this
interpretation, the disclosure of Walt, e.g., claims 17, 19 and 21, teaches
every step of the claimed invention.
Furthermore, in considering the disclosure of a reference for

anticipation, it is proper to take into account not only specific teachings of
the reference but also the inferences that one skilled in the art would
reasonably be expected to draw therefrom. In re Preda, 401 F.2d 825, 826
(CCP A 1968). We find the disclosure of Walt, and in particular, claims 17,
19 and 21, teach the ordinary artisan that the steps of creating an assay for
use in the method of claim 51 can be performed in a different sequence as
desired. In sum, for the reasons discussed, Appellants' arguments do not
persuade us that the Examiner erred in finding that Walt describes a method
for forming a plurality of random arrays that has all of the features required
by claim 51. Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner's rejections of claim 51

10

Appeal2014-007798
Application 12/419,218

as anticipated by Walt. Because they were not argued separately, claims 5255 fall with claim 51. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
OBVIOUSNESS
In rejecting claims 51-55 for obviousness over Kedar and Walt, the
Examiner relied on Kedar as a reference that teaches all elements of claim
51 except fixing beads onto a support. Ans. 5-7. The Examiner additionally
relied on the teachings of Walt discussed above, including the teaching on
"fiber optic supports wherein the beads can be fixed onto wells etched into
each fiber of the fiber optic bundle." Id. at 7. We agree with the Examiner's
conclusions regarding the scope and content of the prior art and adopt them.
Appellants argue that Kedar discloses neither "placing and confining
an additional group of differently encoded particles into unoccupied sites on
the substrate" nor ordered step "'(ii) recording the positions of the encoded
particles within said confined group' of Claim 51." App. Br. 9-11.
Appellants reiterate their argument that Walt fails to teach these steps (id. at
11) and further argue one of skill in the art would not modify the process of

Kedar to use the methods of Walt because doing so would render the Kedar
process "unsuitable for its intended purpose." Id. at 12.
As discussed above, Appellants do not persuade us that Walt lacks
any of the limitations of claim 51. Accordingly, because Appellants'
arguments do not identify any deficiency in the Examiner's obviousness
rejection of claims 51-55 for obviousness over Walt, we affirm the rejection.
In addition, we find that even if Walt were found not to meet all of the
limitations of claim 51 for failure to repeat the claimed steps as argued by
Appellants, we find that claim 51 would still have been obvious to one of

11

Appeal2014-007798
Application 12/419,218

ordinary skill in the art. See PerfectWeb Techs., Inc. v. InfoUSA, Inc., 587
F.3d 1324, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("performing the recited prior art method
of steps [] more than once [as required by the claimed method] was one of
the 'inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill would
employ" (citing KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418).

OBVIOUSNESS-TYPE DOUBLE PATENTING
Appellants do not contest or address the obviousness-type double
patenting rejections. Therefore, we summarily affirm, and will not further
discuss, these rejections. See Manual of Patent Examining Procedure §
1205.02 ("If a ground of rejection stated by the examiner is not addressed in
the appellant's brief, appellant has waived any challenge to that ground of
rejection and the Board may summarily sustain it.").
SUMMARY
For the reasons discussed, we affirm the rejection of claim 51 on the
ground of anticipation by Walt. Claims 52-55 have not been argued
separately and therefore fall with claim 51. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
