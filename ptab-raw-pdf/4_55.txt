DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARil...JG
INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. ยง 41.52, Appellants submitted a Request for
Rehearing (filed July 14, 2016) ("Request," "Req. Reh'g."). Appellants
request rehearing of the Decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board
("Board") mailed May 25, 2016 ("Decision," "Op."), in which we
REVERSED the final rejection and entered a NEW GROUND OF
REJECTION for Claims 21, 22, 25, 27, and 28 under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as
being obvious over Lee and Drerup as set forth in the rejection of Claims 21
and 26 in the Final Action mailed August 6, 2009.
The Request alleges that the Board misapprehended and overlooked a
number of points previously argued by Appellants in the Appeal Brief. Req.

Reh' g. 1. We disagree.

ANALYSIS
CLAIM21
Claim 21, the only independent claim, recites:
21. A method for managing device access to a priority-based
shared bus among a plurality of bus master devices having
different priorities and a central processing unit, comprising:
setting the central processing unit to have a highest
priority access to the shared bus;
using a timer to establish a predetermined period of time;
sending a plurality of bus request signals by the central
processing unit for requesting access to the shared bus;
sending a predetermined number of bus grant signals by a
bus arbiter during the predetermined period of time for
responding to the bus request signals and granting the central
processing unit to use the shared bus; and
setting the central processing unit to have a lower priority
access to the shared bus than at least one of the plurality of bus
master devices, in response to a predetermined number of bus
grant signals within the predetermined period of time.
Appellants contend that the Board misapprehended the recitation "using a
timer to establish a predetermined period of time." Request 1. Appellants
maintain that the Board adopted the interpretation found by the Examiner in
the Final Action of August 6, 2009. Id. at 2. Appellants argue that this
interpretation for the term "timer" ignores its plain and ordinary meaning, as
would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art. Id. at 3.
Appellants argue that the Board improperly adopted the Examiner's
finding that "the bus interval BI is number of clock cycles programmed via
2

Appeal2014-008723
Application 13/175,677
an Arbitration Bus Interval (ABI) register, and expired at the end of the
interval. Thus, it is clear that the ABI register is readable as a timer to count
the predetermined period of time." Id. at 4. Appellants contend "[a]s is well
known, a register (or register circuit) is essentially a memory that holds a
single value." Id. Appellants proffer a definition for a "timer circuit" as "a
circuit that synchronizes or activates something by means of a repetitive
timing signal; specifically one that sets a circuit or device, especially a CPU,
to run at a particular rate. Id. (quoting Oxforddictionaries.com). Appellants
further argue "[s]imply stated, a register is not a timer." Id. at 5. We
disagree.
First, Appellants' argument is not commensurate in scope with the
claims which do not recite "timer circuit." See In re Self, 671 F.2d 1344,
1348 (CCPA 1982) ("[A]ppellant's arguments fail from the outset because ..
. they are not based on limitations appearing in the claims."); In re Hiniker

Co., 150 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citation omitted) (finding "the
name of the game is the claim"). Claim 21 recites "timer," not "timer
circuit," as argued.
Second, a person of ordinary skill in the claimed "managing device
access to a priority-based shared bus" arts is unlikely to consult the Oxford
Dictionary for the definition of the claimed technical term. We find it more
likely that such a worker would consult the IEEE Dictionary. Contrary to
Appellants who flatly state "a register is not a timer" (Request 5), the IEEE
defines a "timer" as a "register or storage location whose value is changed
at regular intervals in such a manner as to measure time. Synonyms: clock

register; time register. See also: watchdog timer; interval timer." IEEE

Application 13/175,677
Press (2000), T.1184 (emphasis added). Similarly for "time register See:
timer." Id. at T .1185. In view of the IEEE definition of "timer" as a
"register," we are not persuaded the Examiner errs in in finding the reference
"Arbitration Bus Interval (ABI) register" teaches the claimed "timer." Nor
are we persuaded that we err in adopting this finding by the Examiner.
We have considered Appellants' arguments raised in the Request, but
Appellants have not persuaded us that the original decision was in error.
Based on the record before us now and in the original appeal, we are
still of the view that the rejection of Claims 21, 22, 25, 27, and 28, under
35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a), should be sustained.
We have granted the Request to the extent that we have reconsidered
our Decision of May 25, 2016, but we deny the request with respect to
making any changes therein.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. ยง 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

REHEARING DENIED
