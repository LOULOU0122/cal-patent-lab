CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to a device for providing therapy to an
anatomical structure. Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed
subject matter:
1. A medical instrument configured for expanding a paranasal
sinus, the medical instrument comprising:
an articulatable shaft comprising a first end and a second
end, wherein the first end is configured to receive, during use, an
expandable disposable medical device comprising:
a sleeve adapted to receive said articulatable shaft;
a coupling member coupled to a first end of the sleeve; and
an inflatable balloon coupled to a second end of the sleeve,
the inflatable balloon being adapted for insertion into a paranasal
smus;
a flange member coupled to the shaft, the coupling
member being adapted to engage with the flange member to
removably retain the disposable medical device on the shaft
during use;
a handle portion coupled to the articulatable shaft
proximal to the second end;
a positioning member configured to move the articulatable shaft
from a first position to a second position; and
a locking member configured to lock the positioning
member so that the articulatable shaft is held in the second
position.

ANALYSIS

Claims 1and8-13 Rejected under 35U.S.C.§103(a)
over Kelley and Mikus
Appellants argue claims 1 and 8-13 as a group. Appeal Br. 10-14.
We select claim 1 as the representative claim, and claims 8-13 will stand or
fall with claim 1. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
Appellants first argue that Kelley does not disclose an "articulatable
shaft." Appeal Br. 11. Appellants argue that an articulatable shaft must have
a joint or be jointed because "articulation" means "jointed" or "having a
joint or joints." Appeal Br. 11. The Examiner has concluded that the term
articulatable means "capable of articulating, moving, bending, etc." Ans. 2.
Appellants' own selected dictionary defines "joint" as "the place at
which two things, or separate parts of one thing, are joined or united, either
rigidly or in such a way as to permit motion. " 2 Appeal Br. 11. Appellants'

The Examiner has withdrawn a rejection of claims 1---6 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b) as being anticipated by Thompson. Ans. 2.

Application 12/890,286
argument does not comport with the dictionary definition of "joint," which
does not require separate components. Further, Appellants' gives no weight
to the suffix "able." 3 We find that the common understanding to the term
"articulatable" is broad enough to encompass the structure shown in Kelley
in which a tubular structure is rendered bendable by a series of kerfs. Kelley
12: 16-18. This interpretation of the term "articulatable" is not inconsistent
with the disclosure in Appellants' Specification.
Appellants next argue that Kelley does not disclose a "locking
member configured to lock the positioning member so that the articulatable
shaft is held in the second position." Appeal Br. 12. The Examiner responds
that Kelley teaches an activation mechanism that holds and locks the
articulatable shaft in position. Ans. 5. The Examiner finds that the claim
limitation "locking member" does not recite any particular structure and that
Kelley's disclosure of a handle activation mechanism (items 326 and 418 in
Figures 4A and 6A, respectively) meets this claim limitation. Ans. 5. We
agree with the Examiner that Kelley, column 14, lines 41-59, discloses a
locking member that is configured to lock the positioning member so that
the articulatable shaft is held in the second position. Ans. 5. In connection
with Figures 4A--4B and Figures 6A-6D, Kelley states "release of the
activation mechanisms 326 and 418 after these mechanism [sic] are
deployed results in the distal section remaining in a deflected position."

"-able": "a suffix meaning 'capable of, susceptible of, fit for, tending to,
given to,' associated in meaning with the word able, occurring in loanwords
from Latin (laudable); used in English as a highly productive suffix to form
adjectives by addition to stems of any origin (teachable; photographable)."

Application 12/890,286
Kelley 14:49-52. Appellants argue that the section of Kelley cited by the
Examiner relates only to function and does not describe any specific
structures. Appeal Br. 12. However, claim 1 requires only a "locking
member" configured to perform a certain function, and the activation
mechanisms 326 and 418 of Kelley are locking members which perform the
claimed function. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the Examiner
erred.
Finally, Appellants argue that one skilled in the art would not have
combined Kelley and Mikus, because Kelly's hemostasis valve enables
rotation of the catheter about its lengthwise axis, which is inconsistent with
the Luer connection in Mikus that prevents rotation. Appeal Br. 12-13. The
Examiner relied on Mikus to teach "a flange on the inner articulatable shaft
(300) that engages with the port at the proximal end of the expandable
medical device (200)." Final Act. 4. There is no dispute that Mikus
discloses a Luer coupling. See Mikus i-f 38, Fig. lB. The Examiner responds
by noting "the purpose of a hemostasis valve is to provide a port through
which an instrument may be passed and that closes automatically upon
removal of the instrument to prevent fluid leakage." Ans. 3. Appellants'
Reply Brief does not address the Examiner's finding (Reply Br. 2-5), and
accordingly, we are not persuaded that the Examiner erred.

Claims 2-6 Rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)
over Kelley, Mikus, and Thompson.
Appellants argue claims 2---6 as a group. Appeal Br. 14. We select
claim 2 as the representative claim, and claims 3---6 will stand or fall with
claim 3. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37( c)(1 )(iv).

Appeal2014-007407
Application 12/890,286
Claim 2 depends from claim 1 and adds "wherein the locking member
comprises a pin extending from the positioning member and wherein the pin
is configured to engage one of a plurality of recesses in the handle portion."
Appeal Br., Claims App. The Examiner finds that Thompson teaches a
similar device with "a locking member (i-f 0097) comprising a friction lock
having a pin extending from the positioning member ... , a plurality of
apertures configured for engagement with the locking member, and a biasing
member (i-f 0097-0101; Figs[.] 16-18)." Final Act. 5. The Examiner
concludes that it would have been obvious to substitute the locking
mechanism taught by Thompson for that in Kelley because Thompson's
deflection and locking mechanisms are known functional equivalents to
those in Kelley. Final Act. 5. Appellants argue that because Kelley already
discloses a device that holds the position of its articulated shaft, one would
have no incentive to add the locking mechanism of Thompson to the device
of Kelley. Appeal Br. 14--15.
Appellants did not address the Examiner's finding that the locking
mechanisms in Kelley and Thompson are functional equivalents. Therefore,
we are not persuaded that the Examiner's reasoning lacks a rational
underpinning. See KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007).
Accordingly, we have not been shown that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claim 2.

Application 12/890,286

Claims 14-16 Rejected under 35U.S.C.§103(a)
over Kelley, Mikus, and Thompson.
Appellants argue claims 14--16 as a group. Appeal Br. 15-16. We
select claim 14 as the representative claim, and claims 15 and 16 will stand
or fall with claim 14. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
Appellants' only argument for reversing the rejection of claim 14 is
that the skilled artisan would not substitute the segmented articulatable shaft
of Thompson for the flexible, notched hypotube of Kelley. Appeal Br. 1516. Appellants argue that the Kelley and Thompson devices differ both in
size and flexibility as required by their principal uses. Reply Br. 6-7.
Kelley discloses that one of its deflection mechanisms is particularly small
and flexible. Kelley 9:35--45. However, Kelley also notes that the entire
device may be scaled with "no limit ... to larger or smaller sizes ... as the
particular application demands." Kelley 11: 12-16. Thompson likewise
teaches that size is variable. Thompson i-f 65. Further, Thompson teaches
that his instrument may include articulated segments of varying length and
size to allow for different applications. Thompson i-f 69. Although
Appellants argue that the different requirements for flexibility between the
two prior art devices preclude their combination (Appeal Br. 15-16, Reply
6-7), we see no support for that argument in either reference. Instead, as
noted, both references suggest varying sizes and different applications, and
accordingly the Examiner found it would have been obvious to substitute
one known element for another element providing the same function to yield
predictable results. See KSR Int'l Co., 550 U.S. at 416. For the foregoing
reasons, we have not been shown that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim
14.
