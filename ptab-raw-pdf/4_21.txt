DECISION ON APPEAL

SUMMARY
Appellants 1 appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
decision rejecting claims 9-14 and 17-28. We have jurisdiction. 35 U.S.C.

§ 6(b ).
We AFFIRM.

According to the Appellants, the real party in interest is Infineon
Technologies AG. Appeal Br. 2.

Application 12/511,835
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants describe the present invention as relating to an electrostatic
discharge (ESD) circuit with an BSD-resistant capacitor. Spec. i-f 3. Claim
9, 17, and 21 are the independent claims on appeal. Claim 9, reproduced
below with emphasis added, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:
9.

An integrated circuit arrangement comprising:

two operating potential lines that carry potentials that are
different from one another during operation of the circuit
arrangement and a capacitor connected between the operating
potential lines, said capacitor including:
a basic doping region doped in accordance with a basic
doping type;
at least one doped connection region of a same basic
doping type as the basic doping region, wherein a dopant
concentration of the at least one doped connection region is
higher than a dopant concentration in the basic doping region;
at least one extension region of the same basic doping type
as the basic doping region immediately adjacent to the at least
one doped connection region, wherein the at least one extension
region has a dopant concentration that is less than the dopant
concentration of the at least one doped connection region and
higher than the dopant concentration of the basic doping region;
an electrode region arranged at a distance from the basic
doping region;
an electrically conducting region arranged on the electrode
region; and
a dielectric arranged between the electrode region and the
basic doping region, the dielectric comprising a thin central
region and a thicker edge region, the thicker edge region being
arranged between the electrode region and at least a portion
of the at least one extension region.

REFERENCES AND REJECTIONS
The Examiner relied upon the prior art below in rejecting the claims
on appeal:
Yoo et al.
(hereinafter "Yoo")
Wu et al.
(hereinafter "Wu')
Kikuchi et al.
(hereinafter "Kikuchi")

On appeal, the Examiner maintains the rejection of claims 9-12, 14,
and 17-28 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as unpatentable over Kikuchi in view of
Yoo and Wu. Final Act. 2. As a separate ground of rejection, the Examiner
also maintains the rejection of claim 13 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
unpatentable over Kikuchi in view of Yoo and Wu. Final Act. 11; see also
Appeal Br. 10.
ANALYSIS
We review the appealed rejections for error based upon the issues
identified by Appellants and in light of the arguments and evidence produced
thereon. Cf Ex parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1075 (BPAI 2010)
(precedential) (cited with approval in In re Jung, 637 F.3d 1356, 1365 (Fed.
Cir. 2011) ("it has long been the Board's practice to require an applicant to
identify the alleged error in the examiner's rejections")). After having

In this decision, we refer to the Final Office Action mailed July 11, 2013
("Final Act."), the Appeal Brief filed March 13, 2014 ("Appeal Br."), the
Examiner's Answer mailed June 6, 2014 ("Ans."), and the Reply Brief filed
July 16, 2014 ("Reply Br.").
3

Appeal2015-004520
Application 12/511,835
considered the evidence presented in this Appeal and each of Appellants'
contentions, we are not persuaded that Appellants identify reversible error,
and we affirm the Examiner's§ 103 rejections for the reasons expressed in
the Final Office Action and the Answer. We add the following primarily for
emphasis.
The Examiner rejects claims 9-12, 14, and 17-28 as obvious over
Kikuchi in view of Yoo and Wu. Final Act. 2. Appellants do not separately
argue 10-12, 14 and 17-28. We therefore limit our discussion to claim 9.
Claims 10-12, 14 and 17-28 stand or fall with that claim. 37 C.F.R. §
41.37(c)(l)(iv) (2013).
Appellants argue that none of the cited references disclose "a
dielectric arranged between the electrode region and the basic doping region,
the dielectric comprising a thin central region and a ticker edge region, the
thicker edge region being arranged between the electrode region and at least
a portion of the at least one extension region." Appeal Br. 14. This
argument does not fairly address the thrust of the Examiner's rejection.
"[O]ne cannot show non-obviousness by attacking references individually
where, as here, the rejections are based on combinations of references." In
re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 426 (CCPA 1981).

"Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual
findings that are reviewed for substantial evidence, including what a
reference teaches and whether there would have been sufficient motivation
to combine the prior art." See In re Man Mach. Interface Techs. LLC, 822
F.3d 1282, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The Examiner relies on Kikuchi as the
primary reference and finds that it teaches an electrode region and extension
region. Final Act. 3. The Examiner finds that Kikuchi teaches a dielectric

Appeal2015-004520
Application 12/511,835
having a thicker edge region. Ans. 3; see also Final Act. 3; Yoo Fig. 6
(depicting "bird's beak area" at 414 ). The Examiner also finds that
introduction of the thicker edge region of Yoo into Kikuchi would "reduce
an overlap capacitance between the electrode region (gate electrode region)
and the doped connection region (doped drain region)." Final Act. 3; Ans.
3; see also Yoo 7:45-52 (explaining that bird's beak area permits reducing
overlap capacitance). Appellants do not present factual evidence or
arguments to persuasively rebut any of these findings. We therefore agree
with the Examiner that a preponderance of the evidence supports these
findings of fact.
Moreover, Appellants do not persuasively argue that the Examiner
erred by combining the Kikuchi and Yoo references. In the October 11,
2013, Pre-Appeal Brief Request for Review (hereinafter, "Pre-Appeal Br."),
which Appellants incorporate by reference into the Appeal Brief (see Appeal
Br. 14), 3 Appellants argue that "it would not be obvious to provide a thicker
dielectric 16 above at least portion of the diffusion region 15 of Kikuchi."
Pre-Appeal Br. 4. However, Appellants present no reasoning or facts
rebutting the Examiner's stated rationale for why it would have been
obvious to make exactly this combination (Final Act. 3). Rather, Appellants
again focus on the shortcomings of Yoo standing alone rather than arguing
against the combination. Pre-Appeal Br. 2-5. The preponderance of the
evidence supports the Examiner's obviousness conclusion based upon the
combination of references.

3

We do not reach a determination as to whether or not incorporation of such
arguments by reference is procedurally proper.
5

Appeal2015-004520
Application 12/511,835
We therefore sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 9-12, 14, and
17-28.
The Examiner also rejects claim 13 as obvious over Kikuchi in view
of Yoo and Wu. Final Act. 11. Appellants do not separately address the
patentability of claim 13. We therefore, for the reasons explained above,
also sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 13.

DECISION
For the above reasons, we affirm the Examiner's rejection of claims
9-14 and 17-28.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a).
AFFIRMED
