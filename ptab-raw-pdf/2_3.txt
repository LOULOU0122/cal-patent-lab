OPINION
A.

Introduction3 ' 4
The subject matter on appeal relates to one-component sealants that

cure at room temperature on exposure to water (the typical water content of
air is said to be sufficient to cross-link the compositions of the invention;
Spec. 23, 11. 21-22) but that are storable with the exclusion of water (id. at 1,
11. 8-10). Such one-component compositions are said to vulcanize to
elastomers at room temperature on exposure to water, and are referred to as
"RTV-1 compositions." (Id. at 11. 10-11.) The '672 Specification teaches
that the compositions of interest are based on polymers terminated by silyl
groups having hydrolyzable substituents such as OH or alkoxy groups that
may be cross-linked. (Id. at 11. 13-17.) Of particular interest are
crosslinking agents that do not give off elimination products that are
objectionable from a health standpoint. 5 (Id. at 11. 21-25.) Moreover, in
order to enable the silicone-based sealants to adhere to a multiplicity of
different substrates (id. at 11. 28-30; 24, 11. 27-33), adhesion promotors such

compounds, filed 23 May 2011 as the national stage under 35 U.S.C. § 371
of PCT/EP2009/067152, which was filed 15 December 2009, claiming the
benefit of an application filed in Germany on 23 December 2008. We refer
to the '"672 Specification," which we cite as "Spec."

An extensive Preliminary Amendment to the Specification was filed upon
entry to the national stage (pp. 2-26). Most of the amendments appear to
conform terminology and usage to American standards. A substitute
Specification does not appear to have been filed.

products which are completely free from toxic methanol." Scheim '948,

as silyl-substituted isocyanurates and epoxy-functional silanes are known
(id. at 1, 11. 30-34, citing Fujimoto [full cite infra at 5 n.8]). However, such

alkoxy-functional silane compositions are said to be unstable under storage,
and "instead cure fully within a short time when the polymer components
are mixed with the crosslinkers." (Id. at 11. 35-38; see also Spec. 29,
Comparative Example 1, reporting a composition made in accord with
Fujimoto.)
The key points are summarized in the Abstract, which reads:
Curable organosilicon compositions with good adhesion to
substrates and good workability contain [(A)] a condensable
base organopolysiloxane, [(B)] a carbamato-alkylfunctional
alkoxysilane, and [(C)] a heterocycle substituted at a
heteroatom by an alkoxysilylmethyl group.

Claims 13-21 and 23 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)
in view of the combined teachings of Bauer, Fujimoto, and
Scheim.

Discussion
Findings of fact throughout this Opinion are supported by a

preponderance of the evidence of record.
The Examiner finds that Bauer teaches, in Example 1, a condensation
reaction crosslinkable composition comprising an a,co-dihydroxysiloxane
(corresponding to component (A)) and N-(trimethoxysilylmethyl)tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine (corresponding to component (C)), as well as several
optional components. (FR 3.) The Examiner finds that Bauer does not teach
a compound corresponding to component (B) or a compound corresponding
to optional component (D). (Id. at 4, 1. 3.) The Examiner finds further that
Bauer teaches the compositions are particularly suitable for R TV
compositions as low modulus sealants. (Id. at 3, 11. 23-24.)
The Examiner finds that Fujimoto describes RTVs having compounds
corresponding to components (A), (B), and (D) (id. at 4), and concludes that
it would have been obvious to include components corresponding to (B) and
to (D) in the compositions of Bauer "because Fujimoto further teaches that
the epoxyalkoxysiloxane serves to improve adhesive properties." (Id. at 5,

11. 1-7.)
Similarly, the Examiner finds that Scheim teaches compounds
corresponding to (B), namely Scheim formula II and hydrolysates thereof,

Appeal2015-001746
Application 13/130,672
for rapid curing of R TV 1 silicone rubber mixtures. (Id. at 7, 11. 2-14.) The
Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to include compounds
corresponding to Scheim's formula II in the foamable compositions
described by Bauer for the rapid curing. (Id. at 7, 1. 15, to 8, 1. 2.)
Wacker limits its arguments for patentability to claim 11. Wacker
argues initially that Bauer is nonanalogous art because the claimed invention
is concerned with solid silicone elastomers, which is, in Wacker's view, "an
entirely different field of endeavor" than silicone foams. (Br. 13.) A major
problem with this argument is that claim 11 does not recite any properties of
the claimed composition beyond the recitation in the preamble that the
composition is moisture-curable, storage stable in the absence of water, and
cross-linkable by condensation reaction. Moreover, the transitional phrase
"comprising" leaves the composition open to unrecited components
including blowing agents necessary to make foams. The silence of the
supporting Specification does not limit the scope of the claims, and we
decline to read limitations from preferred embodiments into the claims.
Wacker' s arguments that there is insufficient reason to combine the
components described by Fujimoto or Scheim with the compositions of
Bauer are more substantive. In particular, Wacker urges that the
compositions of Fujimoto are not storage stable, as indicated by the
description in the '672 Specification (Spec. 1, 11. 29-38: "[t]he compositions
described therein [i.e., in Fujimoto] using alkoxy-functional silanes are not
stable on storage, however, but instead cure fully within a short time when
the polymer components are mixed with the crosslinkers"), and Comparative
Example 1 (id. at 29: "Samples of the product were stored at 23 ° C
for 24 hours in cartridges with airtight and moisturetight sealing before the
5

Appeal2015-001746
Application 13/130,672
properties were assessed. Further assessment of the product was impossible,
since it had already cured and could no longer be extruded from the
cartridges.") Indeed, as Wacker points out, Bauer teaches that "[t]he
compositions characteristic of RTVl low cure rate is disadvantageous for
the production of foams in general." (Bauer [0004].) Thus, Wacker urges,
the artisan would not have looked to relatively slowly-curing compositions
such as R TV-1 silicone compositions for preparing foamable compositions
such as those taught by Bauer.
Moreover, as Wacker indicates, Bauer teaches that "[ c]ompositions of
this type [i.e., polydiorganosiloxane foams] react without inhibitors even
when they are mixed and are thus not suitable for production of onecomponent, storage stable formulations." (Bauer [0003]; emphasis added.)

Compositions said to contain a blowing agent for the production of silicone
foams are said to have "[t]he disadvantage [] that an elaborate two-chamber
packaging must be used here." (Id.)
Similarly, Wacker urges that "Scheim is directed to R TV-1 caulks and
sealants, which must cure slowly enough that they may be pressed into the
joint and then modeled ('tooled,' 'smoothed') prior to cure." (Br. 24, 11. 911.) Bauer, in contrast, "requires a very fast rate of cure so that his silicone
foam will not collapse." (Id. at 11-12.) Wacker argues further that Bauer
chooses to use an a-silane, N-(trimethoxysilylmethyl)-tetrahydro-1,4oxazine, to increase the rate of cure. (Id. at 25, 11. 10-14, citing Bauer
[0075].) Thus, in Wacker's view, the prior art would have provided no
reason "to add the slower curing compounds (II) of Scheim into Bauer's
formulation." (Br. 25, 11. 24-25.)

6

Appeal2015-001746
Application 13/130,672
The preponderance of the evidence is that Fujimoto teaches
compositions that have been shown to be unsuitable for single component,
storage-stable RTV-1 compositions. The Examiner has not come forward
with evidence or a satisfactory explanation of what teachings would have
suggested that particular components present in Fujimoto's compositions
would have been expected to be useful in the storage stable compositions
described by Bauer.
Similarly, the Examiner has not explained satisfactorily what
teachings would have suggested using slower curing components described
by Scheim in an R TV-1 composition in the fast-curing silicone foam
compositions described by Bauer.
On the present record, the only such suggestions come from
the '672 Specification.
Accordingly, we reverse the rejections on appeal.
