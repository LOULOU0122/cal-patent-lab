OPINION

Lack ofEnablement
Claim 1, the only independent claim and from \vhich all other claims
depend, contains limitations directed to a "porous material" that comprises at
least "one hole" that passes therethrough. Claims App. 1 The claim further
requires that the porosity is such that outside air can be "jetted" to the

1

As last amended prior to appeal, the limitation at issue read: "the upper
and the lower dirt washing units are made of a porous material such that the
outside air can be jetted to the moving space, penetrating the upper and
lower dirt washing units." See Amendment (dated Jan. 11, 2013),
3. That is, the claim did not recite "at least one hole passing therethrough"
in connection with the jetted water limitation. Thus, the Appeal Brief
Claims Appendix does not faithfully present the rejected claim on appeal.
This does not affect our decision, which is based on the claim requirement
for the porosity of the material to be such that outside air can be "jetted" to
the moving space.

Application 12/314,962
moving space, thereby "penetrating the upper and lower dirt washing units."
Id. The Examiner determines that Appellants fail to provide any specific
materials that possess the porous property so claimed. Final Action 2. The
Examiner observes that there are several ways by which a material may be
porous. Id. The Examiner determines that the term "porous" suggests
properties that render a material capable of passing air or liquid. Id. The
Examiner contrasts such property with holes that are formed by an absence
of material. Id. Thus, the Examiner concludes that Appellants' application
lacks adequate disclosure of the claimed "porous" material that would
enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make the claimed invention.
Id.
Appellants traverse the Examiner's rejection by arguing that a porous
material is one through which outside air can be jetted to the moving space.
Appeal Br. 8. Appellants identify cellophane as a porous material. Id.
Appellants refer to three non-applied references for examples of porous
materials. Id. at 8-9. 2 Appellants also provide an on-line dictionary
definition of "porous" as meaning "full of pores and permeable by water, air,
etc." Id. at 9. 3 Appellants express a belief that the claimed "porous"
material is generally well known to someone of ordinary skill. Id.
In response, the Examiner points out, correctly, that cellophane is not
actually disclosed in Appellants' application. Ans. 11. The Examiner rebuts
2

Appellants cite to Yamada (US 4,449,992, iss. May 22, 1984); Usui
(US 6,536,861 Bl, iss. Mar. 25, 2003); and Young (US 6,585,509 B2, iss.
July 1, 2003). None of these references were supplied in Appellants' Appeal
Brief Evidence Appendix and Appellants' Appeal Brief erroneously refers to
each of these issued patent numbers as "patent application" numbers.
Appeal Br. 8-9.

Citing: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/porous?s=t. Id.
5

Appeal2014-009273
Application 12/314,962
Appellants' reliance on non-applied art by pointing out that Appellants'
references are not taken from the cleaning field. Id. The Examiner further
finds, and Appellants do not dispute, that none of Appellants' references
disclose a capability of having air "jetted" through their respective porous
materials. Id. The Examiner states that Appellants' non-applied references
tend to support the fact that porous materials do, in fact, exist, but do not
support that someone of ordinary skill in the pertinent art would be familiar
with porous materials as claimed. Id. at 11-12.
The Examiner emphasizes that the application, as a whole, fails to
disclose any structure that would allow air to be "jetted" through the porous
material. Id. at 12. The Examiner further finds that the Specification fails to
disclose any nozzle or orifice for directing air at and through the porous
material or any jet or orifice formed in the porous material. Id. The
Examiner explains that known porous materials would tend to disperse any
jetted air directed therethrough. Id. at 12-13. The Examiner differentiates
between air that merely seeps through porous material and "jetted air" that is
directed through porous material. Id. at 13 .
The Specification is replete with references to "porous" materials.
See Spec. i-fi-f 13, 17, 22, 41, 50, 60, and original claims 4, 8, and 13.

However, claim 1 is not limited to just any porous material. Rather, claim 1
requires that the dirt washing units draw in jetted air and then direct jetted
air in a vertical direction toward the substrate. Claims App. claim 1.
Furthermore, the "jetting force" of air directed onto the substrate is greater
than the drawing force. Id. Thus, the porous material must be of a character
that the cleaning air stream can be "jetted" onto the substrate to be cleaned
after passing through the porous material.

Application 12/314,962
A patent specification must enable those skilled in the art to make and
use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue experimentation.
35 U.S.C. § 112, i-f 1. Whether a patent claim is enabled is a question of law,
although based upon underlying factual findings. National Recovery

Technologies, Inc., v. Magnetic Separation Systems, Inc. 166 F.3d 1190,
1194 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The enablement requirement ensures that the public
knowledge is enriched by the patent specification to a degree at least
commensurate with the scope of the claims. Id. at 1196. The scope of the
claims must be less than or equal to the scope of the enablement. Id. The
scope of enablement, in tum, is that which is disclosed in the specification
plus the scope of what would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art
without undue experimentation. Id.
It is well-established that a specification need not disclose, and

preferably omits, what is already well known in the art. Streck, Inc. v.

Research & Diagnostic Systems, Inc., 665 F.3d 1269, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
Thus, the disclosure of an application embraces not only what is expressly
set forth in words or drawings, but what would be understood by persons
skilled in the art. See In re Howarth, 654 F.2d 103, 106 (CCPA 1981). A
patent applicant "may begin at the point where his invention begins, and
describe what he has made that is new and what it replaces of the old."

Webster Loom Co. v. Higgins, 105 U.S. 580, 586 (1881). "That which is
common and well known is as if it were written out in the patent and
delineated in the drawings." Id. Nevertheless, "the rule that a specification
need not disclose what is well known in the art is 'merely a rule of
supplementation, not a substitute for a basic enabling disclosure.'" Auto.

Techs. Int'l, Inc. v. BlvnV ofl\!. Am., Inc., 501F.3d1274, 1282 (Fed. Cir.

2007).
The issue presented by Appellants in the instant case is whether
"porous materials" that allow air to be 'jetted" are sufficiently common and
well known as to permit them to form an unwritten part of the disclosure of
the application. Here, Appellants represent that cellophane is an example of
a porous material. Appeal Br. 8. However, Appellants provide no evidence
that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have known that cellophane
could be used in the invention. Appellants' reliance on Yamada, U sui, and
Young is also misplaced as there is no evidence that the porous materials
disclosed therein are capable of supplying "jetted" air in a washing device.
Moreover, there is no evidence that persons of ordinary skill in the art would
have been able to extract a teaching from Yamada, U sui, and Young that
would have enabled them to select an appropriate porous material so that air
could be jetted onto a substrate in a washing device. Finally, Appellants'
reliance on a dictionary definition of "porous" is of no avail as it fails to
differentiate between porous materials that would be operable and those that
would be inoperable in the claimed invention. 4

Neither Appellants nor the Examiner provided an undue experimentation
analysis under the Wands factors per se. See In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731,
737 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (listing factors for determining whether a disclosure
satisfies the enablement requirement). Nevertheless, it is evident that the
Examiner's analysis is based on the factors most relevant to this case, that is,
the lack of "direction or guidance presented" by the inventor, and the
"absence of working examples" sufficient to provide an enabling disclosure
of the claimed porous material. Id. at 737. In a case such as this, it is not
necessary to specifically cite to Wands. See In re Hillis, 484 Fed. Appx. 491
(Fed. Cir. 2012); MPEP § 2164.0l(a).

Appeal2014-009273
Application 12/314,962
In view of the foregoing discussion, we determine the Examiner's
findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and the
Examiner's legal conclusion of lack of enablement is well-founded.
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's section 112 non-enablement
rejection of claims 1-3, 7, 8, and 15.
Indefiniteness

We do not reach the section 112, second paragraph, indefiniteness
rejection because our affirmance of the section 112, first paragraph,
non-enablement rejection set forth above disposes of all claims on appeal.
37 C.F.R. § 41.50(a)(l).
Unpatentability of Claims 1-3, 7, 8, and 15
over the Prior Art

We do not reach the obviousness rejections because our affirmance of
the non-enablement rejection disposes of all claims on appeal. 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.50(a)(l). We do not believe it necessary to address the obviousness of
claims containing subject matter for which an enabling disclosure is not
provided in the specification, as filed. See Ex Parte Smith, 2008 WL
4998624 (BPAI 2008). 5
DECISION
The decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1-3, 7, 8, and 15 is
affirmed.

5

We note that the section of Appellants' Brief devoted to the obviousness
rejection refers to prior art that is different from the prior art relied on by the
Examiner in the rejection. See Appeal Br. 10, final paragraph. Thus,
Appellants' arguments do not appear to be responsive to the Examiner's
rejection.
