DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEi1~RI1'JG
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellant filed a Request for Rehearing ("Req. Reh' g.") dated August
23, 2016, under 37 C.F.R. § 41.52, regarding the Decision on Appeal mailed
July 21, 2016 ("Decision"). As stated in this Decision, a New Ground of
Rejection was entered as to all of claims 1-7 and 24 due to a lack of support
for a negative limitation in sole independent claim 1. See Req. Reh' g. 2.
We withdraw that portion of our Decision entering the New Ground
of Rejection. The remainder of our Decision addressing the Examiner's
rejections under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102(b) and 103(a) is unaffected.

Appeal2014-006606
Application 12/861,974
THE REQUEST FOR REHEARING
A request for rehearing "must state with particularity the points
believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked by the [Patent Trial
and Appeal Board ("Board")]." See 37 C.F.R. § 41.52(a)(l ). This section
also states that arguments not raised in the briefs before the Board and
evidence not previously relied upon in the briefs "are not permitted in the
request for rehearing except as permitted by paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4)
of this section." Also, a request for rehearing is not an opportunity to merely
express disagreement with a decision without setting forth points believed to
have been misapprehended or overlooked. The proper course for an
appellant dissatisfied with a Board decision is to seek judicial review, not to
file a request for rehearing to reargue issues that have already been decided.
See 35 U.S.C. §§ 141, 145.

BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS
Sole independent claim 1 is reproduced below.
1. A method for anticoagulating blood, comprising:
drawing whole blood from a blood source at a draw flow
rate; and
adding anticoagulant to the whole blood at an
anticoagulant flow rate that is independent of the draw flow
rate.
Appellant does not dispute our discussion in the Decision where it is
stated:
Accordingly, we understand Appellant's usage of the claim
term "independent" to mean not dependent, thus seeking to
distinguish Appellant's system from prior systems. Appellant's
usage of this claim term in such a manner is a negative claim
limitation.
Decision 3.

Application 12/861,974
Thereafter, was a discussion of the 2012 case of Santarus, Inc. v. Par
Pharm., Inc., 694 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Decision 3. In Santarus, our
reviewing court stated: "Negative claim limitations are adequately supported
when the specification describes a reason to exclude the relevant limitation."
Id. at 13 51; see also Decision 3. It is our reliance on that case which is the
basis for Appellant's Request for Rehearing because Appellant contends that
the Decision:
erroneously applies an unduly strict standard of disclosure that
is inconsistent with current Federal Circuit authority and,
accordingly, is erroneous and reaches an erroneous conclusion.
Req. Reh' g. 2. Instead, Appellant states:
The 'reason to exclude' standard of Santarus is discussed by
the Federal Circuit in Inphi Corp. v. Netlist, Inc., 805 F.3d 1350
(Fed. Cir. 2015), which emphasizes that there is no heightened
disclosure standard for negative claim limitations.
Req. Reh'g. 5.
Inphi discusses negative claim limitations and states:
Whether a patent claim satisfies the written description
requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 1 depends on
whether the description "clearly allow[ s] persons of ordinary
skill in the art to recognize that [the inventor] invented what is
claimed.
Inphi, 805 F.3d at 1355, referencing Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d
1555, 1562-63 (Fed.Cir.1991); see also Req. Reh'g 5. The Inphi Court
further stated:
The question that remains is whether properly describing
alternative features-without articulating advantages or
disadvantages of each feature---can constitute a 'reason to
exclude' under the standard articulated in Santarus. We hold
that it can.
Inphi, 805 F.3d at 1355; see also Req. Reh'g. 6.

Appeal2014-006606
Application 12/861,97 4
In short, Appellant states (and we agree):
Inphi notes that Santarus found express recitation of
(dis )advantages to be sufficient to provide a reason to exclude
the claim limitation at issue, but specifically states that
Santarus does not require the specification to include such
recitations to provide adequate support for a negative limitation.
Id. at 1356. 1

Req. Reh'g. 5.
The Inphi court clarified the requisite support necessary for a negative
claim limitation stating:
When viewed in its proper context, Santarus simply reflects the
fact that the specification need only satisfy the requirements of
§ 112, paragraph 1 as described in this court's existing
jurisprudence, including through compliance with MPEP
§ 2173.05(i) ("If alternative elements are positively recited in
the specification, they may be explicitly excluded in the
claims.") and In re Johnson, 558 F.2d at 1018 ("It is for the
inventor to decide what bounds of protection he will seek.").
Inphi, 805 F.3d at 1356.

Based on the above, Appellant contends, "the specification of the
present application clearly allows one of ordinary skill in the art to recognize
that the inventor invented the claimed subject matter." Req. Reh'g. 6. The
Board, via its Decision, did not assert that one skilled in the art would not
have recognized or understood that which was claimed. Instead, the
Decision focused on Appellant's Specification and whether a sufficient

1

"The Santarus court found that the patent-at-issue's express recitation of
(dis)advantages was sufficient to provide a reason to exclude the clahn
limitation at issue. That court did not hold however, that such recitations
were required to satisfy the written description requirements of§ 112,
paragraph 1 for negative claim limitations. Nor do we see any reason to now
articulate a new and heightened standard for negative claim limitations."
Jnphi, 805 F.3d at 1356.

Appeal2014-006606
Application 12/861,974
"reason to exclude" was expressed as per the teachings of Santarus. See
Decision 3. The Board found no such reason and hence concluded that
Appellant's Specification fails to adequately support the above negative
claim limitation "because Appellant's Specification fails to 'describe[] a
reason to exclude the relevant limitation."' Decision 4, referencing
Santarus, 694 F.3d at 1351. In Inphi, however, we are instructed by our
reviewing Court to instead ascertain "whether the description 'clearly
allow[s] persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [the inventor]
invented what is claimed."' Inphi, 805 F.3d at 1355 citing Vas-Cath, 935
F.2d at 1562---63.
Additionally, Appellant contends that Appellant's Specification
"describe[ s] alternative features of the inventive approach that differ from
features of the conventional approach." Req. Reh'g. 7. Appellant notes that
the Decision addressed paragraphs 24, 25, and 31 of Appellant's
Specification where alternative features and advantages of the invention
were discussed. Req. Reh'g. 7; see also Decision 3--4. Nevertheless, the
Board was not swayed that these paragraphs met the threshold of a "reason
to exclude" as per Santarus, and hence the Board entered a New Ground of
Rejection. Now, however, Appellant correctly points out that, in view of the
more recent Inphi decision, the threshold applied in the Decision was not the
proper threshold to apply when ascertaining a reason to exclude.
Accordingly, Appellant is persuasive that the Board erred in rendering
the New Ground of Rejection as expressed in the Decision. We agree with
Appellant "that there is adequate support for the limitation of claim 1 under
the Inphi I Vas-Cath standard." Req. Reh' g. 8. In summation, the New
Ground of Rejection stated in the Decision is withdrawn. However, such

5

Application 12/861,974
withdrawal does not affect the remainder of the Decision directed to the
Examiner's prior art rejections.
DECISION
Appellant's Request for Rehearing has been granted. We have
reconsidered our Decision in light of the arguments in Appellant's Request
for Rehearing. We make the above noted modifications to our Decision.
