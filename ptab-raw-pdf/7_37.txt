DECISION ON APPEAL
The Applicants (hereinafter the "Appellants") 1 appeal under 35 U.S.C.
ยง 134(a) from a final decision of the Primary Examiner to reject claims 1-10

and 21. 2 We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. ยง 6(b).

The Appellants state that the real parties in interest are "3M Company ...
and its affiliate 3M Innovative Properties Company" (Appeal Brief filed
December 12, 2013, hereinafter "Br.," 2).

Br. 2; Final Office Action delivered electronically on June 3, 2013,
hereinafter "Final Act.," 3-9. On page 1 of the Final Office Action
("Disposition of Claims"), the Examiner indicated that claims 15, 18, 22,
and 23 were finally rejected. These claims, however, were withdrawn from
consideration pursuant to a restriction requirement (Final Act. 2).

We reverse.

BACKGROUND
The subject matter on appeal relates to a display device including-in
order of arrangement-a first substrate, a first electrode, a light-emitting
display material, a second electrode, and a second substrate (Specification,
hereinafter "Spec.," 10, 11. 19-27; Fig. 8). Claim 1, the only independent
claim on appeal, is reproduced below from page 7 of the Appeal Brief
(Claims Appendix), with key limitations indicated in italics, as follows:
1.
A display device, comprising layers arranged in
the following order:
a first substrate;
a first electrode;
a display material, wherein the display material
comprises an OLED material;
a second electrode; and
a second substrate,
wherein at least one of the first and second electrodes
comprises:
a first transparent or semitransparent conductive
layer;
a second transparent or semitransparent conductive
layer; and
a transparent or semitransparent intervening layer
located between the first and second conductive layers,
wherein the intervening layer comprises a dielectric,
wherein the intervening layer includes electrically
conductive transparent or semitransparent pathways
extending through the intervening layer between and in
contact with the first and second conductive layers,
wherein the first and second conductive layers
each comprise a sheet of material and the first conductive
layer is substantially coextensive with the second
conductive layer.

THE REJECTION
Claims 1-10 and 21 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as
unpatentable over Bright3 in view of Song et al. (hereinafter "Song") 4
(Examiner's Answer delivered electronically on July 18, 2014, hereinafter
"Ans.," 2-12; Final Act. 3-9).

DISCUSSION
The Examiner found (Final Act. 3-5) that Bright describes a display
device as specified in claim 1 except:
Bright does not expressly disclose [that] the intervening
layer (bottom layer 24, Fig. 9) includes electrically conductive
pathways extending through the intervening layer between and
in contact with the first and second conductive layers (lower
layer 22 and middle layer 22, Fig. 9).[ 5J
(Final Act. 5). In an attempt to resolve this difference, the Examiner relied
on Song. Specifically, the Examiner found that "Song teaches ... the use of
transparent and/or semitransparent [0034] multilayered electrodes for use in
flexible displays that have conductive pathways, 30, [0029] [0083] to allow
stacking of layers ... to form flexible multilayer electrodes with better
transparency" (id.). Based on these findings, the Examiner concluded that
"it would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art ... to
modify [Bright's] invention with electrically conductive pathways, of the
same material as the electrodes, extending through the intervening layer

[ J The Examiner states that Bright does not "expressly disclose" (emphasis
added) the identified claim limitations, leaving open the possibility that
Bright may inherently disclose these limitations. The Examiner, however,
has not discussed inherent disclosure and, therefore, we do not address it.

between and in contact with the first and second conductive layers to form a
better, more transparent, multilayer electrode for use in flexible
displays .... " (id. at 6).
The Appellants contend that Bright would have taught away from
including Song's nano-metal layer within protective polymer layer 24 (as
shown in Bright's Figure 9) because Bright's layer 24 is described as
enhancing barrier properties by reducing the number of holes and defects in
the films upon which or under which they are deposited (Br. 4). The
Appellants point out that, by contrast, such defects in the claimed invention
would be desirable in that they could result in the electrically conductive
pathways specified in claim 1 (id.). The Appellants also argue that Song's
teachings are directed to improving the electrical conductivity of an
electroconductive polymer layer 40 (as shown in Figure 1}-not a layer such
as an intervening protective polymer layer 24 as disclosed in Bright-and,
therefore, if Bright and Song were to be combined, a person of ordinary skill
in the art would have included Song's nano-metal layer into Bright's
electroconductive layers (i.e., layers 22 shown in Figure 9) rather than
intervening protective polymer layers 24 (Br. 4).
We agree with the Appellants that the Examiner failed to articulate a
sufficient reason with some rational underpinning to support the conclusion
that a person having ordinary skill in the art would have combined the
references in the manner claimed by the Appellants. In re Kahn, 441 F.3d
977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006), cited with approval in KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex
Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007).

Song teaches that a nano-metal layer 30 positioned between grid
electrode 20 and an electroconductive polymer layer 40 can improve the

4

Appeal2015-000228
Application 12/540,394
electroconductivity of a transparent electrode by capturing charges (ii 34;
Fig. 1). Thus, as pointed out by the Appellants (Br. 4), "[t]he nanometal
layer 30 of Song is not used to form electrical connections between
conductive layers" as in the Appellants' claimed invention. Also, as pointed
out by the Appellants, Bright's intervening protective polymer layer 24,
which the Examiner found to comprise dielectric material (Final Act. 4), is
described as "enhanc[ing] barrier properties by reducing the number of holes
and defects in the films upon which or under which, they are deposited"
(Bright i-f 67). But nothing in the relied-upon evidence indicates that
Bright's layer 24 itself may be electroconductive or that a need exists to
make it electroconductive. Therefore, we find the Examiner's factual basis
for supporting the articulated reason for combining the references to be
insufficient.
In response to the Appellants' teaching away argument (i.e., that
providing Song's nano-metal in Bright's intervening protective polymer
layer 24 would be inconsistent with Bright's disclosed purpose for layer 24),
the Examiner stated that "[t]he disclosure of desirable alternatives does not
necessarily negate a suggestion for modifying the prior to arrive at the
claimed invention" (Ans. 10) (internal citation omitted). The problem,
however, is that the Examiner failed-in the first instance-to direct us to
evidence or reasoning demonstrating that a person having ordinary skill in
the art would have understood Bright's less desirable alternatives to include
enhancing layer 24's electroconductivity. At most, a person having ordinary
skill in the art may have modified Bright's electroconductive layers 22 to
include Song's nano-metal materials to enhance electroconductivity, but, as
argued by the Appellants, such a modification would not result in the

5

Appeal2015-000228
Application 12/540,394
invention recited in claim 1, which requires the intervening layers to include
electroconductive pathways that extend therethrough.
For these reasons, and those set forth in the Appeal Brief, we cannot
uphold the Examiner's rejection.
SUMMARY
The Examiner's final decision to reject claims 1-10 and 21 is
reversed.
REVERSED
