Appeal2014-005871
Application 11/747,881
Appellants have presented several arguments as to why the
combination of the references does not teach or suggest the features recited
in the rejected claims. 2
Further, we have reviewed the Examiner's response to Appellants'
arguments. The Examiner has provided a comprehensive response to each
argument presented by the Appellants on pages 14 through 20 of the
Answer. We have reviewed this response and concur with the Examiner's
findings and conclusions. We adopt as our own (1) the findings and reasons
set forth by the Examiner in the action from which this appeal is taken and
(2) the reasons set forth by the Examiner in the Examiner's Final Action and
Answer in response to Appellants' Appeal Brief. Final Act. 2-15; Ans. 14-20. We observe that no Reply Brief is of record to rebut such findings
including the Examiner's responses to Appellants' arguments.

DECISION
The decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1-7, 9, 12, 16, 17, 19,
20, 22, and 27-29 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
