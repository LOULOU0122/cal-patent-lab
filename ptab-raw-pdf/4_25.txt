Appeal2015-003070
Application 12/849,026
INVENTION
The invention is directed to a system for automatic context passing
during management application navigation. See Abstract.
Claim 1 is illustrative of the invention and reproduced below:
An article of manufacture including a nontransitory computer readable storage medium to tangibly store
instructions, which when executed by a computer, cause the
computer to:
1.

receive a user action to navigate to a second management
application from a first management application;
collect one or more managed entities in the first
management application, wherein the one or more managed
entities are at least one of an application and a service;
define one or more related entities, comprising entities
related to the one or more managed entities to populate a
managed entity context, wherein the one or more related entities
are defined through entity relations registered by one or more
dedicated managed beans (MBeans ), the one or more dedicated
r\1Beans comprising an attribute sho\~1ing the entity relations;
retrieve one or more context entities from the managed
entity context, the one or more context entities recognizable by
the second management application; and
apply the retrieved one or more context entities in the
second management application.
REJECTION AT ISSUE
The Examiner rejected claims 1 through 3, 5 through 9, and 11
through 20 under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as unpatentable over O'Conor (US
7,457,807 B2; Nov. 25, 2008), Corneille et al. (US 2005/0075115 Al; Apr.

Application 12/849,026
7, 2005) and Pombo et al. (US 2011/0153465; June 23, 2011). Final Act. 4-

10.1
ANALYSIS
Independent claims 1, 7, and 13 recite a limitation directed to defining
one or more related entities, related to management entities where the related
entities defined through entity relations registered by one or more dedicated
managed beans (MBeans), where the MBeans comprise an attribute showing
the entity relations. Appellants argue that neither O'Conor, Corneille, nor
Pombo teach MBeans showing the attribute relations for the related entities
as claimed. App. Br 7-8; Reply Br. 2-3. The Examiner responds finding
that O'Conner teaches related entities and that Pombo teaches use of
MBeans. Answer 4-5.
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejection and response to
Appellants' arguments and do not consider the Examiner to have presented
sufficient evidence and provided sufficient explanation to show that
O'Conner, Corneille, and Pombo, combined, teach using MBeans showing
the attribute relations for the related entities as claimed. Thus, we concur
with Appellants and do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of independent
claims 1, 7, and 13, and dependent claims 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14
through 20.
