DECISION ON APPEAL

Appellants 1 appeal under 35 U.S.C. ยง 134 from the Examiner's
rejection under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) of claims 1-10 as unpatentable over at
least the basic combination of Dirschl et al. (US 2004/0249165 A 1,
published Dec. 9, 2004) ("Dirschl"), Greenwood et al. (US 4,742, 140, issued
May 3, 1988) ("Greenwood"), and Ishikawa et al. (US 6,211,284 Bl, issued
Apr. 3, 2001) ("Ishikawa"). 2 We have jurisdiction over the appeal under

1

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is Huntsman Textiles
Effects (Germany) GmbH LLC (Br. 3).
2
While the Examiner applies additional references to claims 7-9 (Ans. 8, 9),
Appellants rely upon their arguments with respect to claim 1 for all the
claims on appeal (Br. 11-18).

Appeal2015-005600
Application 12/677,721
35 U.S.C. ยง 6(b).
We affirm.
Upon consideration of the evidence of record and each of Appellants'
contentions as set forth in the Appeal Brief filed Nov. 7, 2014, we determine
that Appellants have not demonstrated reversible error in the Examiner's
rejection (e.g., Ans. 2-7 (mailed March 3, 2015)). We sustain the rejection
for the reasons expressed by the Examiner in the Final Office Action and the
Answer. We add the following for emphasis.
Appellants argue the claims as a group. Accordingly, all of the claims
stand or fall with claim 1 (see Br. 11-18 (see also Claims App.)).
Appellants do not dispute the Examiner's findings with respect to
Dirschl and Greenwood and Ishikawa; rather, they allege that Ishikawa
teaches away from the use of its polyoxyalkylene-functional
diorganopolysiloxane (which corresponds to component B of Appellants'
claim 1) because Ishika\'l/a teaches that it needs to be used in conjunction

with another polyoxyalkylene-functional diiorganosiloxane containing an
amino-functional group (see generally Br. 13, 14). This argument is not
persuasive. As the Examiner points out, neither the claims nor Dirschl
preclude the use of other siloxanes (Ans. 7).
Appellants then state that "[a]ssuming arguendo that appellant's
composition of claim 1 is rendered obvious," the Specification examples
evince unexpected results (Br. 15). It is well established that the burden of
showing unexpected results rests on the person who asserts them by
establishing that the difference between the claimed invention and the
closest prior art was an unexpected difference. See In re Klosak, 455 F .2d
1077, 1080 (CCP A 1972). Further, the showing of unexpected results must

Application 12/677,721
be commensurate in scope with the claims. See In re Peterson, 315 F .3d
1325, 1330-31 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Appellants have not shown reversible error
in the Examiner's findings that the evidence relied upon by Appellants (two
inventive examples as set forth in the Specification) is not compared to the
closest prior art (Dirschl), and is not commensurate in scope with the breadth
of claim 1 and, therefore, is not persuasive evidence of nonobviousness
(Ans. 8).
The decision of the Examiner is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. ยง 1.136(a).
