DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

1

Issued to André Sloth Eriksen on August 21, 2012 (hereinafter the ’764
patent).

Appeal 2015-007934
Reexamination Control 95/002,386
Patent US 8,245,764 B2
The Requester filed REQUESTER’S REQUEST FOR REHEARING
on May 31, 2016 (hereinafter “Rehearing Request” or “Reh’g. Req.”).”)
under 37 C.F.R. § 41.79 seeking rehearing of our Decision mailed April 29,
2016 (hereinafter “Decision” or “Dec.”), which reversed various final
rejections of the claims made by the Examiner. The Patent Owner submitted
its Opposition to Request for Rehearing (hereinafter “Opposition” or
“Opp.”) on June 28, 2016. We grant the Rehearing Request to the extent
that we consider the Requester’s arguments, but DENY the request to
modify the Decision.
The Requester’s first argument is that the Board overlooked evidence
in this appeal by not considering the expert testimony of Dr. Carman.
Reh’g. Req. 3. The Requester asserts that Dr. Carman’s testimony was of
record via the required submissions of concurrent proceedings, which
occurred after the issues in this reexamination were briefed. Reh’g. Req. 1.
As the Patent Owner correctly notes, however, “notices of concurrent
proceedings are to be made without comment or discussion of the issues.”
Opp. 2. Furthermore, as the Patent Owner also points out, the Requester
attempts to rely on Dr. Carman’s testimony because “it failed to properly
submit its declaration of Seri Lee,” a declaration that “purported to stand for
the identical proposition as the Carman declaration.” Id. Furthermore, the
Lee declaration issue notwithstanding, the Requester has provided no
explanation why it could not or did not submit a timely declaration during
the reexamination proceedings, which the Patent Owner did. We did not
overlook the testimony of Dr. Carman, but properly excluded it from

consideration, except to the extent that we heard oral argument regarding its
content, as not properly being timely filed and before us for consideration.
The Requester also asserts that the Board misapprehended aspects of
Koga suggesting that it should have properly been considered a thermal
exchange chamber as claimed. Reh’g. Req. 3–7. Much of this argument
relies on Dr. Carman’s testimony, but even considering Dr. Carman’s
testimony would not change our Decision. What the Requester apparently
fails to accept is that the mere fact of thermal exchange does not turn a
chamber into a thermal exchange chamber as claimed. We have already
considered at length the Requester’s position that the “sucking channel” be
considered a thermal exchange chamber and have rejected it. Even without
declaration evidence submitted by either side, we would reject this
argument. As the Patent Owner points out “[t]he Board devoted nearly four
pages of its eight-page opinion to findings of fact and analysis of [Koga’s]
‘sucking channel.’” Opp. 5 (citing Dec. 4–7).
Although we have already explained this in detail, Koga’s sucking
channel, by its very name, is merely a conduit to carry fluid from one place
to another. The fact that it may be made of material or have other properties
that cause some amount of thermal exchange is irrelevant given our
construction. As presented by the Patent Owner, we also agree with Judge
Tigar’s assessment of the Requester’s argument “that to afford the claim
term ‘thermal exchange chamber’ the breadth required to read on Koga’s
‘sucking channel” . . . would result in an unreasonable construction – i.e., it
would ‘defy common sense.’” Opp. 8 (citing the Notice of Concurrent
Proceedings pp. 17–18).

DECISION
While we have considered the Decision in light of the Rehearing
Request, we decline to modify it in any respect.
Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 41.79(d), this decision is final for the purpose
of judicial review. A party seeking judicial review must timely serve notice
on the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. See
37 C.F.R. §§ 90.1 and 1.983.

DENIED
