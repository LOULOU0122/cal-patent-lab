# cal-patent-lab: Predicting Bad Patents

This folder contains the "brains" of our project, organized as follows:

* **notebooks**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks allowing us to instantly run test versions of Python scripts and generate statistics
* **parsers**: Draft versions of the crawlers and extractors using to retrieve data from the USPTO and eFOIA websites
* **utils**: Consolidated files containing parsing and extracting code, in a format which other developers can easily import

All necessary libraries for running these scripts are located in the file `requirements.txt`.
