A computer worm detection system orchestrates a sequence of network activities in a computer network and monitors the computer network to identify an anomalous behavior of the computer network. The computer worm detection system then determines whether the anomalous behavior is caused by the computer worm and can determine an identifier for detecting the computer worm based on the anomalous behavior. The computer worm detection system can also generate a recovery script for disabling the computer worm or repairing damage caused by the computer worm.
