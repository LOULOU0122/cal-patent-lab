 An electrode assembly for sensing an electrochemical signal diffused from a source to a working electrode which is comprised of a plurality of substantially separated working electrode surfaces is disclosed. The electrode of the invention is comprised of 1) a working electrode made up of a plurality of working electrode surfaces or components and 2) a electrically insulating gap defined by adjacent edges of 1) insulating the working electrode surfaces or components from each other. The working electrode components are configured to receive electrochemical signal from two or preferably three dimensions simultaneously. The working electrode components configured over the same surface as a single electrode provide (1) an improved signal to noise ratio as compared to a single electrode by reducing noise, and (2) provide an overall enhanced signal after sensing for a given period of time.
