 Disclosed is a device for producing a safe and effective infant walking trainer and carrier garment to assist the parents with the training and care of their children. Too many articles in the care and handling of infants have been found to be a danger to the infant and in some cases have caused fatalities of infants even with very attentive parents. When we purchase an article designed for children we assume it is safe, but it has been proven that many are not. Safety in the design of devices in the field of childcare must be of the utmost importance.
