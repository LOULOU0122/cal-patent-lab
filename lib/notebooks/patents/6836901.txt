 Multi-use strips can be applied to a variety of articles to absorb perspiration and protect wearable articles. The strips generally comprise a liquid permeable outer sheet, an absorbent medium, and a backsheet. Applied to the backsheet can be a fastening adhesive. A peel sheet can be attached to the backsheet that can be removed immediately prior to attaching the strip on a article. Other embodiments include attaching multi-use strip to a Velcro strip. In addition, embodiments include the distribution of a roll of material that can be cut to a desired length or provided in pre-cut stacks of the absorbent strips.
