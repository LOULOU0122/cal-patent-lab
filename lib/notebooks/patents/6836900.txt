 The bib of the present invention has a collar and a chest-covering fabric extending from and attached to the collar. The collar is a resilient, generally C-shaped, flat plastic ring that is disposed within a sleeve. The fabric is attached to the lower end of the sleeve and it covers a user's chest to protect the user's clothes from food stains and spills. Consequently, the bib covers the user's chest while being retained about the neck by the resilient collar, eliminating the need for reaching behind the neck to fasten and unfasten the bib. The bib is suitable for user's of any age, and is particularly well adapted for use by the elderly, the disabled, and small toddlers. The chest cover may have any desired shape or color, and may have indicia thereon.
