      " An arrangement for determining the heart rate (f RR ) or the refractory time of the cardiac tissue, particularly for detecting tachycardia or fibrillation, has an electrode (E) for sensing heart action signals (SIG), an input stage, connected to the electrode, for processing the heart action signals, a refractory member for ascertaining a refractory time value of the arrangement, in each case after a predetermined segment of a heart action signal, and a processing device, connected to the output of the input stage or of the refractory member, for determining the rate of the heart action signals, processed with blanking of the component that occurs during the refractory time, or for determining the refractory time value of the cardiac tissue. The arrangement further includes a device which is connected at least indirectly to the output of the processing device or of the input stage for automatically adjusting the refractory time of the refractory member as a function of a previously determined value of the heart rate or of a signal parameter of a previously determined heart action signal.  \n",
      " An electrode assembly for sensing an electrochemical signal diffused from a source to a working electrode which is comprised of a plurality of substantially separated working electrode surfaces is disclosed. The electrode of the invention is comprised of 1) a working electrode made up of a plurality of working electrode surfaces or components and 2) a electrically insulating gap defined by adjacent edges of 1) insulating the working electrode surfaces or components from each other. The working electrode components are configured to receive electrochemical signal from two or preferably three dimensions simultaneously. The working electrode components configured over the same surface as a single electrode provide (1) an improved signal to noise ratio as compared to a single electrode by reducing noise, and (2) provide an overall enhanced signal after sensing for a given period of time.  \n",
      " A edge emitting waveguide laser is obtained that derives its optical power from a vertical cavity laser structure. The vertical cavity laser with top and bottom Distributed Bragg Reflectors produces stimulated emission by resonance in the vertical direction but the optical power so generated is diffracted by a second order grating into an optical mode propagating in the optical waveguide formed by the upper and lower mirrors as cladding layers. The efficiency of the diffraction grating and the reflectivity of the mirrors are maximized so that essentially all of the light is coupled into the guide and the loss through the mirrors can be neglected. The same structure can be utilized as a detector, a modulator or an amplifier. The designated laser structure to achieve this form of operation is the inversion channel laser which is a laterally injected laser having both contacts on the top side of the device. Then the anode and cathode of the laser are essentially coplanar electrodes and the device is implemented in the form of a traveling wave laser, detector, modulator or amplifier which forms the basis for very high frequency performance.  \n",
      " A method for producing dialkylsilyl bis (2-alkyl-4-aryl indenyl) titanocenes including rac-Me 2 Si bis (2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)-titanium dichloride is described.  \n",
      " Instrumentation for osteofixation including a locking bone plate and a surgical drill guide. The plate has a plurality of fastener holes with inner walls of a preselected hole diameter. The drill guide has a guide member, for guiding a drill bit, and a hollow collet disposed substantially coaxially with the guide member. A radially expandable forward end of the collet comprises a radially expandable neck and an outwardly projecting rim disposed forward of the neck. This rim defines a contracted outer rim diameter that is smaller than the hole diameter in a contracted collet position, and an expanded outer rim diameter that is larger than the hole diameter in an expanded position. Thus, the rim is freely extractable through the plate hole in the contracted position, but is unreceivable through the plate hole in the expanded position. The collet neck is configured and dimensioned to press outwardly against an inner wall of the plate hole when the neck is expanded.  \n",
      " A napkin holder formed of two pairs of magnetic securing devices attached in a laterally movable arrangement with respect to each other on the outer ends of a partially neck encircling lanyard. The magnetic securing devices are formed of plastic tabs movable laterally with respect to each other, one tab having an embedded magnet and the other having a magnetizable slug embedded in it. The napkin holder may be supplied with at least one napkin to be used with it in a package designed to provide an immediately usable combination product.  \n",
      " The bib of the present invention has a collar and a chest-covering fabric extending from and attached to the collar. The collar is a resilient, generally C-shaped, flat plastic ring that is disposed within a sleeve. The fabric is attached to the lower end of the sleeve and it covers a user's chest to protect the user's clothes from food stains and spills. Consequently, the bib covers the user's chest while being retained about the neck by the resilient collar, eliminating the need for reaching behind the neck to fasten and unfasten the bib. The bib is suitable for user's of any age, and is particularly well adapted for use by the elderly, the disabled, and small toddlers. The chest cover may have any desired shape or color, and may have indicia thereon.  \n",
      " Multi-use strips can be applied to a variety of articles to absorb perspiration and protect wearable articles. The strips generally comprise a liquid permeable outer sheet, an absorbent medium, and a backsheet. Applied to the backsheet can be a fastening adhesive. A peel sheet can be attached to the backsheet that can be removed immediately prior to attaching the strip on a article. Other embodiments include attaching multi-use strip to a Velcro strip. In addition, embodiments include the distribution of a roll of material that can be cut to a desired length or provided in pre-cut stacks of the absorbent strips.  \n",
      " Disclosed is a device for producing a safe and effective infant walking trainer and carrier garment to assist the parents with the training and care of their children. Too many articles in the care and handling of infants have been found to be a danger to the infant and in some cases have caused fatalities of infants even with very attentive parents. When we purchase an article designed for children we assume it is safe, but it has been proven that many are not. Safety in the design of devices in the field of childcare must be of the utmost importance.  \n",
      " A uniquely woven braid is fashioned on the outer surfaces of various garments, such as shirts, jeans, skirts or dresses. The braided surfaces provide a function, since they allow the garment to be form fitting and stretchably conform to the size and shape of the wearer. The braid also results in an attractive and decorative clothing design. The braid is accomplished easily and simply by cutting a plurality of slits in the outer surfaces of the garment and threading the adjacent resulting loop segments which ultimately form the braid.  \n"
