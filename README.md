_Keeping track of requirements:_

* Every time you add a requirement to a python script (e.g., `import numpy as np`), make sure you add that requirement to the requirements file in `lib/requirements.txt`
* Run the requirements files to get all the latest dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
