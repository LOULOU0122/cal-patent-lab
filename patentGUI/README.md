This is a Django web application that interfaces with our machine learning model.

To run this application, use the command `python manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>`. If you choose not to specify the IP address or the port number, it will default to `127.0.0.1:8000`.

You may need to run `pip install requirements.txt` beforehand if you do not already have the prerequisite dependencies.
