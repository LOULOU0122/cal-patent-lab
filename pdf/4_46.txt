DECISION ON APPEAL

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This is a decision on appeal, under 35 U.S.C. ยง 134(a), from a final
rejection of claims 1, 2, and 4--14. App. Br. 8. Claim 3 has been canceled.
App. Br. 27, Claims App. Claims 15--47 have been withdrawn from
consideration. App. Br. 29-33, Claims App. We have jurisdiction under 35
U.S.C. ยง 6(b).
We REVERSE.

THE CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The disclosed subject matter "relates to methods and systems for
protecting areas or regions from destructive dynamic vortex atmospheric
structures (DVAS) such as tomados, cyclones, and the like." Spec. i-f 1.
Independent claim 1, the sole independent claim, is representative of the
claims on appeal and is reproduced below:
A method for destabilizing a dynamic atmospheric vortex
structure, the method comprising:
providing a cluster of spatially oriented discrete
mechanical elements at a location relative to the vortex structure
to thereby produce an area of local active anisotropy, which
creates a non-stationary, turbulent field with significant
anisotropy that destabilizes the vortex structure, wherein the
vortex structure is a tornado.

THE REJECTION ON APPEAL
Claims 1, 2, and 4--14 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Graf and Banks.

ANALYSIS
Independent claim 1 recites a method for destabilizing a dynamic
atmospheric vortex structure "wherein the vortex structure is a tomado." 1
The Examiner primarily relies on Graf for disclosing the limitations of claim
1

Appellants' Specification provides further guidance stating that vortex
structures of the type recited include "tomados, cyclones, and the like."
Spec. i-f 1; see also f 53.

1 but finds that "Graf does not teach wherein the vortex structure is a
tornado." Final Act. 3. The Examiner relies on Banks for teaching "a
method for destabilizing a dynamic atmospheric vortex structure, wherein
the vortex structure is a tornado (col. 4, lines 60-65)." Final Act. 3. To be
clear, Banks is concerned with "heavy winds, especially those experienced
with severe weather including tornado and twisters of the Midwest." Banks
4:60-62. Nevertheless, despite the above recitation in claim 1 as to what
constitutes a vortex structure (i.e., a tornado), the Examiner states, "applicant
has not defined what constitutes a dynamic atmospheric vortex structure, and
under the broadest reasonable interpretation of the term, the wind flow paths
of Graf meet the term." 2 Final Act. 3. The Examiner concludes that it
would have been obvious to incorporate the teachings of Banks into the
method of Graf "since it is known in the art to destabilize dynamic
atmospheric vortexes, including tornados, as taught by Banks." Final Act. 3.
Appellants dispute the Examiner's interpretation of the teachings of
Graf and Banks in regard to destabilizing a tornado. See App. Br. 9-11;
Reply Br. 4--5. More particularly, Appellants assert: "It is respectfully
submitted that upon closer review, it will be understood that Banks does not
teach a method for destabilizing a tornado. Instead, Banks describes
redirecting wind flows which may originate from a tornado." Appeal Br. 9

Figure 2a of Graf is relied on by the Examiner as teaching a vortex
structure. Final Act. 3. A "vortex" is defined as "a whirling mass of air,
fire, etc." The Random House College Dictionary 1476 (Rev. ed. 1980).
"Vortex' is also defined as "a mass of spinning air, liquid, etc., that pulls
things into its center." See http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/vortex (last visited August 23, 2016). Inspection of
the wind flow paths 3 in Figure 2a of Graf reveals that they are substantially
linear and not whirling or spinning in the manner of a vortex.

(referencing Banks 4:60 to S:2 and S:9-19). Appellants additionally assert:
"Banks is silent as to any method or technique for destabilizing a tornado.
Instead, Banks attempts to provide elongated assemblies which redirect wind
flows. Banks devotes efforts to mitigate damage resulting from high winds
instead of eliminating the source of the high winds." App. Br. 10.
Appellants further point out that the Examiner admits that "both Graf
and Banks attempt to protect structures by merely redirecting air flows."
App. Br. 10 (citing Final Act. 6, 7). Appellants contend: "It is unclear why
the Office views redirecting air flows as described by Graf and Banks to
somehow correspond to the recitation of claim 1 for destabilizing a tornado."
App. Br. 10.
Appellants' arguments are persuasive. Neither Graf nor Banks teach
methods or techniques for destabilizing a tornado. Rather, Graf and Banks
disclose the use of elements secured to a structure to be protected in order to
redirect winds that strike the structure. See, e.g., Graf, Figs. 2a, 2b; Banks,
Figs. SA, SB, 6, 7A-7F. Further, as noted in Footnote 2, supra, the linear
wind flow paths 3 illustrated in Figure 2a of Graf do not constitute a
dynamic atmospheric vortex structure under the broadest reasonable
interpretation of that term as alleged by the Examiner. Although the PTO
must give claims their broadest reasonable interpretation, this interpretation
must be consistent with the one that those skilled in the art would reach. In
re Cortright, 16S F. 3d 13S3, 13S8 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

For the foregoing reasons, and based on the record before us, we do
not sustain the Examiner's rejection of independent claim 1under3S U.S.C.
ยง 103 as unpatentable over Graf and Banks. We likewise do not sustain the

rejection of dependent claims 2 and 4--14 which are subject to the same
ground of rejection.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejection of claims 1, 2, and 4--14 is reversed.

REVERSED
