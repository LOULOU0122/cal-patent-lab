Application 13/113,126
Appellants 1 appeal under 35 U.S.C. ยง 134(a) from the Examiner's decision2
twice rejecting claims 1-17. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. ยง 6(b ).
We AFFIRM-IN-PART.
The invention relates to compositions that are useful for coating containers,
such as food and beverage containers. Specification filed May 23, 2011 ("Spec.")

i-f 1. According to the Specification, known coating compositions for food and
beverage containers are often based on epoxy resins that are polyglycidyl ethers of
bisphenol A ("BP A") or derivatives thereof, e.g., diglycidyl ethers of BP A
("BADGE"). Id. i-f 3. Due to a perception that these compounds are harmful to
human health, there is a desire to eliminate the use thereof in coatings for food and
beverage containers. Id. The inventors are said to have discovered a coating
composition that it is substantially free of BP A and derivatives thereof, yet
provides excellent adhesion to the substrate to which it is applied. Id. i-fi-1 4--7.
Of the appealed claims, claims 1 and 8 are independent, and read as follows:
1.

A coating composition comprising:
(a)
a resinous binder,
(b)
up to 10 percent by weight based on weight of resin
solids in the coating composition of a reaction product
compnsmg:
(i) a phosphorus acid, and
(ii) polyglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol.

8.

A coating composition comprising:
(a)
a resinous binder comprising:
(i)
an acrylic polymer having reactive functional
groups,
(ii) an aminoplast crosslinker having functional groups
reactive with the functional groups of (i),

Claims 2-7 and 11-17 depend from claim 1, and claims 9 and 10 depend
from claim 8.
The Examiner maintains the following grounds of rejection under 35 U.S.C.
ยง 103(a)3 :
1.

claims 1-7, 11, 16, and 17 as unpatentable over Sundararaman et al.

(US 6,159,549, issued December 12, 2000 ("Sundararaman")), alone, or in view of
Pawlik et al. (US 2004/0086718 Al, published May 6, 2004 ("Pawlik")); and
2.

claims 8-10 and 12-15 as unpatentable over Sundararaman in view of

Pawlik, and further in view ofCinoman et al. (US 2007/0260003 Al, published
November 8, 2007 ("Cinoman")). 4

The Examiner has withdrawn the provisional obviousness-type double patenting
rejection of claims 1-17 (see Non-Final Act. 2-3). Examiner's Answer mailed
February 4, 2015 ("Ans."), 9.
4
The Examiner makes a second ground of rejection of claims 8-10 and 12-15
based on the same combination of references and based on the same reasoning.
Compare Non-Final Act. 5-7, with id. at 8-11. The Examiner includes claims 4
and 6 in this second ground of rejection, but does not rely on Cinoman for a
teaching or suggestion of any claim 4 or claim 6 limitations. See id. at 8-9.
Rather, the Examiner's reasoning is identical to that stated in rejecting claims 4
and 6 over the combination of Sundararaman and Pawlik. Compare id. at 4, with
id. at 9. Accordingly, we dismiss this ground of rejection as it appears to be
duplicative of above-listed grounds of rejection 1 and 2. Cf The Manual of Patent
Examining Procedure (MPEP) ยง 706.02, p. 700-20 (8th ed. rev. 9, Aug. 2012)

Application 13/113,126

Rejection of claims 1-7, 11, 16, and 17 as unpatentable
over Sundararaman, alone, or in view of Pawlik

The Examiner finds Sundararaman discloses a coating composition
comprising a polyester-based resin component (Non-Final Act. 4, 7 (citing
Sundararaman 2:4--24)) and "about 1-25% by weight" (Sundararaman 3:21-23) of
an epoxy component that is "the product of a phosphoric acid ... and a
glycidylether[] of aliphatic diols or polyols" (Non-Final Act. 4, 7 (citing
Sundararaman 3:52-62)). The Examiner finds Sundararaman teaches the use of
"any suitable aromatic or cycloaliphatic epoxy resin ... known to those skilled in
the art after reading th[ e] specification" (Sundararaman 3 :44--46), but does not
disclose "polyglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol" explicitly. Non-Final
Act. 4, 7. The Examiner finds, however, that Sundararaman discloses cyclohexane
dimethanol is a suitable polyol for use in preparing the polyester-based resin
component and, therefore, one of ordinary skill in the art would have utilized "the
glycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol" for the epoxy component. Id. at 7. The
Examiner finds, in the alternative, that one of ordinary skill in the art would have
been motivated to look to the prior art for a suitable epoxy resin for use in
Sundararaman's coating composition, and would have been motivated to select
polyglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol based on Pawlik's successful use
thereof in a phosphatized coating composition. Id. at 4 (citing Pawlik i-fi-1 7-8).
Appellants argue both Sundararaman and Pawlik "cite a laundry list of
cycloaliphatic alcohols that can be used in their invention," but provide no
direction to select the specifically claimed polyol as opposed to any other suitable
epoxy resin. App. Br. 5; see also id. at 7-8; Reply Brief filed February 26, 2015
("Reply Br."), 1. Appellants argue one of ordinary skill in the art would not have
been motivated to look to Pawlik given Sundararaman's teaching that suitable

4

Appeal2015-004325
Application 13/113,126
epoxy components are apparent to the ordinary artisan after reading
Sundararaman's specification. App. Br. 3 (citing Sundararaman 3:44--46).
Appellants also argue the phosphatized epoxy in Pawlik's composition serves as
the main film former rather than as an adhesion promoter as in the claimed
composition. Id. at 4. Appellants thus contend Pawlik uses much higher amounts
of phosphatized polyglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol, and fails to teach or
suggest that the use of this compound in the amounts claimed would impart
suitable adhesion to the coating. Id.
Appellants rely on the Declaration of Youssef Moussa (id., Evidence
Appendix ("Moussa Deel.")) in support of their arguments. Id. at 5---6. Mr.
Moussa is a named inventor in the present application. Mr. Moussa testified that
although "the reaction of cycloaliphatic epoxies with phosphoric acid is similar to
the reaction of BP A epoxies and phosphoric acid[,] the resulting products ... differ
significantly in their final chemical structures." Moussa Deel. i-f 3. Mr. Moussa
further testified that because of these differences, "one skilled in the art would
have expected significant differences in the performance of coatings made from
these products. It was very surprising, therefore, that the performance of the two
coatings was the same." Id. Mr. Moussa testified that the ordinary artisan would
not have been motived to look to Pawlik, which teaches phosphatized epoxy as the
film former, for an adhesion promoter. Id. i-f 4. Mr. Moussa also testified that one
of ordinary skill in the art would not have understood from Pawlik that a
compound containing polyglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol in the
amounts claimed would provide the adhesion or performance results obtained with
the claimed coating composition because Pawlik's adhesion testing was performed
under a different, and less stringent set of conditions than typically used in the
packaging industry. Id.

5

Appeal2015-004325
Application 13/113,126
Appellants cite to the Examples in the Specification as evidence of a
surprising and unexpected discovery that a coating composition containing
polyglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol, as claimed, is comparable in
performance in packaging-related testing to similar coatings comprising
BP A/BADGE. App. Br. 4--5. The Specification describes comparison testing of
three clear varnish compositions containing the same ingredients and amounts
thereof with the exception of the ether component. According to the Specification,
the Example 1 composition, containing 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol diglycidyl
ether, performed as well as the Example 2 composition, containing bisphenol A
diglycidyl ether, when applied as a coating to an aluminum beverage can and
subjected to boiling water adhesion testing and detergent adhesion testing (i.e.,
there was no adhesion loss). See Spec. i-fi-141--48. Example C, which did not
contain an ether component, showed 40% and 90% adhesion loss, respectively, in
the same tests. See id. i-fi-1 46--48.
In response to Appellants' arguments, the Examiner contends Sundararaman
"teaches that even though there are significant differences between epoxies, ...
cycloaliphatic and aromatic epoxies have a similar result when used in their
coating composition." Ans. 10. The Examiner's position is supported by
Sundararaman's disclosure at column 3, lines 44--57. The Examiner further asserts
that Pawlik is relied on solely to teach that phosphatized polyglycidyl ether of
cyclohexane dimethanol is a known epoxy resin in the coating art, and is not relied
on for a disclosure of suitable concentrations thereof in a coating composition. Id.
at 11. Appellants have not shown error in this finding with respect to Pawlik, nor
have Appellants argued convincingly that the ordinary artisan would not have been
motivated to select "polyglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol out of the
myriad of aromatic or cycloaliphatic epoxy resins alluded to by ... Pawlik" (Reply

6

Appeal2015-004325
Application 13/113,126
1), given Pawlik' s identification of cyclohexane dim ethanol as a specific example
of a suitable polyhydric alcohol for use in forming a polyglycidyl ether of
polyhydric alcohol that improves adhesion to a metal substrate (Pawlik i-fi-1 6-8
("An example of a suitable cycloaliphatic alcohol is cyclohexanedimethanol.")).
See PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. ViaCell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342, 1364 (Fed.

Cir. 2007) (explaining that an obviousness rejection predicated on selection of one
or more components from numerous possible choices may be appropriate if the
prior art provides direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be
successful).
With respect to the Examiner's reliance on Sundararaman, alone, we are
persuaded by Appellants' argument that Sundararaman' s disclosure of cyclohexane
dimethanol as a suitable polyhydric alcohol for use in forming the polyester resin
component of Sundararaman' s coating does not provide the requisite guidance to
the ordinary artisan to select cyclohexane dimethanol for use in forming the
phosphatized epoxy resin.
Turning to the Moussa Declaration and Specification Examples, we agree
with the Examiner's finding that this evidence is not persuasive of nonobviousness.
See Ans. 9-10. As noted by the Examiner, the Specification Examples show that a

coating composition containing the claimed cycloaliphatic epoxy resin provides
adhesion equal to that of a coating composition containing BADGE, but fail to
show that the claimed coating composition provides an unexpected, superior result
as compared to a coating composition containing a different cycloaliphatic epoxy
resin in the claimed amounts. See id. at 10. We have considered Mr. Moussa's
testimony that the claimed invention provides unexpected results and that an
ordinary artisan would not have been motivated to look to Pawlik for a suitable
cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, but accord little weight to this testimony because it is

7

Appeal2015-004325
Application 13/113,126
(1) the opinion of one of the named inventors, (2) unsupported by evidence, and

(3) does not address the Examiner's findings that Sundararaman column 3, lines
44--46 suggest that "cycloaliphatic and aromatic epoxies have a similar result when
used in [Sundararaman's] coating composition." Ans. 10; see In re Am. Acad. of
Sci. Tech. Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (noting the Board is entitled
to weigh declarations expressing opinions as to fact and conclude that the lack of
factual corroboration warrants discounting the opinions expressed in the
declarations); In re Bulina, 362 F.2d 555, 559 (CCPA 1966) ("[A]n affidavit by an
applicant or co-applicant as to the advantages of his invention is less persuasive
than one made by a disinterested person.").
In sum, we are persuaded of reversible error in the Examiner's rejection of
claims 1-7, 11, 16, and 17 as unpatentable over Sundararaman, alone, and,
therefore, reverse this ground of rejection. We agree with the Examiner that a
preponderance of the evidence, taking into account Appellants' evidence of
unexpected results, weighs in favor of obviousness of claims 1-7, 11, 16, and 17
over the combination of Sundararaman and Pawlik. We affirm this ground of
rejection.
Rejection of claims 8-10 and 12-15 as unpatentable
over Sundararaman in view ofPawlik and Cinoman
Unlike independent claim 1, independent claim 8 specifies that the resinous
binder comprises an acrylic polymer. As noted above, claims 9 and 10 depend
from claim 8, and claims 12-15 depend from claim 1 via their dependence on
claim 11. Claim 11 recites a coated article comprising a substrate having a coating
comprising the composition of claim 1 deposited thereon. Claim 12 recites that the
claim 11 substrate comprises a container.

8

Appeal2015-004325
Application 13/113,126
With respect to claims 8-10, the Examiner finds Sundararaman and Pawlik
are silent regarding the use of an acrylic polymer in their coating materials. NonFinal Act. 5. The Examiner finds "Cinoman teach[ es] that it is known in the art to
add binder resins including polyesters and acrylics to phosphatized coating
materials." Id. The Examiner further finds one of ordinary skill in the art would
have been motivated to modify Sundararaman's coating composition by either
replacing the polyester resin with, or simply adding, Cinoman's acrylic polymer
based on "the successful practice of the invention of Cinoman." Id.
Appellants argue the Examiner has not explained sufficiently the motivation
for modifying Sundararaman's composition to include an acrylic polymer, noting
Sundararaman does not teach or suggest the use of any type of resin other than a
polyester resin. See App. Br. 6-7.
With respect to claims 12-15, the Examiner finds Sundararaman teaches
applying the disclosed coating composition as a protective coating to metals, but
does not specify containers. Non-Final Act. 6. The Examiner finds Cinoman
teaches applying phosphatized coating materials to a metal, as well as cans or
bottles, as a corrosion resistant coating. Id. The Examiner determines it would
have been obvious to apply Sundararaman's coating to a container as recited in
claims 12 and 13 because "this is merely using a known substance for a known
purpose," and that it would have been obvious to apply the coating composition to
the exterior of the container as recited in claims 145 and 15 because the
composition prevents corrosion. Id.

5

We note that claim 14, which depends from claim 11, is in improper dependent
form because claim 11 does not provide antecedent basis for the recitation: "the
container."
9

Appeal2015-004325
Application 13/113,126
Appellants argue the Examiner's obviousness determination as to claims 1215 is not supported by Sundararaman's disclosure. See App. Br. 7. Specifically,
Appellants note that Sundararaman is "directed to coatings for structural building
components, for which durability to weather conditions is particularly desired,"
and "[t]here is no teaching or suggestion in Sundararaman that those coatings are
suitable for packaging." Id.
The Examiner's response to Appellants' arguments in support of
patentability of claims 8-10 and 12-15 is limited to a statement that Cinoman is a
teaching reference that "teaches a certain concept, and in combination with the
primary reference, discloses the presently claimed invention." Ans. 12.
"[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere
conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with
some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness." In re
Kahn, 441F.3d977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoted with approval in KSR Int'! Co. v.
Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007)); see also In re Vaidyanathan, 381 Fed.

App'x. 985, 994 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (non-precedential) ("KSR did not free the PTO's
examination process from explaining its reasoning. In making an obviousness
rejection, the examiner should not rely on conclusory statements that a particular
feature of the invention would have been obvious or was well known. Instead, the
examiner should elaborate, discussing the evidence or reasoning that leads the
examiner to such a conclusion.").
We have considered the respective positions of the Examiner and
Appellants, and agree with the Appellants that the Examiner has not provided the
requisite articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning in finding the
ordinary artisan would have been motivated to modify Sundararaman in view of
Cinoman. Rather, it appears the Examiner has simply identified where each of the

10

Appeal2015-004325
Application 13/113,126
claim elements was known independently in the prior art, and then relied on
improper hindsight reasoning in determining it would have been obvious to
combine these elements in the manner claimed. See KSR, 550 U.S. at 421.
Accordingly, we reverse the rejection of claims 8-10 and 12-15 over the
combination of Sundararaman, Pawlik, and Cinoman.

Conclusion
The Examiner's decision to reject claims 1-7, 11, 16, and 17 is AFFIRMED.
The Examiner's decision to reject claims 8-10 and 12-15 is REVERSED.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this
appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. ยง 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
