Before DONALD E. ADAMS, TAWEN CHANG, and
RACHEL H. TOWNSEND, Administrative Patent Judges.
CHANG, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 involving claims to methods
of testing blood for reaction to a substance, which have been rejected as
anticipated. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We affirm.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
According to the Specification, one of the objectives of the invention
is to assure "a smooth and reproducible procedure" when blood is used as a
biological test system. (Spec. 3.) Further according to the Specification,

Appellants identify the Real Party in Interest as the inventors, Albrecht
Wendel and Thomas Hartung. (Appeal Br. 3.)

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
this objective may be achieved by use of deep-frozen blood, which may be
thawed before the material to be tested is brought into contact with the
blood. (Id. at 3--4.)
Claims 23-28 and 35--46 are on appeal. Claim 23 is illustrative and
reads as follows:
23.

A method of testing blood for reaction to a substance
comprising the steps of:
- selecting a cryopreserved unit dose comprising a
blood product including viable white blood cells and a
cryopreservative from among a plurality of identical
cryopreserved unit doses obtained from a single or
pooled sample of blood taken from a human or
animal;
thawing the cryopreserved unit dose;
contacting the thawed, cryopreserved unit dose with
the substance; and
determining, by biological, physical, chemical, or
physicochemical means, whether the viable white
blood cells in the unit dose react with the substance in
an immunofi.1nctional, toxic, or modulator'/ blood
reaction.

The claims stand rejected as follows:
Claims 23, 24, 26, 27, and 35--46 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b) as being anticipated by Lionetti. 2
Claims 23-28 and 35--46 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as

Issue

The Examiner rejected claims 23, 24, 26, 27, and 35--46 under
35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as being anticipated by Lionetti. The Examiner finds
that Lionetti discloses a method for "the freezing of granulocytes of
peripheral blood and the production of a substantial yield of thawed viable
cells as determined by in vitro characteristics." 4 (Ans. 3.)
Among other things, the Examiner finds that Lionetti discloses "the
cryopreservation of concentrated [white blood cells] being frozen at -80Q C."
(Id. at 5.) The Examiner finds that Lionetti teaches freezing the white cells

"with a combination of HES, which functions as both a sedimenting and
cryoprotective agent, and DMSO, a cryoprotective agent." (Id. at 4.) The
Examiner finds that Lionetti teaches cryopreservation of concentrated white
blood cells in the form of "2ml aliquots of leukocytes ... placed in plastic
... tubes" as well as in the form of "55ml bags containing cells." 5 (Id. at 5.)
The Examiner finds that Lionetti discloses thawing the white blood cells and
analyzing them in various ways, including via a bacterial growth inhibition
assay where the white blood cells are contacted with E. coli. (Id. at 5---6.)
Appellants contend that Lionetti does not disclose "selecting a ... unit
dose ... from among a plurality of identical cryopreserved unit doses .... "
(Appeal Br. 12-14.) Appellants further contend that Lionetti fails to teach
"the combined steps of [1] 'contacting the ... [leukocyte-containing] unit dose
with the substance' and [2] 'determining ... whether... an immunofunctional,

4

"[G]ranulocytes are white blood cells." (Ans. 3.)
Leukocytes are also white blood cells. (See generally Lionetti 2:67
("Leukocytes, i.e. white cells").)

5

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
toxic or modulatory blood reaction' occurs between 'leukocytes' and
'substance."' (Id. at 14 (alteration original).)
Appellants do not separately argue the claims. Thus, we limit our
discussion to claim 23 as representative. 6 The issue with respect to this
rejection is whether the evidence of record supports the Examiner's finding
that Lionetti disclose each element of claim 23.

Findings of Fact
FF 1. Lionetti relates to a "method of salvaging granulocytes, or white
cells, from ... centrifuged whole blood" by freezing the white blood cells.
(Lionetti Abstract, 1:6-10; see Ans. 3.)
FF2. Lionetti teaches freezing the white blood cells through "a
combination of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), which functions as both a
sedimenting agent and a cryoprotective agent, and dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), a cryoprotective agent." (Id. at Abstract, 2: 10-16; see generally
Ans. 3--4.)
FF3. Lionetti teaches a sedimentation procedure to isolate white
blood cells where "[ s]edimentation was undertaken ... using the same
volume of cells, dilutions and [HES] concentrations" and where white blood

6

To the extent Appellants separately argued claim 41 in their Reply Brief
(Reply Br. 8), that argument is untimely because Appellants did not
separately argue claim 41 in the Appeal Brief. Ex parte Borden, 93 USPQ2d
1473 (BPAI 2010). In any event, Appellants state that claim 41 "essentially
defines the same subject matter as (independent) claims 23 and 35." (Reply
Br. 8.) Thus, there can be no dispute that claim 23 is representative of claim
41.

Application 10/7 61,23 7
cells are then cryopreserved in bags or in plastic tubes. (Id. at 4:38---68; see
Ans. 5.)
FF4. Lionetti teaches expressing white blood cell enriched
supematants resulting from the sedimentation procedure, "about 50---60 ml,"
into small platelet preservation bags. (Id. at 4:38--49; see Ans. 5.) Lionetti
teaches that these suspensions from the sedimentation procedure, "about 55
ml containing 6 x 108 white cells, were frozen by placing the bags flat in the
freezer at-80Q C." (Id. at 4:58-61; see generally Ans. 5, 11, and 13.)
FF5. Lionetti also teaches placing "[t]wo milliliter aliquots,
approximately 2 x 107 cells, of leukocytes isolated by sedimentation ... in
polyethylene plastic tubes ... and [freezing them] at 2Q C/min. to -80Q C."
(Id. at 4:52-55; see generally Ans. 5.)

FF6. Lionetti teaches that "[r]esidual HES remaining after
sedimentation was the cryoprotective agent for half the units studied" while
the remaining units also received 5% DMSO. (Id. at 4:47--49, 61---64; see
generally Ans. 4--5.)

FF7. Lionetti teaches thawing the tubes and plastic bags of frozen
white blood cells. (Id. at 5: 1-7; see Ans. 5.)
FF8. Lionetti teaches "a method of determining the feasibility of
thawed cells by tests involving [the cells'] ability to inhibit growth of
Escherichia (E.) coli," which serve as a means to describe the capacity of
cryopreserved granulocytes to undergo the ingestion aspect of phagocytosis.
(Id. at 2:24--28, 10:59---62; see generally Ans. 5-6.)

FF9. In particular, Lionetti teaches that "[t]hawed granulocytes, 0.5
ml, isolated by the sedimentation procedure with HES[,] were diluted to 15.0

5

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
ml with Normosol," further diluted, and added to proliferating E. coli. (Id.
at 6:9-14; see Ans. 5.)
FF 10. Lionetti teaches counting the bacteria in the mixture of white
blood cells and E. coli and also teaches taking photographs of white blood
cells removed from the mixture, which revealed ingested bacteria within the
phagocytes (not shown). (Id. at 9:63---65; see Ans. 5-6.)
FF 11. Lionetti teaches studies conducted with leukocytes sedimented
with dextran or polyvinylpyrrolidone and then frozen with 10 and 15%
DMSO in the presence or absence of glucose. (Id. at 10:63---66.) Lionetti
teaches determining the phagocytic index for thawed cells diluted with
plasma to 2% or 1% DMSO. (Id. at 10:68-11 :9; see generally Ans. 6.)
FF12. Lionetti provides data relating to trypan exclusion and
myeloperoxidase activity for post-thawed leukocyte cryopreserved with
either HES or HES and DMSO, where the cells were either washed or not
washed after thawing. (Id. at Table 2, 8:58-9:41, 11: 13-24.)
Analysis

We find that the evidence of record supports the Examiner's finding
that Lionetti anticipates claim 23. Lionetti teaches freezing white blood
cells obtained from a sedimentation procedure in bags of about 55 ml
containing 6 x 10 8 white cells as well as in two millimeter aliquots (FF4,
FF5), which constitute "a plurality of identical cryopreserved unit doses
obtained from a single or pooled sample of blood." (Appeal Br. 18 (Claims
App'x).) Lionetti teaches thawing the aliquots of white blood cells. (FF7.)
Lionetti teaches contacting the thawed cells with E. coli to determine

6

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
whether the white cells inhibit E. coli growth (i.e., has an imnmnofunctional
reaction to E. coli). (FF8-FF10.)
Appellants argue that Lionetti does not disclose "a plurality of
identical cryopreserved unit doses" because Lionetti discloses that white
blood cell-enriched supematants from the sedimentation procedure, "about
50-60 ml," are expressed into small platelet preservation bags. (Appeal Br.
13.) Appellants thus contend that these frozen supematants cannot
constitute identical unit doses because they contain variable amounts (i.e.,
between 50 and 60 ml) of white blood cells. (Id.)
We are not persuaded. As the Examiner points out, Lionetti more
specifically discloses that the suspensions from the sedimentation procedure
are frozen in units of "about 55 ml containing 6 x 10 8 white cells." (Ans.
13-14; FF4.) Moreover, as the Examiner also points out, Lionetti further
discloses cryopreserving white blood cells in two millimeter aliquots in
polyethylene tubes. (Ans. 14; FF5.)
Appellants contend that the two millimeter aliquots Lionetti discloses
do not constitute identical units within the meaning of claim 23 because
Lionetti Table 2 shows that there is a 50% standard deviation in the number
of cells among the two millimeter aliquots.
This argument is unpersuasive. "[I]n proceedings before the PTO,
claims in an application are to be given their broadest reasonable
interpretation consistent with the specification." In re Sneed, 710 F .2d 1544,
1548 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The Specification does not define "identical" unit
dose; however, in discussing "unit doses" the Specification repeatedly refers
to units of particular volume. (Spec. 9-10 ("The unit dose usually contains
from 50 to 500 micro liters, preferably 100 micro liters, of whole blood, but it
7

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
is not limited to those quantities. . . . The volume of whole blood that can
be drawn at one time from a healthy human donor allows preparation of
several thousand unit doses of, for example, 100 microliters.").) Thus, the
broadest reasonable interpretation of the term "identical ... unit doses"
encompasses doses that are identical in, e.g., source and volume, despite
some variation in number of cells.
Appellants further contend that Lionetti fails to teach "the combined
steps of [1] 'contacting the ... [leukocyte-containing] unit dose with the
substance' and [2] 'determining ... whether... an immunofunctional, toxic or
modulatory blood reaction' occurs between 'leukocytes' and 'substance."'
(Appeal Br. 14 (alteration original).) We are not convinced. The Examiner
has explained where and how these claim elements are disclosed in Lionetti
(Final Act. 6-7; Ans. 5-7; see FF1-FF12), and Appellants fail to provide
any evidence or argument in the Appeal Brief as to why the Examiner's
articulation of the prima facie case with respect to these claim limitations are
insufficient.
In their Reply Brief, Appellants argue for the first time that Lionetti
fails to teach "contacting the ... unit dose with the substance" and
"determining [... ] whether the viable white blood cells in the unit dose react
with the substance" because Lionetti "require that [white blood cells] be
isolated from any cryopreservation media before the [white blood cells] are
contacted with any substance for testing." (Reply 2-5.) Appellants have
provided no explanation why this new argument could not have been
presented in the Appeal Brief; accordingly, Appellants' new argument is
untimely. Ex parte Borden, 93 USPQ2d 1473 (BPAI 2010). In any event,

8

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
we are not persuaded by Appellants' argument. (FF2, FF6, FF9, FFl 1,
FF12.)
Finally, Appellants argue that "[a]ppealed claims provide, for the first
time, the use of a blood product as a reagent in the testing of various
substances for their suitability." (Reply Br. 8-9 (emphasis omitted).) In
contrast, Appellants argue that Lionetti "describe the testing for safety and
efficacy of a blood product, to be used in the treatment of humans, by
contacting the blood product with a variety of reagent substances." (Id.)
However, Appellants' argument in this regard does not point out any
additional claim limitations that are not disclosed by Lionetti.
Accordingly, we find that Lionetti anticipates claim 23. Claims 24,
26, 27, and 35--46 have not been argued separately and therefore fall with
claim 23.
II.
Issue

The Examiner rejected claims 23-28 and 35--46 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b) as being anticipated by Boyse. The Examiner finds that Boyse
discloses cryopreservation of neonatal or fetal hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells and the therapeutic use of such cells upon thawing. (Ans.
7.)
The Examiner finds that Table III of Boyse shows samples of cord
blood collected from infants. (Id. at 17-18.) The Examiner finds that these
samples comprise "blood product[s] that [are] whole blood and includes
viable ... white blood cells." (Id. at 9.) The Examiner finds that Boyse
discloses layering 1 ml portions of cell suspensions created from cord blood
9

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
stem and progenitor cells on top of cryoprotective medium in vials that are
frozen and then subsequently thawed and analyzed. (Id. at 18.) The
Examiner finds that Boyse discloses "creating a plurality of identical [unit
doses]" by aliquoting cell suspension from a single sample into multiple
tubes, bags and vials. (Id.) The Examiner further finds that Boyse discloses
use of a cryoprotective agent such as DMSO. (Id. at 8.)
The Examiner finds that Boyse discloses "thawed cells [being] tested
by standard assays of viability (trypan blue exclusion) and ... microbial
sterility, and tested to confirm and/or determine their identity relative to the
patient, and for hematopoietic function." (Id. at 17.) For instance, the
Examiner finds that Boyse discloses "numerous assays for hematopoietic
stem or progenitor cells where various factors, alone or in combination[,] are
tested for stimulation of colony formation upon inclusion in the blood
culture mixture." (Id. at 9.) The Examiner finds that, "[t]herefore, [Boyse]
disclose[s] determining whether the viable white blood cells in the unit dose
reacts with a variety of stimulator substances in an immunofunctional, toxic,
or modulatory blood reaction." (Id. at 17; see also id. at 8.)
Appellants contend that Boyse does not disclose "'selecting ... from
among ... identical ... [white-blood-cell containing] unit doses'" or
"selecting a unit dose from a plurality of identical cryopreserved unit doses."

(Appeal Br. 15, 16.) Appellants further contend that Boyse fails to teach
"the combined steps of [ 1] 'contacting the ... unit dose with the substance'
and [2] 'determining ... whether ... an immunofunctional, toxic or
modulatory blood reaction' occurs between 'leukocytes' and 'substance."'
(Id. at 16.)

10

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
Appellants do not separately argue the claims. 7 Thus, we limit our
discussion to claim 23 as representative. The issue with respect to this
rejection is whether the evidence of record supports the Examiner's finding
that Boyse disclose each element of claim 23.

Findings of Fact

FF 13. Boyse relates to "hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of
neonatal or fetal blood that are cryopreserved, and the therapeutic uses of
such stem and progenitor cells upon thawing." (Boyse Abstract; see also id.
at 8:43--46, 10:28-31; see generally Ans. 7.)
FF 14. Boyse teaches that, "[i]n a preferred embodiment of the
invention, the neonatal blood sample as thawed can be infused for
hematopoietic reconstitution. Thus, it is envisioned that whole neonatal
blood, cryopreserved and thawed, can be infused for therapy." (Id. at 24:64-68; see also id. at 18:59---62, 39:48-52; see generally Ans. 7.)
FF15. Boyse teaches using cryoprotective agents, including DMSO,
in cryopreserving cells. (Id. at 23: 1-2; see generally Ans. 8.)
FF 16. Boyse teaches using "[ s]ealed plastic vials ... or glass ampules
can be used for multiple small amounts (1-2 ml), while larger volumes
(100-200 ml) can be frozen in polyolefin bags .... " (Id. at 23:55---60; see
Ans. 8.)
FFl 7. Boyse teaches a protocol for cryopreserving viable
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells derived from human cord and
placental blood comprising creating a cell suspension and then, "[i]n a

7

See supra note 6.
11

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
cryovial containing 1 ml of a chilled, sterile cryoprotective medium of 20%
DMSO/RPMI-1640, carefully layer[ing] a 1 ml portion of the ... cell
suspension on top of the cryoprotective medium" before placing the vials in
a freezing rack. (Id. at 43:49---68; see generally Ans. 16 and 18.)
FF 18. Boyse teaches a service comprising collecting cord blood from
an infant and allocating cells of each individual to "four cryules [i.e.,
standard freezing vials], two of which are assigned for storage to one freezer
and two to another, independently-serviced, freezer." (Id. at 59:35---60:68;
see generally Ans. 7-8 and 17-18.)

FF 19. Boyse teaches that
[t]he cryoprotective agent, if toxic in humans, should be
removed prior to therapeutic use of the thawed neonatal stem
and progenitor cells. In an embodiment employing DMSO as
the cryopreservative, it is preferable to omit this step in order to
avoid cell loss, since DMSO has no serious toxicity. . . . One
way in which to remove the cryoprotective agent is by dilution
to an insignificant concentration.
(Id. at 25:12-21; see generally Ans. 8 and 18-19.)

FF20. Boyse teaches that
[i]n a preferred ... aspect of the invention, thawed cells are
tested by standard assays of viability (e.g., trypan blue
exclusion) and of microbial sterility ... , and tested to confirm
and/or determine their identity relative to the patient, and for
hematopoietic function. . . . Methods for identity testing which
can be used include but are not limited to HLA (the major
histocompatibility complex in man) typing ... , and DNA
fingerprinting, which can be used to establish the genetic
identity of the cells.
(Id. at 25:50-26:64; see generally Ans. 8-9.)

12

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7

Analysis
We find the preponderance of evidence supports the Examiner's
finding that Boyse anticipates claim 23. Boyse discloses cryopreserving
neonatal blood with a cryopreservative such as DMSO. (FF14, FF15.)
Boyse discloses cryopreserving viable stem and progenitor cells derived
from human cord and placental blood by combining 1 ml portions of a cell
suspension with 1 ml of cryoprotective medium in cryovials for freezing.
(FF 17; see also FF 18 (describing a service comprising collecting cord blood
and allocating cells from each individual to four separate cryules ). ) Boyse
describes thawing the cryopreserved neonatal blood and/or cells and testing
them via different assays. (FF13, FF14, FF20).
Appellants argue that Boyse does not suggest "'selecting ... from
among .. .identical...[ white-blood-cell containing] unit doses,' as in the
rejected claims," because "the multiple samples 'CB-1 ' -'CB-111 "' set forth
in Table III of Boyse and cited by the Examiner "have different 'Total
Volume[s]. "' (Appeal Br. 15-16 (alteration original).) We are not
convinced. Boyse discloses, e.g., cryopreserving viable stem and progenitor
cells derived from human cord and placental blood by combining 1 ml
portions of a cell suspension with 1 ml of cryoprotective medium in
cryovials for freezing. (Ans. 18; see also FF16-FF18.)
In the Reply, Appellants do not appear to dispute that Boyse's
cryovials constitute identical unit doses. Nevertheless, Appellants argue that
Boyse does not anticipate claim 23 because Boyse isolates the blood cells
from such cryovials prior to conducting assays and thus does not teach
"contacting the [entire] thawed, cryopreserved unit dose [of WBCs and a
cryopreservative] with the substance" and "determining ... whether the
13

Appeal2013-010345
Application 10/7 61,23 7
viable white blood cells in the unit dose react with the substance." (Reply
Br. 7-8.)
Appellants' argument is not persuasive. While Boyse does disclose a
method that pellets thawed cells in the cryovials by centrifugation and
subsequently separating the cells from the supernatant, Boyse also teaches
that, in preferred embodiments, cryopreservative should not be removed, in
order to avoid cell loss. (FFl 9; see also Boyse 51:35--40 (Ficoll-Hypaque
cell separation and DMSO removal are two steps that are omitted in a
preferred embodiment of the invention).)
Finally, we note but do not find persuasive Appellants' statements in
the Appeal Brief that Boyse does not anticipate the claims because "the ...
claim limitation to selecting a unit dose from a plurality of identical
cryopreserved unit doses 'negates anticipation"' and "the combined steps of
[ 1] 'contacting the ... [leukocyte-containing] unit dose with the substance' and
[2] 'determining ... whether... an immunofunctional, toxic or modulatory blood
reaction' occurs between 'leukocytes' and 'substance"' fails to "'identically
appear' in the reference disclosure." (Appeal Br. 16-17 (alteration
original).) The Examiner has explained where and how these claim
elements are disclosed in Boyse (Final Act. 7-10), and Appellants fail to
articulate with any specificity why the prima facie case with respect to these
claim limitations are insufficient.
Claims 24--28 and 35--46 have not been argued separately and,
therefore, fall with claim 23.

SUMMARY
We affirm the rejection of claims 23, 24, 26, 27, and 35--46 as
anticipated by Lionetti. We further affirm the rejection of claims 23-28 and
