STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The claims relate to a system for providing content to a plurality of
handheld devices. See Abstract. Claims 26 and 31 are independent. An
understanding of the invention can be derived from a reading of exemplary
Claim 26, which is reproduced below with some formatting added:
26.

A wireless portable device comprising:

a wireless transceiver through which to communicate
with a network;
a memory; and
a processor in communication with the wireless
transceiver and the memory,
wherein the processor is operative to:
detect an available connection to the network; and
after a connection to the network is available, select and
download a play list from a list of playlists stored in a server in
the network, wherein the playlists are created by peer wireless
portable devices, wherein the wireless portable devices are
peers to one another but not to the server.

ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the rejections of Claims 26-39, 41, and 42 in light
of Appellants' arguments that the Examiner erred. We have considered in
this decision only those arguments Appellants actually raised in the Briefs.
Any other arguments which Appellants could have made but chose not to
make in the Briefs are deemed to be waived. See 37 C.F.R.

§ 41.37(c)(l)(iv). We are not persuaded that Appellants identify reversible
error. We adopt the Examiner's finings and provide the following
explanation to highlight and address specific arguments and findings
primarily for emphasis.
We consider Appellants' arguments seriatim, as they are presented in
the Appeal Brief, pages 3-7.

Application 11/964,238
INDEPENDENT CLAIMS 26, 27, AND 28-30: OBVIOUSNESS OVER JONES AND
GIBBS
Independent Claim 26 recites, inter alia, "download a playlist from a
list of playlists stored in a server in the network, wherein the playlists are
created by peer wireless portable devices." The Examiner finds Jones
substantially teaches Claim 26, but Jones does not teach downloading a
playlist from a server or that the playlists were created by devices that are
peers to one another but not to the server. Final Act. 4. The Examiner finds
Gibbs teaches sharing content between multiple devices that are peers to
each other and Gibbs teaches playlists. Id.
Appellants argue there is no teaching in Gibbs of a server that stores
peer-created playlists for downloading to other peer devices. App. Br. 4.
Rather, Gibbs teaches a peer-to-peer system wherein a track list, not a
playlist, is directly transmitted between peer devices. Id. at 5. Moreover,
Appellants argue Jones' server is not a peer device and does not store
playlists. Id.
The Examiner finds Jones teaches storing and downloading songs
from a server, which may be a peer device. Ans. 8. Jones does not teach a
playlist, which, under the broadest reasonable interpretation, is a "'fixed
song sequence."' Id. (citing Spec., i-f 9). Examiner finds Gibbs teaches
sharing content between multiple devices that are peers to each other. Ans.
9. Gibbs teaches a track list is exchanged among the peers. Id. The
Examiner finds a track list is a listing of songs and thus, reads on a playlist.

Id.
Appellants concede Gibbs teaches a playlist: "the communication of a
playlist in Gibbs is between peer wireless devices." Reply Br. 3. Rather,

Appeal2015-000455
Application 11/964,238
Appellants contend the proposed combination of Jones and Gibbs does not
teach a server that stores peer-created playlists for downloading other peer
devices. Id.
Appellants' arguments are not persuasive. We agree with the
Examiner that Jones teaches a server-centric system for storing and
broadcasting music-related content. We also agree that provisioning Jones'
server with Gibbs' peer-created playlist is likely to be "a combination of
familiar elements according to known methods" which "is likely to be
obvious" because "it does no more than yield predictable results." KSR
Int'!. Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 401 (2007).

Appellants do not separately argue dependent Claims 28-30. Nor do
they separately argue Claim 27 which is rejected over Jones, Gibbs, and
Nunome.

INDEPENDENT CLAIM

31

Independent claim 31 recites, inter alia, "performing the following in
a server: receiving user preference information from a wireless portable
device; generating a recommended playlist based on the received user
preference information." Appellants contend the Examiner finds Plastina
teaches these limitations. App. Br. 6. Appellants argue Plastina teaches a
software playlist generator that is resident on the user's device, but not on
the server, as claimed. Id.
The Examiner finds Plastina teaches the software comprising the
experience monitoring and playlist generating modules may optionally
reside on the server. Ans. 11 (citing Plastina, col. 15, 11. 57---63).

5

Appeal2015-000455
Application 11/964,238
Appellants reiterate Plastina's playlist generator resides on the user's
device, not on the server, as claimed. Reply Br. 3.
Appellants' contentions are not persuasive. Plastina does not limit the
teachings to user devices: "In some embodiments, the method is
implemented in software that resides on multiple user devices." Plastina,
col. 15, 11. 23-25. However, as found by the Examiner (Ans. 11), "all of the
user's data (content and metadata) can be roamed to a central server."
Plastina, col. 15, 11. 58-59.
Appellants do not separately argue the dependent claims.

DECISION
The rejection of Claims 26-39, 41, and 42 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 is
affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
