BROWN, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEivIENT OF THE CASE
Gary A. Jordan and Ronald A. Sahatjian (Appellants) appeal under 35
U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1-9. We
have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b ).
We REVERSE.
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claim 1, reproduced below, is representative of the claimed subject
matter:
1.
A radially-expandable implant for implantation in a bodily
passageway, the implant comprising a stent having a main body
extending from an inside surface to an outside surface and from
a first end to a second end thereof; the main body comprising a
shape-memory polymer and being expandable from an initial

Appeal2015-000957
Application 13/887,813
unexpanded state to an expanded state, wherein the outside
surface of the main body forms an outwardly extending
geometric pattern comprising helical or annular rings.
Appeal Br. 11 (Claims App.) (emphasis added).
REJECTIONS
I.

Claims 1--4 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as anticipated

by Gianotti (US 5,993,483, issued Nov. 30, 1999).
II.

Claims 5 and 6 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as

unpatentable over Gianotti and Banas (US 6,004,348, issued Dec. 21, 1999).
III.

Claims 5, 8, and 9 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as

unpatentable over Gianotti and Quigley (US 2007/0208421 Al, published
Sept. 6, 2007).
IV.

Claim 7 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable

over Gianotti and Martakos (US 5,897 ,587, issued Apr. 27, 1999).
ANALYSIS

Rejection I
The Examiner finds that Gianotti discloses a stent having a main
body 2, 3 comprising a shape-memory polymer, such as polyurethane or
polyethylene. Final Act. 2-3 (citing Gianotti, col. 4, 11. 52---60). Gianotti
states that "[t]he wires 2 and 3 may be made of a metallic material, e.g.
stainless steel, which may be filled with a radiopaque core, or made of a
thermoplastic polymer, such as polyesters, polyurethanes, polycarbonates,
polysulphides, polypropylene, polyethylene or polysulphonates." Gianotti,
col. 4, 11. 52-57. The Examiner notes that Appellants disclose that
polyethylene and polyurethane are suitable shape memory polymers. Final
Act. 2 (citing Spec. i-fi-120-21 ). Appellants' Specification describes that stent

2

Appeal2015-000957
Application 13/887,813
104 comprises a shape memory polymer (SMP), and lists examples of SMPs
that can be used, including polyethylene and polyurethane. Spec. 4, 1. 22-5,

1. 1. The Examiner determines that "since the same material is disclosed
then its intended use is also inherently present, such that Gianotti' s implant
formed from polyurethane and/or polyethylene is capable of exhibiting
shape memory characteristics." Final Act. 2 (emphasis added).

In contrast, Appellants contend that Gianotti does not disclose a main
body comprising a shape-memory polymer. Appeal Br. 6. Appellants
contend that Gianotti does not mention the term "shape memory," or any
synonymous language, and thus, the rejection "appears to rely on
inherency." Id. at 6-7. Appellants assert that "simply because
Gianotti discloses materials that can be used as or in shape-memory
polymers does not necessarily mean that Gianotti's disclosure of such
materials inherently have shape-memory properties. Mere capability is
insufficient to establish a rejection on the basis of inherency." Id. at 7.
Appellants also assert that:
It is known that shape-memory properties are not inherent in

single polymers. Adreas Lendlein and Steffen Kelch, ShapeMemory Polymers, 2002, 41 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2034, 2035
(June 17, 2002) [hereafter, "Lendlein"]. Indeed, "[t]he shape
memory effect is not related to a specific material property of
single polymers; it rather results from a combination of the
polymer structure and the polymer morphology together with the
applied processing and programming technology." Id.
Appeal Br. 7.
The Examiner responds that:
both of the devices (prior art and applicant's device) possess the
same utility and employ the same polymeric material therefore,
the characteristic of the polymer, to exhibit a shape memory
effect, can be presumed to be inherent since the composition,
3

Appeal2015-000957
Application 13/887,813
structure and function are the same. Therefore, Gianotti's
implant having a main body formed from polyurethane and/or
polyethylene is capable of exhibiting a shape memory
characteristics.

Ans. 5 (emphasis added).
Appellants' contentions are persuasive. A reference inherently
discloses a claim element "if that missing characteristic is necessarily
present, or inherent, in the single anticipating reference." Schering Corp. v.
Geneva Pharms., 339 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citation omitted)

(emphasis added). "Inherency, however, may not be established by
probabilities or possibilities. The mere fact that a certain thing may result
from a given set of circumstances is not sufficient." Therasense, Inc. v.
Becton, Dickinson & Co., 593 F.3d 1325, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citation

omitted). The Examiner has the burden of providing reasonable proof that a
claim limitation is an inherent characteristic of the prior art. In re Best, 562
F.2d 1252, 1254--55 (CCP A 1977). If the Examiner meets this burden, the
burden of proof then shifts to Appellants "to prove that the subject matter
shown to be in the prior art does not possess the characteristic relied on."
Best, 562 F.2d at 1254--55.

Gianotti does not explicitly describe that any of the listed polymers
used to make wires 2, 3 is a shape memory polymer. See Gianotti, col. 4,
11. 55-57. Furthermore, Appellants' Specification does not describe that all
polyethylene and polyurethane materials are shape memory polymers.
Rather, the Specification describes that polyethylene and polyurethane shape
memory polymers can be used in stent 104. Spec. 4, 1. 22-5, 1. 1.
To the extent it is the Examiner's position that all polyethylenes and
polyurethanes presumably exhibit shape memory effects based merely on

4

Appeal2015-000957
Application 13/887,813
their general chemical composition, the Examiner has provided no evidence
that supports that position. To the contrary, Lendein discloses that the shape
memory effect exhibited by shape-memory polymers "results from a
combination of the polymer structure and the polymer morphology together
with the applied processing and programming technology." See Lendlein,
p. 235 (emphasis added). Thus, according to Lendlein, the shape memory
effect is not affiliated merely with composition. The Examiner has not
provided reasonable proof that either polyethylene or polyurethane disclosed
in Gianotti satisfies a combination of the factors described in Lendlein such
that it would necessarily exhibit a shape memory effect. For example,
Gianotti's general disclosure of polyethylene and polyurethane provides no
information about the combination of factors that, according to Lendlein,
would determine whether either polymer exhibits a shape memory effect.
Absent such evidence and reasonable proof, the burden of proof has not been
shifted to Appellants to prove that Gianotti's generally-disclosed
polyethylene and polyurethane are not shape memory polymers. Best, 562
F.2d at 1254--55.
For the above reasons, we do not sustain the rejection of claim 1 and
dependent claims 2--4 as anticipated by Gianotti.
Rejections II-IV
The Examiner's application of Banas to the rejection of claims 5
and 6; Quigley to claims 5, 8, and 9; and Martakos to claim 7, does not cure
the deficiencies of Gianotti for claim 1. See Final Act. 3-5. Accordingly,
we do not sustain the rejections of claims 5 and 6 as unpatentable over
Gianotti and Banas; claims 5, 8, and 9 as unpatentable over Gianotti and
Quigley; and claim 7 as unpatentable over Gianotti and Martakos.
