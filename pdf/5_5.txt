STATEMENT OF THE CASE

Introduction
Appellants' application relates to a flexible memory architecture for
static power reduction in an integrated circuit. Spec. ,-i 1. Claim 1 is
illustrative of the subject matter on appeal and reads as follows with the
disputed limitation italicized:
1.

A memory for an integrated circuit, comprising:
one of:
at least one data input register block and at least one
bit enable input register block, and
at least one data and bit enable merging block and
at least one merged data register block;
one of:
at least one address input register block and at least
one binary to one-hot address decode block, and
at least one binary to one-hot address decode block
and at least one one-hot address register block; and

a memory array whose architecture is modified based on
timing information of any of said blocks.
The Examiner's Rejections
Claims 1and4 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. ยง 102(b) as anticipated
by Murakami et al. (US 7,085, 147 B2; Aug. 1, 2006). Final Act. 2-3.
Claims 2 and 3 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) as
unpatentable over Murakami and Chevallier et al. (US 5,903,504; May 11,
1999). Final Act. 4-5.

ANALYSIS
The Examiner finds Murakami teaches the disputed memory array
limitation. Ans. 4-5, Final Act. 2-3. In particular, the Examiner finds
Murakami discloses conventional CAM systems provide output data directly
to an encoder. Ans. 5 (citing Murakami 8:50-57). The Examiner finds
Murakami discloses an improved CAM system that provides output data to
an output latch, which provides its output to the encoder. Id. (citing
Murakami 9:1-13). The Examiner finds providing the output to a latch
allows the initial data to propagate through the system before the output data
is provided to the encoder. Ans. 4 (citing Murakami 8:8-17). The Examiner
finds this improved CAM array discloses "a memory array whose
architecture is modified based on timing information of any of said blocks,"
as recited in claim 1.
Appellants argue the Examiner erred in finding Murakami discloses
the disputed limitation because !vfurakami does not disclose "that the timing

information in any way modifies the architecture of the CAM array." Br. 5.
Appellants argue "there is no teaching or suggestion in any part of
Murakami that the architecture of CAM array (memory elements 110-112)
can be modified for any reason." Id. Appellants argue Murakami's CAM
array, therefore, is part of a static circuit that latches the lookup result in
every instance, and the architecture is never modified. Br. 6.
Appellants have persuaded us the Examiner erred in finding
Murakami discloses the disputed limitation. As found by the Examiner,
Murakami discloses a CAM array that provides comparison output to a latch
to prevent the output from reaching the encoder before the initial data
propagates through the system. Murakami 8: 8-17, 9: 1-13; Ans. 5.

Appeal2015-002503
Application 12/831,439
However, the Examiner has not established that Murakami discloses a
dynamic memory array architecture that can be modified based on the timing
information of any of the blocks of the circuit. Instead, Murakami discloses
that the memory array is static and always latches the output to account for
the propagation delay. Accordingly, Appellants have persuaded us that the
Examiner has not identified sufficient evidence or provided sufficient
explanation as to how Murakami discloses the disputed limitation.

CONCLUSIONS
On the record before us and in view of the analysis above, Appellants
have persuaded us that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1 as anticipated
by Murakami. Therefore, we do not sustain the rejection of claim 1. We
also do not sustain the rejections of claim 4, which depends therefrom.
Claims 2 and 3, which depend from claim 1, stand rejected as obvious
over ~,.1urakami and Chevallier. The Examiner has not found, nor do \'1/e

find, that Chevallier remedies the identified deficiency in Murakami.
Accordingly, we do not sustain the rejections of claims 2 and 3 as obvious
over Murakami and Chevallier.

DECISION
We reverse the decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1--4.

REVERSED
