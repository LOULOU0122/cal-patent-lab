DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellant appeals under 35 U.S.C. §§ 134 and 306 the Examiner's
decision to reject claims 1-15, 22-29, and 32-37. 1 We have jurisdiction
under 35 U.S.C. §§ 134 and 306.
We affirm.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This proceeding arose from a request for ex parte reexamination filed
on December 12, 2014 of United States Patent 6,493,377 B2 ("the '377
patent"), issued to Schilling et al. on December 10, 2002.
The '377 patent describes a wireless distributed network for reducing
power and power variations when transmitting packets having spreadspectrum modulation. Specifically, the system includes remote stations and
nodes, where a node's spread-spectrum transceiver communicates with the
remote stations over radio waves. See generally Abstract; col. 2, 1. 20 - col.
3, 1. 22. Claim 1 is illustrative of the invention and is reproduced below:
1.
A distributed network, spread-spectrum system,
compnsmg:
a plurality of remote stations;
a plurality of fixed nodes forming the distributed network
for covering a particular geographic area, the plurality of fixed

Although Appellant indicates that claims 1--4, 10, 22, and 28-3 7 stand
finally rejected, the Examiner nevertheless indicates that claims 1-15, 2229, and 32-37 are finally rejected. Compare App. Br. 2 with Final Act. 1, 8;
Ans. 2. Because the Examiner does not indicate that any ground of rejection
is withdrawn and reiterates on page 2 of the Answer that claims 1-15, 2229, and 32-37 are rejected, we presume that these claims are so rejected.

nodes including a hub node, each fixed node covering a microcell having a radius less than one mile;
each fixed node including, a plurality of spread-spectrum
transceivers for communicating, using packets having spreadspectrum modulation, over radio waves, with the plurality of
remote stations, each packet having a source address and a
destination address;
a particular remote station of the plurality of remote
stations being capable of accessing, using radio waves, a first
fixed node in the distributed network, employing traffic
information sent by the first fixed node, and sending one or
more packets to the first fixed node thereby using minimum
power;
a store-and-forward subsystem, coupled to the spreadspectrum transceiver, for storing and forwarding one or more
packets to and from the remote station, and for storing and
forwarding the one or more packets to and from another fixed
node in the plurality of fixed nodes;
a flow-control subsystem, coupled to the store-andfof'l{ard subsystem, for controlling the store-and-fof'l{ard
subsystem, to store each packet arriving at the spread-spectrum
transceivers, said flow-control subsystem communicating
traffic information between each of the fixed nodes in the
plurality of fixed nodes, with the traffic information including
traffic density at each of the nodes, said flow-control
subsystem, responsive to the traffic information and to a packet
having the destination address to the hub node, for routing the
packet through appropriate nodes to the hub node, said flowcontrol subsystem, responsive to the traffic at each fixed node,
each packet having a destination address to a first recipient
node, for transmitting the packet from the hub node to an
appropriate node, routing the pack.et to the first recipient node,
said flow-control subsystem, responsive to the traffic
congestion and to a plurality of packets having voice data, for
routing the plurality of packets through a path in the plurality of

3

Patent US 6,493,377 B2
fixed nodes to ensure that the plurality of packets arrive
sequentially; and
said hub node, responsive to an information packet
arriving from a central office, for routing the information packet
to a second recipient node.
RELATED PROCEEDINGS
This appeal is said to be related to various proceedings. First, on page
1 of the Appeal Brief, Appellant informs us of two civil proceedings and an

ex parte reexamination proceeding (Control No. 90/013,627) for U.S. Patent
7, 176,503 B2 which is a continuation of the '377 patent as noted on page 13
of the Brief. No decision has been rendered in the '62 7 appeal.
On page 15 of the Appeal Brief, Appellant also refers to three other
related ex parte reexamination proceedings, namely Control Numbers
90/013,002 ("'002 proceeding"); 90/013,001 ("'001 proceeding"); and
90/013;400 ("'400 proceeding"). The '002 proceeding involves the '377
patent, and the latter two proceedings involve the '503 patent. App. Br. 15.
Reexamination certificates have issued in these three proceedings.

THE REJECTION
The Examiner rejected claims 1-15, 22-29, and 32-37 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over RICOCHET TECHNOLOGY

784--92 (1999) ("Pursley 2"). 2 Final Act. 8-56. 3

SUBSTANTIAL NEW QUESTION OF PATENTABILITY (SNQ)
In the Reply Brief, Appellant argues that an SNQ was not raised in
this proceeding because, among other things, Ricochet was cited as a
primary reference in the '400 proceeding along with Kahn and Young, and
Ricochet was found to not use traffic information at nodes to route signals
through the system. Reply Br. 2-5, 33-34. Appellant further contends that
no SNQ exists because the prior art of record in the '002 proceeding was
found to not anticipate the two node-based limitations noted on page 11 of
the Reply Brief, and that ostensibly no prior art added in this proceeding
contributes any information sufficient to modify these earlier findings. Id. at
11-12. Moreover, Appellant argues that because points were made in the
'001 proceeding that the cited references did not disclose plural transceivers
at each node, there is allegedly no SNQ in this proceeding. Id. at 27-28.
Appellant adds that because the point was made in the '002 proceeding that
none of the cited references accessed and selected a neighboring node based
on traffic information as claimed, there is allegedly no SNQ in this
proceeding. Id. at 31-32.

Although another reference to Pursley ("Pursley 1") is cited in this
proceeding (Ans. 2), only Pursley 2 is cited in the rejection.

Throughout this opinion, we refer (1) the Final Rejection mailed October
16, 2015 ("Final Act."); (2) the Appeal Brief filed March 28, 2016 ("App.
Br."); (3) the Examiner's Answer mailed May 4, 2016 ("Ans."); and (4) the
Reply Brief filed July 5, 2016 ("Reply Br.").
5

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
These arguments are unavailing. First, Appellant's SNQ arguments
are raised for the first time in the Reply Brief and are, therefore, deemed to
be waived as untimely. Under 37 C.F.R. § 41.41(b)(2), 4 we do not consider
any argument raised in the Reply Brief which ( 1) was not raised in the
Appeal Brief, or (2) is not responsive to an argument raised in the
Examiner's Answer, unless good cause is shown-an exception that is
inapplicable here. Therefore, Appellant's SNQ arguments are improper for
that reason alone.
Second, MPEP § 22 74(VI) requires that Appellant request
reconsideration of the SNQ issue before the Examiner before we can review
that issue-a requirement that has not been satisfied here. Although this
section provides two non-limiting examples of when this reconsideration can
be requested, namely in a patent owner's statement or response under 37
C.F.R. §§ 1.530 and 1.111, respectively, this request must be nevertheless
made before the Appeal Brief. See§ 2274(VI) (requiring that a patent
owner first request consideration before the Examiner, and then seek review
of the Examiner's SNQ determination before the Board); see also id.
(requiring a patent owner identify in its Appeal Brief the communication in
which the owner first requested reconsideration of the SNQ before the
Examiner). Therefore, even if Appellant's Appeal Brief raised the SNQ
issue for the first time in this proceeding-which it does not because this

4

This rule applies to this ex parte reexamination appeal as well as ex parte
appeals. See MANUAL OF PATENT EXAMINING PROCEDURE (MPEP) § 2273
(9th ed. Rev. 07.2015, Nov. 2015).
6

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
issue was raised for the first time in the Reply Brief-such an argument
would still be untimely and, therefore, not before us.
That is not to say, however, that despite an Appellant's not complying
with the procedural mandates of MPEP § 2274(VI), the Board cannot review
the Examiner's SNQ determination that is so facially improper that no
reasonable mind could accept it such that there is no substantial evidence to
support the determination. See In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1312 (Fed.
Cir. 2000). One such circumstance would be when it is indisputably clear
from the record that a patentability question deemed as an SNQ was already
decided in the original examination, for no procedural rule can enable
reexamination under those circumstances. See In re Recreative
Technologies Corp., 83 F.3d 1394, 1396-98 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
But that is not the case here. Although there is some overlap in the
references cited in the above-noted reexamination proceedings identified in
the Reply Brief that are said to preclude an SNQ (see Reply Br. 2-5, 11-12,
27-28, 31-34), the rejections are not the same, for they involve different
claims, and rely on different evidence, findings, and conclusions. Moreover,
these rejections are based on different combinations of prior art referencesa distinction that further establishes that these rejections constitute different
grounds of rejection despite citing identical references. See In re McDaniel,
293 F.3d 1379, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (noting that obviousness rejection that
added a prior art reference (Grot) to a combination of other prior art
references did not share a common ground of rejection with claims rejected
as obvious over those other references).

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
As the Examiner explained during prosecution, the Ricochet reference
is presented in a new light in this proceeding, namely with respect to nodes
in a distributed network that ( 1) cover a microcell having a radius of less
than one mile, and (2) transmit traffic information allowing a remote station
to access a first node in a distributed network using minimum power. See
Office Action Ordering Reexamination 13-15 (mailed Feb. 12, 2015).
Because of these new and non-cumulative teachings, as well as those in
various other cited prior art references, an SNQ was deemed to be raised
and, therefore, reexamination was ordered. Id. at 7-16. On this record, we
see no error in these findings and conclusions.
Accordingly, we are unpersuaded of error in the Examiner's SNQ
determination even if the issue was before us-which it is not.

THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION
The Examiner finds that Ricochet discloses many recited elements of
claim 1 except for (1) each fixed node including plural transceivers, and (2)
each packet having a source and destination address, but cites Young and
Kahn, respectively, for teaching these features. Final Act. 8-13. The
Examiner also cites Pursley 2 for teaching that ( 1) traffic information
includes traffic density, and (2) packets carry voice traffic. Id. at 12-13.
Based on these collective teachings, the Examiner concludes that the claim
would have been obvious. Id. at 8-13.
Appellant argues that the cited prior art does not disclose the recited
distributed network spread-spectrum system that uses plural spread-spectrum
transceivers at each fixed node as claimed. App. Br. 16. According to

8

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
Appellant, skilled artisans would not have combined the cited references as
the Examiner proposes because (1) the goals of those references and the
'377 patent differ; (2) the proposed combination requires redesigning
Ricochet's system, thus greatly impacting Ricochet's principle of operation;
and (3) the cited references are non-analogous art. App. Br. 16-44; Reply
Br. 5-33.

ISSUES
(1) Under§ 103, has the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1 by
finding that Ricochet, Young, Kahn, and Pursley 2 collectively would have
taught or suggested a distributed network spread-spectrum system where
each fixed node includes plural spread-spectrum transceivers?
(2) Is the Examiner's proposed combination of these references
supported by articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to
justify the Examiner's obviousness conclusion? This issue turns on whether
the proposed combination would destroy Ricochet' s principle of operation,
and whether the cited references constitute analogous art.

ANALYSIS
We begin by noting that this dispute involving the Examiner's
obviousness rejection turns solely on the two issues presented in our issue
statement. As indicated previously, in addition to Appellant's combinability
arguments, only one limitation was contested in the Appeal Brief, namely
that each fixed node includes plural spread-spectrum transceivers. See App.
Br. 16. Accord Ans. 3--4 (responding to this argument). Accordingly,

9

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
Appellant's arguments presented for the first time in the Reply Brief that the
cited references allegedly fail to show a different limitation, namely a remote
station that can select and access a first fixed node based on traffic
information (Reply Br. 11, 32), are deemed to be waived as untimely and
are, therefore, not before us. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.41(b)(2).
Turning to the rejection, the Examiner acknowledges that Ricochet's
distributed network spread-spectrum system includes a single transceiver at
each fixed node, but lacks plural transceivers at each fixed node. Final Act.
9; Ans. 3. To cure this deficiency, the Examiner cites Young's teaching of
using radios with multiple transmitters and receivers, including transceivers.
Final Act. 9 (citing Young, col. 2, 11. 22-25); Ans. 3--4. In light of this
teaching, the Examiner concludes that providing plural transceivers in lieu of
a single transceiver at a fixed node in Ricochet would have been obvious to,
among other things, increase the number of communications channels-a
fact further evidenced by the Matsumoto reference. Ans. 4--5. 5
We see no error in this position. Ricochet's spread-spectrum, packetswitching system uses a mesh architecture where radio transceivers, called
"Microcell Radios," are typically mounted on street lights or utility poles,
and placed every quarter to half mile in a checkerboard pattern. Ricochet,
E4, E25. 6 Notably, each radio employs 162 channels---each of which is 160
kHz wide---over which transmissions are "spread." Id.

5

Although this reference was not cited in the rejection, it is nonetheless
cited as evidence of knowledge within the level of ordinary skill in art at the
time of the invention. Ans. 4.
6
Although the Ricochet reference consists of various exhibits labeled
"B5.1" to "B5.9," the reference is paginated consecutively from pages "El"
10

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
Given this limited number of channels for a particular transceiver, we
see no reason why additional transceivers could not be provided in Ricochet
as the Examiner proposes to, among other things, expand the number of
channels, particularly given Young's teaching in column 2, lines 25 and 26
that radios containing multiple transmitters and receivers were known in the
art. Even assuming, without deciding, that Young does not mention these
multi-transceiver radios again either in the cited reference or in later patents
as Appellant contends (Reply Br. 16, 21 ), such silence does not obviate the
fact that the reference nevertheless teaches that multi-transceiver radios are
known in the art, even if this teaching appears only once in the reference.
And even assuming, without deciding, that Young does not enable any
disclosed embodiment using multiple transmitters as Appellant contends (id.
at 17-19), that alone is not dispositive, for it is well settled that published
subject matter is prior art for all that it teaches in obviousness
determinations---even if the reference itself is not enabling. See In re Antor

Media Corp., 689 F.3d 1282, 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Symbol Techs.
Inc. v. Opticon Inc., 935 F.2d 1569, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). In any event, a
reference's teachings are not considered in a vacuum, but rather considered
together with the knowledge of ordinarily skilled artisans. See In re

Paulsen, 30 F.3d 1475, 1480-81 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Cited references, then, do
not have to explain every detail to render a claimed invention obvious since
the reference is speaking to those skilled in the art. Id. at 1480.

to "E27." For clarity, we refer to Ricochet's pages consistent with this
numbering scheme.
11

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
Here, we see no error in the Examiner's reliance on Young for the
limited purpose for which it was cited, namely that radios containing
multiple transceivers were known in the art, and that providing multiple
transceivers in lieu of a single transceiver in each of Ricochet's fixed nodes
would have been obvious to, among other things, increase the number of
channels-a predictable result. Ans. 4--5. Appellant's arguments regarding
Young's individual shortcomings in this regard (see Reply Br. 15-21) do not
show nonobviousness where, as here, the rejection is based on the cited
references' collective teachings. See In re Merck & Co., Inc., 800 F.2d
1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986). That Young may not pertain to spreadspectrum systems as Appellant contends (Reply Br. 33) is of no consequence
here given the limited purpose for which Young was cited, namely to show
that radios containing multiple transceivers were known in the art, and that
providing known multi-transceiver radios in lieu of single-transceiver radios
in Ricochet's spread-spectrum system would have been obvious. Ans. 4--5.
Nor are we persuaded that the proposed combination would destroy
Ricochet's principle of operation as Appellant contends (App. Br. 16-17), or
otherwise render Ricochet unsuitable for its intended purpose. See In re
Gordon, 733 F.2d 900, 902 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Appellant contrasts Ricochet's

concatenating the path from the source to the destination via a central
"Name Server" with Young's establishing a single direct path at each node
to prevent interference. App. Br. 16-17. Appellant also asserts that
Ricochet' s terminals access multiple fixed nodes, but Young's terminals are
co-located and mobile. Id. at 17. Based on these differences, Appellants

12

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
reason that the proposed combination would eliminate Ricochet's core
function where terminals and nodes are separate entities. Id.
But as the Examiner indicates, the Examiner does not propose to
physically combine Ricochet's nodes with those of Young, but rather merely
relies on Young for a limited purpose, namely to show that radios containing
multiple transceivers were known in the art, and that providing known multitransceiver radios in Ricochet' s spread-spectrum system would have been
obvious. Ans. 4--5. It is well settled that "a determination of obviousness
based on teachings from multiple references does not require an actual,
physical substitution of elements." In re Mouttet, 686 F.3d 1322, 1332 (Fed.
Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). Nor is the test for obviousness whether a
secondary reference's features can be bodily incorporated into the structure
of the primary reference. In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425 (CCPA 1981).
Rather, the test is what the combined teachings of the references would have
suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. Id. And here, the Examiner's
proposed combination predictably uses prior art elements according to their
established functions to yield a predictable result. See KSR Int 'l Co. v.

Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 417 (2007).
Lastly, we see no error in the Examiner's findings that the cited
references constitute analogous art. Prior art is analogous if it is ( 1) from the
same field of endeavor as that of Appellant's invention regardless of the
problem addressed, or (2) reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with
which the inventor is involved. In re Bigio, 381F.3d1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir.
2004 ). Here, the Examiner finds that the cited references are in the same
field of endeavor because each cited reference relates to (1) wireless

13

Appeal2016-007605
Reexamination Control 90/013 ,418
Patent US 6,493,377 B2
communication in a distributed network of nodes, and (2) transmission of
packets over the network. Ans. 5-7. The Examiner also finds that the cited
references are reasonably pertinent to Appellant's problems pertaining to (1)
reducing power levels; (2) increasing network capacity; and (3) creating a
flexible and dynamically adaptable network. Id. at 7-10. Despite
Appellant's arguments to the contrary (App. Br. 17--44; Reply Br. 7-11),
Appellant does not persuasively rebut the Examiner's findings in this regard
(Ans. 5-10) which we adopt as our own.
Therefore, we are not persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claim 1, and claims 2-15, 22-29, and 32-37 not argued separately with
particularity.

CONCLUSION
The Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 1-15, 22-29, and 32-37
under§ 103.

DECISION
The Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1-15, 22-29, and 32-37 is
affirmed.
