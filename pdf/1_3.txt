Before JASON V. MORGAN, MELISSA A. RAAP ALA, and
NABEEL U. KHAN, Administrative Patent Judges.
RAAP ALA, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is a decision on appeal under 35 U.S.C. ยง 134(a) from a final
rejection of claims 1-24.
We have reviewed Appellants' contentions in the Briefs, the
Examiner's rejection and the Examiner's response to Appellants'
contentions. We concur with Appellants' conclusion that the Examiner fails
to establish the combination of Eddings (US 7, 788,245 B 1; Aug. 31, 2010)
and Bowden (US 2007/0073704 Al; March 29, 2007) teaches or suggests a
uniform resource locator (URL) to the ML document with an appended page

Appeal2015-003201

anchor that comprises a text identifier of a markup language tag located
within the ML document proximate to the location of a search term within
the ML document ("URL limitation"), as recited in independent claims 1, 9,

and 17.
The Examiner relies on Eddings to teachings the URL limitation.
Final Act. 3; see also Ans. 6. As correctly identified by Appellants (App.
Br. 16-18), Eddings describes embedding of a search-engine URL into a
"href' tag of a document to obtain search results for the search term (e.g.,
"golden retriever"). See Eddings col. 10, 1. 55---col. 11, 1. 35. We agree with
Appellants that an embedded link to invoke a search engine to search for a
specified term (e.g., a link to www.google.com to search for the term
"golden retriever") is not a URL to a ML document with an appended page
anchor.
Appellants persuade us the Examiner has not established the
combination of Eddings and Bowden teaches or suggests the URL
limitation. The Examiner has not found the additional reference of record,
Jensen, teaches or suggests this limitation. Accordingly, we will not sustain
the 35 U.S.C. ยง 103(a) rejections of independent claims 1, 9, and 17 and the
remaining claims, which depend directly or indirectly from one of claims 1,
9, and 17. 1

We do not reach the additional contentions presented by Appellants
because the identified issue is dispositive of the appeal.
