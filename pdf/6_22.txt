This Appeal is related to Appeal Number 2014-008941.

Appeal2014-009098
Application 12/207,984
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to a wound closure device and method. Claim
56, reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:
A method of bonding tissue, comprising:
placing a single strip of flexible material over a section of
tissue, wherein said flexible material comprises a polymerization
initiator or rate modifier disposed in or on said flexible material,
and an adhesive substance disposed on at least a portion of a
bottom side of said flexible material;
applying a polymerizable adhesive composition over and
fully covering a top surface of the single strip of flexible
material; and
allowing the polymerizable adhesive composition to
permeate into and under the flexible material and polymerize to
form a composite structure bonded to said tissue.
56.

OPINION
Regarding the proposed combination of Lutri with Narang, the
Examiner concludes:
It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at
the time of the invention to modify the flexible material of Lutri
with a polymerization rate modifier and the polymerizable
adhesive as taught by Narang. The motivation is to "provide a
desired medical or therapeutic activity as well as enhancing
polymerization of the adhesive" (Narang Abstract).

Final Act. 6 (emphasis omitted); see also Ans. 2-3, 4.
Appellants argue that "the Examiner has not provided the motivation
for one of skill in the art to apply a polymerization initiator or rate modifier
first to a 'flexible material ... wherein a polymerization initiator or rate
modifier is disposed in or on said flexible material.'" App. Br. 7.
We agree with Appellants. As a reason for combing the teachings of
Lutri and Narang, the Examiner merely identifies in Narang a wound closure
method that employs a polymerization rate modifier with a polymerizable
adhesive whereby the polymerization rate modifier enhances polymerization
of the adhesive. Although the Examiner notes the advantage provided by a
polymerization initiator or rate modifier, the Examiner does not articulate
any reason or motivation to dispose a polymerization rate modifier in or on
the flexible material of Lutri. Lacking the requisite "articulated reasoning
with some rational underpinnings" (see In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed.
Cir. 2006), cited with approval in KSR Int 'l. v. Teleflex, 550 U.S. 398, 418
(2007)), we cannot sustain the Examiner's rejection of independent claims
56 and 71 or dependent claims 58---62, 64---69, 73-75, and 77 as unpatentable
over Lutri and Narang.

Application 12/207,984
Further, the Examiner does not rely on Edenbaum in any way that
would cure the deficiency in the Examiner's rejection based on Lutri and
Narang. As such, we do not sustain the rejection of claims 63 and 70 as
unpatentable over Lutri, Narang, and Edenbaum.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejections of claims 56, 58-71, 73-75, and 77 are
reversed.

REVERSED
