Claimed Subject Matter

Claim 58, reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject
matter:
58.

A closure device comprising:
only one circumferential frame defining a single frame

plane;
a first crossbar extending across the frame, the first
crossbar having a central portion and terminal crossbar ends
connectively linked to separate sites on the frame;
a bar-shaped first anchor containing two terminal first
anchor ends and a central portion attached to the central portion
of the first cross bar; and
a single sheet of biocompatible material, the sheet of
biocompatible material having a periphery attached to the frame,
wherein each of the frame, the first crossbar, and the first
anchor comprises at least one flexible, substantially linear
structure,
wherein the first anchor is only indirectly connected to the
frame via the first crossbar and
wherein the first crossbar is configured to extend in an arc
concave to the frame plane when deployed, and wherein the first
anchor is configured to extend in an arc convex to the frame
plane when deployed.

ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejections in light of Appellants'
arguments (App. Br. 5-9; see also Reply Br. 2-3). We concur with
Appellants' argument (App. Br. 6, 8) that independent claims 58, 70, and 74
each limit the number of frames to one, and that Marino '548 discloses
closure devices with two frames.
The Examiner concludes that, because claim 58 uses the open-ended
transitional phrase "comprising," "claim 58 may be interpreted as being
inclusive of an additional, unrecited delivery bar structure (48; see Marino,
Fig. 3a above)." Ans. 4. Although the Examiner is correct that the
transitional phrase "comprising" allows the claims to encompass a device
with additional structures not recited in the claim, "' [c]omprising' is not a
weasel word with which to abrogate claim limitations." Spectrum Int 'l, Inc.
v. Sterilite Corp., 164 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Here, the

independent claims are specifically limited to "only one circumferential
frame" (claims 58 and 74) and "only one frame" (claim 70), and we do not
interpret the transitional phrase "comprising" to reach into each limitation of
the claims to broaden the scope of each limitation. For example, we decline
to allow the term "comprising" to reach into the limitation "only one frame"
such that the limitation is met by prior art having closure devices with more
than one frame. See Dippin 'Dots, Inc. v. Mosey, 476 F.3d 1337, 1343 (Fed.
Cir. 2007) ("The presumption raised by the term 'comprising' does not reach

Appeal2015-000159
Application 12/533,731
into each of the six steps to render every word and phrase therein openended---especially where, as here, the patentee has narrowly defined the
claim term it now seeks to have broadened.").
Appellants' Specification indicates that a frame must support a sheet
of biocompatible material and be used to cover a septal opening, such as a
patent foramen ovale (PFO). Spec. i-f 77. Both of Marino '548's hoops 46
and 48 are covered with sheets of material and cover the septal opening. See
Marino '548 Fig. 3a, i-fi-146-47. Indeed, Figures 1-3 of Marino '548 do not
show any differences between hoop 48, which the Examiner calls an
additional "delivery bar structure," and hoop 46, which the Examiner
identifies as the claimed "frame." Ans. 3. Thus, hoop 46 must be
considered an additional frame rather than an additional structure of the
closure device not recited in the claim. Because claims 58, 70, and 74 are
limited to only one frame, the Examiner's rejections of these claims are in
error. Accordingly, we do not sustain the rejection of claims 58 and 74 as
anticipated by Marino '548 and the rejection of claim 70 as obvious over
Marino '548 and Marino '907.
The rejections of the dependent claims rely on the Examiner's finding
that Marino '548 discloses "only one circumferential frame" as recited in
independent claims 58 and 74, and teaches "only one frame" as recited in
independent claim 70. Final Act. 4--9. Thus, for the same reasons as the
independent claims, we do not sustain the rejections of dependent claims
59---61, 63---69, 71-73, and 75.
