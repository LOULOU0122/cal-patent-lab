DECISION ON APPEAL

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
rejection of claims 1--4, 6-12, 14--21, 25, and 26. We have jurisdiction
under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

Our decision references Appellants' Specification ("Spec.," filed June 4,
2012), Appeal Brief ("Appeal Br.," filed Sept. 16, 2013), and Reply Brief
"Reply Br.' filed May 23, 2014), as well as the Final Office Action ("Final
Action," mailed July 19, 2013) and the Examiner's Answer ("Answer,"
mailed April 16, 2014).

Appellants identify the Raymond Corporation as the real party in interest.
Appeal Br. 1.

Appeal2014-006834
Application 13/487,789
According to Appellants, their invention relates "to a system for
sensing performance characteristics of an industrial vehicle[,] and using
those characteristics to manage the operation of the vehicle." Spec. i-f 2.
Independent claims 1 and 16 are the only independent claims under
appeal. See Appeal Br., Claims App. We reproduce independent claim 1,
below, as representative of the appealed claims.
A method for controlling an industrial vehicle that
carries a plurality of loads on which indicators have been placed,
said method comprising:
1.

creating a computer implemented database that designates
load identifiers which are associated with loads that are fragile;
electronically reading a given indicator on a load being
carried by the industrial vehicle to obtain a given load identifier;
employing the given load identifier to obtain data from the
database wherein that data indicates whether the load being
carried requires delicate handling; and
in response to data obtained from the database, restricting
operation of the industrial vehicle to provide delicate handling of
the load.
Id.
REJECTION AND PRIOR ART 3
The Examiner rejects claims 1--4, 6-12, 14--21, 25, and 26 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Manthey (US 2007/0007080 Al,
pub. Jan. 11, 2007) and Horwitz (US 6,496,806 B 1, iss. Dec. 17, 2002).
See Final Action 2-9.

In an Advisory Action mailed September 11, 2013, the Examiner
withdraws the indefiniteness rejection included on page 2 of the Final
Action.

Application 13/487,789
ANALYSIS
The Examiner rejects independent claim 1 based on a combination of
Manthey and Horwitz. See Final Action 2-3. Appellants argue that the
rejection is in error because "Horwitz is non-analogous to the present
invention and to the Manthey system." Appeal Br. 6; see also id. at 6-8; see

also Reply Br. 1-2. Based on our review of the record, we determine that
Appellants fail to persuade us that Horwitz is non-analogous art.
A reference is analogous art to the claimed invention if either (1) the
reference is from the same field of endeavor as the claimed invention (even
if it addresses a different problem), or (2) the reference is reasonably
pertinent to the problem faced by the inventor (even if it is not in the same
field of endeavor as the claimed invention). See In re Bigio, 381F.3d1320,
1325 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Consistent with the preamble of claim 1, the claimed
field of endeavor appears to be "[a] method for controlling an industrial
vehicle that carries a plurality of loads on which indicators have been
placed." Appeal Br., Claims App. While the Examiner's determination that
"in this case, the field of endeavor is data management" may be unduly
broad, we determine that Horwitz describes controlling an industrial vehicle
that carries a plurality of loads on which indicators have been placed, such
that Horwitz is in the same field of endeavor as the claimed invention.
Answer 3. Thus, we are not persuaded of error by this argument.
Appellants further argue that "even combining the Manthey and
Horwitz teachings does not suggest the claimed method." Appeal Br. 6; see

also id. at 8-11; see also Reply Br. 1-2. We disagree with Appellants. The
Examiner's combination relies on findings that Manthey discloses almost
every limitation of claim 1, except Manthey employs an identifier to obtain
3

Appeal2014-006834
Application 13/487,789
data from an RFID transponder, rather than a database as claimed. See Final
Action 3. The Examiner finds that Horwitz discloses a similar arrangement
as Manthey, and employs an identifier to obtain data from a database. See
id. The Examiner concludes that "[i]t would have been obvious ... to

provide the method of Manthey with the database means as taught by
Horwitz in order to locate data centrally." Id. Each of the Examiner's
findings and conclusion is reasonable. Thus, we agree with the Examiner
that the claim is obvious.
Appellants' specific arguments do not persuade us of error. See
Appeal Br. 8-11. For example, we are not persuaded of error by Appellants'
argument that "[Horwitz's] database does not store data about physical
characteristics of the objects or specifically that an item is delicate requiring
special handling," inasmuch as the Examiner's proposed combination of
references would store Manthey's information in Horwitz's database. See
Appeal Br. 8; see Final Action 3. Similarly, we are not persuaded of error
by Appellants' argument that
the information retrieved from the Horwitz database is only used
by the warehouse order tracking computer and is not
communicated back to the vehicle. Note in particular that the
device 118 on the forklift is referred to only as transmitter, not a
receiver or transceiver as would be required in order to have the
database information sent to the forklift. In other words, just like
the ID tag interrogators 126 along the conveyor belts 124 in this
reference, information about the items being transported is only
sent one way[-]to the database computer. Item related
information is not sent from the database to the forklift. That is
consistent with the essence of the Horwitz system[-]tracking
the location and the processing of items in the warehouse
Appeal Br. 9. As the Examiner finds, Horwitz discloses two-way
communication. See Answer 4--5.

Appeal2014-006834
Application 13/487,789
For the above reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 1. Inasmuch
as Appellants argue claims 1 and 16 together and not under separate
headings, claim 16 falls with claim 1. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37 (c)(l)(iv).
Further, Appellants do not separately argue dependent claims 2--4, 6-8, 11,
12, 14, 15, and 17-21. Thus, these dependent claims also fall with claims 1
and 16, and, thus, we sustain the rejection of claims 2--4, 6-8, 11, 12, 14, 15,
and 17-21.
Appellants separately argue the patentability of claims 9, 10, 25,
and 26. See Appeal Br. 11. Specifically, Appellants argue that
[c]laims 9, 10, 25[,] and 26 recite electrically detecting when the
given load is no longer being carried by the vehicle and then
terminating the restricted operation of the vehicle. Claims 10 and
26 further state that detecting when the given load is no longer
being carried comprises sensing a force applied to a component
of the industrial vehicle. Nothing in Manthey describes how its
reduced operation is terminated, much less that termination is in
response to sensing a force. The final rejection of claims 9 and
25 cited paragraph 0023 in Manthey; which merely describes
how the communication device 15 that reads the RFID
transponders can be activated and deactivated based on changes
in the weight of the load. This merely indicates how reading the
load data can be turned on and off, but does not in the least
suggest how the restricted operation of the vehicle can be
terminated. Furthermore, nothing in Horwitz restricts operation
of the vehicle.
Appeal Br. 11. We agree with the Examiner, however, that Appellants'
argument exceeds the scope of the claim---claim 9 recites, for example,
"electrically detecting when the given load no longer is being carried by the
industrial vehicle; and terminating the restricting operation of the industrial
vehicle." Appeal Br., Claims App. Importantly, claim 9 does not require
terminating operation in response to "electrically detecting when the given
5

Appeal2014-006834
Application 13/487,789
load no longer is being carried." We determine that the Examiner's further
findings and conclusions with respect to at least claim 9 are reasonable. See
Answer 6; see Final Action 5. Further, inasmuch as Appellants argue all of
these claims together and not under separate headings, claims 10, 25, and 26
fall with claim 9. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37 (c)(l)(iv).

DECISION
We AFFIRM the Examiner's obviousness rejection of claims 1--4, 612, 14--21, 25, and 26.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
