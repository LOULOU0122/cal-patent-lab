Before LARRY J. HUME, LINZY T. McCARTNEY, and JOYCE CRAIG,
Administrative Patent Judges.

McCARTNEY, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellant appeals under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from a rejection of claims
1-14. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b ).

We AFFIRM.

Application 12/701,823
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The present patent application concerns "a method and a system for
scheduling a manufacturing process planned by an Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) and produced by equipment of a shop floor, wherein within
a Manufacturing Executing System (MES) a production scheduler is
provided to schedule tasks of the manufacturing process." Spec. i-f 3. Claim
1 illustrates the claimed subject matter:
1.
A method of scheduling a manufacturing process planned
by an enterprise resource planning and performed by equipment
of a shop floor, wherein a production scheduler within a
manufacturing executing system schedules tasks of the
manufacturing process, the method which comprises the
following steps:
displaying a current production schedule by way of an
interactive Gantt-chart;
displaying in the interactive Gantt-chart for each piece of
equipment of the shop floor time periods already scheduled and
time periods still unscheduled;
with a pointing device, selecting for a specific piece of
equipment, one of the time periods still unscheduled being
displayed on the interactive Gant chart;
querying a production database for the specific piece of
equipment to find at least one task that can be performed by the
specific piece of equipment and that fits into the time period still
unscheduled; and
if a single task is found, scheduling the task, or if a
plurality of tasks are found, scheduling at least one of the
plurality of tasks, by way of a decision entered by a user
interaction or by way of a decision determined automatically by
a selection preference.

REJECTIONS
Claims 1-14 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable
over Baird et al. (US 2007 /0094661 A 1; April 26, 2007), Chua et al. (US
2005/0154625 Al; July 14, 2005), Castellani et al. (US 2002/0077878 Al;
June 20, 2002), Van Den Nieuwelaar et al. (US 2005/0102723 Al; May 12,
2005), and Zhang et al., "Self-Construction Production Scheduling System,"
Proc. of the 2006 IEEE Int'l Conf. on Automation Sci. & Engineering
(2006).
ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejection in light of Appellant's
arguments, and we disagree with Appellant that the Examiner erred.
Appellant has waived arguments Appellant failed to raise or properly
develop in Appellant's briefing. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.41(b)(2).
Appellant argues "Chua et al. would not have suggested modifying
Baird et al. 's method for scheduling a personal or collaborative task to be the
method defined by claim 1." Br. 9. According to Appellant, "Baird et al. are
not in the slightest bit concerned with scheduling a manufacturing process
planned by an enterprise resource planning and performed by equipment of a
shop floor." Id. at 7, 10. Appellant asserts "[i]t would not have been
predictable and therefore, it would not have been obvious to have
incorporated a manufacturing process planned by an enterprise resource
planning and performed by equipment of a shop floor into Baird et al. 's
teaching of scheduling personal or collaborative tasks for members of an
organization." Id. at 10.
We find Appellant's arguments unpersuasive. Appellant's arguments
largely rest on the fact that Baird's "goals do not include scheduling a

3

Appeal2015-007128
Application 12/701,823
manufacturing" as recited in the claims. Id. at 5. But "neither the particular
motivation nor the avowed purpose of the [inventor] controls" an
obviousness analysis. KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 419
(2007). "The use of patents as references is not limited to what the patentees
describe as their own inventions or to the problems with which they are
concerned. They are part of the literature of the art, relevant for all they
contain." In re Heck, 699 F.2d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Here, the
Examiner found one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated
to combine Chua's teachings with Baird's "to improve utilization by
scheduling jobs for execution that are deemed to be best suited based on a
set [of] rules." Final Act. 4--5 (citing Chua Abstract). Appellant's assertion
that Baird is not concerned with scheduling a manufacturing process does
not persuade us that the Examiner erred.
In addition, Appellant has offered little in the way of persuasive
evidence or reasoning to support the contention that the Examiner's
combination of Chua's and Baird's teachings would not have been
predictable. Appellant simply asserts that "it would have not have been
predictable and therefore, it would not have been obvious" to combine
Baird's and Chua's teachings because Baird teaches "scheduling personal or
collaborative task for members of an organization." App. Br. 10. But as
noted by the Examiner, Baird explicitly discloses that Baird's method of
scheduling tasks applies to machines and devices. See Ans. 3; Baird i-f 24.
Appellant has simply failed to adequately explain why the Examiner's
combination of Baird's and Chua's teachings would not have been
predictable. Accordingly, we find this argument unavailing.

4

Appeal2015-007128
Application 12/701,823
Appellant also contends the Examiner has not explained how or why
one of ordinary skill in the art would have combined Baird's and Van Den
Nieuwelaar's respective querying methods to obtain the "querying" step
recited in claim 1. See Br. 11-13. Appellant argues Examiner's "motivation
does not address the established functions of the respective steps of the two
teachings." Id. (emphasis omitted); see also id. at 12. According to
Appellant, it would not have been predictable to combine Van Den
Nieuwelaar's querying method with Baird's querying method, given their
respective established functions. Id. at 13.
We find Appellant's arguments unpersuasive. As an initial matter,
although the Examiner found Baird teaches querying to find a task that fits
into an unscheduled period, the Examiner explicitly found the combination
of Baird, Chua, Zhang, and Castellani does not disclose the "querying" step
recited in claim 1. Final Act. 3, 6. However, the Examiner found Van Den
Nieuwelaar remedies this deficiency. Id. at 6. Thus, contrary to Appellant's
arguments, the Examiner did not find it would have been obvious to
combine the "established functions" of Baird's and Van Den Nieuwelaar's
querying methods. Rather, the Examiner found it would have been obvious
to combine Van Den Nieuwellar' s query with other aspects of Baird, Chua,
Zhang, and Castellani to arrive at the claimed invention.
Even if Appellant were correct that the Examiner combined Baird's
and Van Den Nieuwelaar's querying methods, Appellant's arguments
suggest that one of ordinary skill in the art would have been forced to
mechanically apply Baird's and Van Den Nieuwelaar's respective methods.
But "[a] person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity, not
an automaton." KSR Int 'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 421 (2007).

5

Appeal2015-007128
Application 12/701,823
There is no evidence that combining these querying steps to obtain the
claimed "querying" step would have been "uniquely challenging or difficult
for one of ordinary skill in the art." Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-Price,
Inc., 485 F.3d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2007). And here, too, Appellant fails to

provide persuasive evidence or reasoning that it would not have been
predictable to combine Van Den Nieuwelaar's teachings with Baird's. We
therefore see no reason to disturb the Examiner's rejection on these grounds.
DECISION
For the above reasons, we affirm the rejection of claims 1-14.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
