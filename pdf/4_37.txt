Before KRISTEN L. DROESCH, SCOTT B. HOWARD, and
JOYCE CRAIG, Administrative Patent Judges.
DROESCH, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants seek review under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
final rejection of claims 1, 4-17, and 19-23, which constitute all the claims
pending in this application. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.
BACKGROUND
The disclosed invention relates to dual homing to an access network to
provide connectivity from multiple network switches. Spec. 1-2, Abstract.

Appellants indicate the real party-in-interest is Avaya Inc. App. Br. 2.

Appeal2015-003583
Application 12/907,535
Representative claim 1, reproduced from the Claims Appendix of the Appeal
Brief, reads as follows (disputed limitations in italics):
A method of connecting a network switching device
between a transport network and an access network, the access
network for providing connectivity between the transport
network and end stations coupled to the access network,
compnsmg:
identifying the transport network, the transport network
configured to interconnect a plurality of access networks for
internetwork traffic between the end stations connected to the
access networks;
identifying the switching device, the switching device
coupled to the access network;
defining a partner device, the partner device coupled to
the access network;
configuring a dynamic route between the switching
device and an origin device in the transport network, the origin
device also coupled to the partner device, the partner device
sharing the dynamic route with the switching device; and
maintaining connectivity, via the dynamic route, from the
origin device to the access network via at least one of the
switching device and the partner device, independently of
failure of either the switching device or the partner device, or
failure of a link to the switching device or the partner device;
configuring a first static route to the access network
between the switching device and the origin device; and
configuring a second static route to the access network
between the partner device and the origin device; and
avoiding redundant routing entries to the access network
through both the switching device and the partner device by
maintaining separate entries for the first static route, the
second static route and the dynamic route.

REJECTION
Claims 1, 4--17, and 19-23 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Sajassi et al. (US 2009/0144403 Al; published June 4,

Appeal2015-003583
Application 12/907,535
2009) ("Sajassi") and Allan et al. (US 2010/0103813 Al; published Apr. 29,
2010) ("Allan").
ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejection in light of Appellants'
arguments in the Appeal Brief2, the Examiner's Answer, and the arguments
in the Reply Brief. We disagree with Appellants' conclusions, and agree
with, and adopt as our own, the Examiner's findings and conclusions of law
to the extent they are consistent with our below analysis. Specific findings
and arguments are highlighted and addressed below for emphasis.
Appellants argue that Sajassi and Allan do not teach or suggest
configuring a first static route to the access network between
the switching device and the origin device; and configuring a
second static route to the access network between the partner
device and the origin device; and avoiding redundant routing
entries to the access network through both the switching device
and the partner device by maintaining separate entries for the
first static route, the second static route and the dynamic route,
as recited in claim 1. See App. Br. 12-13. Appellants contend Sajassi fails
to show first and second static routes along with a dynamic route, and
separate entries are used for the first static route, the second static route and
the dynamic route to avoid redundant routing entries. See id. at 13.
Appellants further contend Allan fails to disclose a second static route
between the partner device and the origin device, a static route between the
switching device, the origin device and the partner device that is coupled to
the origin device, and a separate entry for each of the three routes. See id.
Appellants' arguments are not persuasive of error because Appellants'
arguments address the teachings of Sajassi alone and Allan alone. One

Appeal2015-003583
Application 12/907,535
cannot show non-obviousness by analyzing a reference individually, as
Appellants have done here, where the rejection is based on a combination of
references. See In re Merck & Co., Inc., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir.
1986). The Examiner relies on the combined teachings of Sajassi and Allan
to teach or suggest the disputed limitations. See Final Act. 4---6.
Specifically, the Examiner relies on Sajassi for teaching configuring a
standby route between the switching device (i.e., power edge bridging
device 18) and an origin device (i.e., provider edge bridging device 28), the
origin device also coupled to the partner device, the partner device sharing
the standby route with the switching device; configuring a first active route
between the switching device and the origin device, and configuring a
second active route between the partner device (i.e., provider edge bridging
device 20) and the origin device (see Final Act. 3--4 (citing Sajassi i-f 16,
Figs. 1, 7) ), as modified by Allan's teachings of dynamic routes, static
routes, and avoiding redundant routing entries through two devices by
maintaining separate entries for the first static route, second static route and
dynamic route (see Final Act. 5 (citing Allan i-fi-112, 17-19, 21-24)). We
also are not persuaded by Appellants' argument that "the Sajassi and Allan
reference[s] do not anticipate the claimed subject matter," addressing the
Examiner's rejection based on obviousness. See App. Br. 15.
In the Reply Brief, Appellants argue that Sajassi fails to show the
origin device (28) is also coupled to the partner device (20) and wherein the
partner device (20) shares the dynamic route with the switching device (18).
See Reply Br. 3--4 (citing Ans. 17, 19). Appellants contend Figure 1 of

Appellants' Specification depicts dynamic route 114 shared between BEB
130-1 and BEB 130-2, and the dynamic route extends to BEB 130-3. See
Reply Br. 3. Appellants contend the configuration of Appellants' Figure 1 is

Appeal2015-003583
Application 12/907,535
not described or suggested by either Sajassi or Allan alone, or in
combination. See id. at 3.
Appellants' aforementioned arguments are presented for the first time
in the Reply Brief and are not responsive to an argument raised for the first
time in the Answer. The Examiner's mapping of the claimed origin device
to Sajassi's provider edge bridging device 28, the claimed partner device to
Sajassi's provider edge bridging device 20, and the claimed switching device
to Sajassi's power edge bridging device 18, and finding that Sajassi teaches
or suggests the disputed claim limitations are consistent between the Final
Action and the Answer. Compare Final Act. 3--4, with Ans. 15-19.
Arguments raised for the first time in the Reply Brief are deemed waived
and will not be considered by the Board without a showing of good cause.
See 37 C.F.R. § 41.41(b)(2) (2012); see also Ex parte Borden, 93 USPQ2d

1473, 1474 (BP AI 2010) (informative) ("[T]he reply brief [is not] an
opportunity to make arguments that could have been made in the principal
brief on appeal to rebut the Examiner's rejections, but were not.").
Appellants do not provide good cause for consideration of Appellants'
belated arguments. See Reply Br. 2--4.
For all of the foregoing reasons, Appellants do not persuade us of
error in the rejection of claims 1, 4--17, and 19-23. Accordingly, we sustain
the rejection of claims 1, 4--17, and 19-23 as unpatentable over Sajassi and
Allan.
DECISION
We AFFIRM the rejection of claims 1, 4--17, and 19-23.
