DECISION ON APPEAL

Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134, Appellants appeal from the Examiner's
rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) of claims 1-3 and 16-19 as unpatentable
over Takeuchi et al. (JP 2001-243952, published Sept. 7, 2001) ("Takeuchi")
in view of Yuasa et al. (US 2005/0142442 Al, published June 30, 2005)
("Yuasa"). We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6.
We AFFIRM.

Samsung SDI Co., Ltd. is identified as the real party in interest. App.
Br. 1.

Appeal2015-003646
Application 13/065,935
Appellants claim a positive active material for a rechargeable lithium
battery comprising a lithium metal oxide represented by the following
Chemical Formula One:
Chemical Formula 1
LiaMeM'k02
wherein, in Chemical Formula 1,
Me is NixCoyMnz, M' is Mg, Al, Fe, P, or a combination thereof,
0.95:Sa < 1.05, O.OOl:Sk:SO. l, 0.5 < x:S0.65, 0.1 < y:S0.25, 0.1 < z:S0.25,
x+y+z+k=l,
M' is doped at a Li site and at least one of Ni, Co, and Mn sites
(independent claim 1; see also remaining independent claim 16).
A copy of representative claim 1, taken from the Claims Appendix of
the Appeal Brief, appears below.
1. A positive active material for a rechargeable lithium battery
comprising a lithium metal oxide represented by the following Chemical
Formula 1:
Chemical Formula 1
LiaMeM'k02
wherein, in Chemical Formula 1,
Me is NixCoyMnz, M' is Mg, Al, Fe, P, or a combination thereof,
0.95:Sa < 1.05, O.OOl:Sk:SO. l, 0.5 <x:S0.65, 0.1 < y:S0.25, 0.1 < z:S0.25,
x+y+z+k=l,
M' is doped at a Li site and at least one of Ni, Co, and Mn sites,
M' is doped in an amount at O. l mol% or 10 mol% or between 0.1
mol% and 10 mol% based on the total amount of Ni, Co, and Mn,
a doping mole ratio of M' doped at the Li site with respect to a Me site
is in the following range: about O.OOl:SALi/AMe:Sabout 0.5, and
wherein the positive active material has a heat flow maximum value at
10 WI g or 18 WI g or between 10 WI g and 18 WI g in a Differential Scanning
Calorimetry (DSC) measurement.
Appellants do not present arguments specifically directed to the
dependent claims under rejection (App. Br. 3-9). Therefore, the dependent

2

Appeal2015-003646
Application 13/065,935
claims will stand or fall with their parent independent claims of which claim
1 is representative.
We sustain the rejection of the appealed claims for the reasons
expressed by the Examiner and below.
In rejecting the independent claims, the Examiner finds that Takeuchi
discloses a positive active material comprising a lithium metal oxide having
the elements recited in claim 1 including Ni, Co, Mn, and Mg but does not
expressly teach a NixCoyMnz component doped with, for example, Mg as
claimed (Final Action 2-3). The Examiner concludes that it would have
been obvious to provide Takeuchi with such a doped component in view of
Yuasa's teaching that Li ion conductivity can be improved by substituting
Ni, Co, or Mn with, for example, Mg (id. at 3 (citing Yuasa ,-i 23)). As for
the ranges recited in claim 1, the Examiner further concludes that the
determination of such effective ranges would have been obvious (id. at

,-i bridging 3--4).
Appellants point out that Yuasa discloses "Ni in a range of 0.44 or
less" (App. Br. 4) whereas Takeuchi discloses "Ni in a range of 0.5 to 0.95"
(id.) and argues that "there appears [to] be no motivation to modify the Ni

content of ... Takeuchi at all, let alone in a manner that would require the
Ni content to fall short of the [0.5 to 0.95] range" (id.).
Appellants' argument lacks convincing merit because the Examiner
does not propose modifying the Ni content of Takeuchi to be less than 0.5.
Indeed, such a modification would fall outside the scope of claim 1.
Appellants also contend that "it would not have been obvious to
modify ... Takeuchi by including a MnxNiyCOz component with a high Ni
content (i.e., as recited in Takeuchi), as such modification would not have

been expected to benefit from the characteristics recited in Yuasa" (id. at 7).
3

Appeal2015-003646
Application 13/065,935
According to Appellants, "[a]bsent an expectation of inheriting some benefit
from the proposed modification (e.g., those disclosed in Yuasa), there
appears to be no motivation to modify Takeuchi in this way" (id.).
The Examiner expressly cites to and relies on the paragraph 23
disclosure of Yuasa which teaches that "the Li ion conductivity can be
improved by substituting Mn, Ni or Co of the layered positive electrode
material ... with any one or more types of metallic elements: Al, B, Fe, Cu,
Mg, Zn, Ga, and Si" (Yuasa 11. 1-5 of,-i 23) (Final Action 3). Appellants do
not address this teaching and therefore do not explain why it would not have
suggested substituting the Mn, Ni, or Co of Takeuchi with, for example, Mg
based on a reasonable expectation of improving Li ion conductivity as taught
by Yuasa. The record before us reflects that such a modification would have
resulted in a lithium metal oxide having the Ni content disclosed by
Takeuchi and required by claim 1 as well as the improved Li ion
conductivity taught by Yuasa.
In summary, Appellants fail to show error in the § 103 rejection of the
independent claims.
The decision of the Examiner is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § l.136(a).

AFFIRMED
