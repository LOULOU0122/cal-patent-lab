JENNIFER R. GUPTA, Administrative Patent Judges.
GUPTA, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellants 1 appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
decision2 finally rejecting claims 1, 3, 7, and 8. We have jurisdiction under
35 U.S.C. § 6(b). We affirm.
The claims are directed to a multi-component fiber. Claim 1,
reproduced below, is illustrative of the claims on appeal.

Appellants identify the real parties in interest as 3M Company and its
affiliate 3M Innovative Properties Company. Appeal Brief filed
August 14, 2014 ("Br."), 2.

Final Office Action mailed March 24, 2014 ("Final Act.").

Appeal2015-002499
Application 12/808,013
1. A multi-component fiber comprising at least first and second
polymers wherein the first polymer is a sheath of the fiber and
the second polymer is a core of the fiber, wherein the first
polymer is selected from the group consisting of an
ethylene(meth)acrylic acid copolymer, ethylene(meth)acrylic
acid ionomer, a blend of ethylene(meth)acrylic acid ionomer
and polyamide, and a blend of ethylene(meth)acrylic acid
ionomer polyvinylidene fluoride; and the second polymer is
selected from the group consisting of a polyamide, a
polyphenylene sulfide, further wherein the fiber has a length
of up to 20 mm and an average diameter of up to 100
micrometers.
App. Br. (Claims Appendix) 9.
DISCUSSION
Claims 1, 3, 7, and 8 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Brown et al. (US 5,662,978, issued Sep. 2, 1997)
(hereinafter "Brown") in view of Patel et al. (US 2002/0147273 Al,
published Oct. 10, 2002) (hereinafter "Patel"). Final Act. 2--4.
Appellants argue the claims as a group. We select claim 1 as
representative of the rejected claims, and the remaining claims on appeal
will stand or fall with claim 1. (See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv) (2015)).
The Examiner finds that Brown teaches conjugate fibers which may
be in a sheath/core configuration and formed from polyolefins and
polyamides (Brown Abstract). Final Act. 2-3. The Examiner, however,
acknowledges that Brown does not expressly disclose the sheath as being
one of the polymers recited in claim 1. Id. at 3. In addition, the Examiner
finds that Brown teaches that its fibers may be "staple length or longer"
(Brown 6:55-58) and have an average diameter of from about 0.5 microns to
about 50 microns (Id. at 2: 1---6). Final Act. 3. The Examiner finds that Patel
2

Appeal2015-002499
Application 12/808,013
teaches fibers produced from a composition comprising a blend of a
substantially hydrogenated block polymer and a polyolefin, such as
ethylene/acrylic acid (EAA) and ethylene/methacrylic acid (EMAA)
ionomers (Id. i-fi-157-58, 63), which may be used in a conjugated
configuration, as a core or sheath (Patel Abstract, i1206). Id. at 4. The
Examiner finds that one of ordinary skill in the art would have been
motivated, based on the teachings of Patel (Patel i-f 12), to use
ethylene/acrylic acid (EAA) and ethylene/methacrylic acid (EMAA)
ionomers as the sheath forming component in Brown's conjugate fiber to
provide the fiber with improved strength and melt processability. Id.
Appellants argue that the Examiner relies on Brown's teaching "staple
length fibers" to meet the fiber length recited in claim 1, but fails to provide
any evidentiary support that "staple length fibers" is known to have a length
that meets the claimed range of up to 20 mm. Br. 6. The Examiner responds
to Appellants argument by citing a U.S. patent publication, Kouta et al.
(US 2008/0167634 Al, published July 10, 2008) (hereinafter "Kouta"), as
evidence that it was well known in the art that staple fibers have lengths of
0.1 to 30 mm (Kouta i164), which substantially overlaps the range of lengths
recited in claim 1. Ans. 5. Appellants have not filed a Reply Brief, and thus
fail to explain why the noticed fact was not well-known at the time of the
invention.
Appellants argue that the Examiner's motivation for combining the
references, i.e., improved strength and melt processability, is improper
because the Examiner has not shown that Patel's improvements would have
been desirable to Brown's fiber or that Brown would retain such
improvements after being modified as proposed by the Examiner. Br. 7.

Appeal2015-002499
Application 12/808,013
"Obviousness does not require [an] absolute predictability of success ... all
that is required is a reasonable expectation of success." In re Kubin, 5 61
F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing In re O'Farrell, 853 F.2d 894, 903904 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). Brown expressly discloses that strength is a desirable
characteristic for its conjugate fiber which are used as protective covers for
vehicles and equipment. Brown 1:28-31. Brown teaches that its conjugate
fiber preferably includes a polyolefin sheath (Brown Abstract), but does not
specify the particular polyolefins recited in claim 1. Patel teaches that its
composition, which can include a polyolefin as recited in claim 1 (e.g., EAA
or EMAA), provides improved strength properties in fibers produced
therefrom (Patel i-f 12), and can be used in a conjugated configuration as a
core or sheath (Id. at i-f 206). On this record, Appellants have not provided
sufficient explanation or evidence to persuade us that it would have been
unreasonable to expect Patel's composition to provide improved strength
when used as the sheath material in Brown's conjugate sheath/core
configuration.
For the reasons stated in the Final Office Action, the Examiner's
Answer, and above, a preponderance of the evidence, including due
consideration of Appellants' arguments, favors the Examiner's conclusion of
obviousness as to claims 1, 3, 7, and 8. Accordingly, we affirm the rejection
of claims 1, 3, 7, and 8 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Brown in view of
Patel.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a).

AFFIRMED
