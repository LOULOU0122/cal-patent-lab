DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Introduction
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
rejection of claims 8-23. Claims 1-7 have been canceled. We have
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b ).
We affirm.
Appellants' disclosed and claimed invention relates to an apparatus
(claim 8) and computer program product (claim 14) for managing traffic
lights at an intersection when an emergency vehicle is approaching the
intersection (Spec. i-f 2; Figs. 1-2; claims 8 and 14).

Appeal2015-001929
Application 13/289,456
RELATED APPEALS
The instant case on appeal (Application No. 13/289,456 and Appeal
No. 2015-001929 drawn to an apparatus and computer program product for
managing traffic lights) is related to Application No. 13/416,167 and Appeal
No. 2015-001777 (drawn to a method of managing traffic lights) filed by the
same assignee (IBM Corporation) and inventive entity (see Inventors listed

supra). Application No. 13/416, 167 is the basis for the Examiner's
provisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection discussed infra.

Exemplary Claim
Independent claim 8 under appeal is exemplary and reads as follows,
with emphasis added to the key disputed portion of the claim:
8. An apparatus for managing traffic lights, comprising:
a sampling device configured to sample a first signal
having a predefined characteristic and emitted by a vehicle;
a processing system configured to perform:
receiving a route to be taken by the vehicle;
identifying an intersection on the route;

identifYing a first traffic light controlling, at the
intersection, traffic going in a direction to be followed by
the vehicle upon arriving at the intersection, according to
the route;
identifying a second traffic light controlling, at the
intersection, traffic going in another direction;
receiving a first signal sample of the first signal
received by the sampling device;

2

Appeal2015-001929
Application 13/289,456
determining, from an analysis of the first signal
sample, whether the vehicle is approaching;
upon the vehicle approaching,
instructing the second traffic light to change
its state to block traffic and
instructing the first traffic light to change its
state to authorize traffic to facilitate passage of the
vehicle at the intersection.

Examiner's Rejections
(1) The Examiner provisionally rejected claims 14--20 under the
judicially created doctrine of non-statutory, obviousness-type double
patenting over claims 1-7 of Application 13/416,167. 1 Final Act. 10-12.
(2) The Examiner rejected claims 8-12 and 14--18 as being
unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over the combination of Cornett (US
8,094,040 Bl; issued Jan. 10, 2012) and Klosinski (US 5,889,475; issued
Mar. 30, 1999). 2 Final Act. 2-5.
(3) The Examiner rejected claims 13 and 19 as being unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Cornett, Klosinski, Cleland (US

1

Because Appellants fail to present any arguments as to the provisional
obviousness-type double patenting rejection (see App. Br. 4, fn.1 ), we
sustain this rejection proforma.
2
Appellants argue claims 8-12 and 14--18 together as a group, and presents
arguments only with regard to claims 8 and 14 and the disclosure of Cornett
(App. Br. 10-14; Reply Br. 2-5). Claims 8 and 14 contain similar features
relating to traffic light management. Accordingly, we select claim 8 as
representative for the group of claims 8-12 and 14--18 rejected over the
combination of Cornett and Klosinski, and our analysis will only address
claim 8.

Al; published Feb. 3, 2005). Final Act. 5-7.
(4) The Examiner rejected claims 21 and 23 as being unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Cornett, Klosinski, and Obeck (US
4,573,049; Feb. 25, 1996). Final Act. 7-8.
(5) The Examiner rejected dependent claims 20 and 22 as being
unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Cornett, Klosinski, and Gross
(US 6,326,903 Bl; issued Dec. 4, 2001). Final Act. 8-10.

Issues on Appeal
Based on Appellants' arguments in the Appeal Brief (App. Br. 5-18)
and the Reply Brief (Reply Br. 2-8), the following four issues are presented
on appeal:
(1) Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 8-12 and 14--18 as being
obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) because the combination of Cornett and
Klosinski fails to teach or suggest "identifying a first traffic light controlling,
at the intersection, traffic going in a direction to be followed by the vehicle
upon arriving at the intersection, according to the route," as recited in
representative claim 8?
(2) Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 13 and 19 as being
obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) because Cleland is non-analogous to
Appellants' invention as recited in claims 13 and 19, and is therefore not
properly combinable with Cornett, Klosinski, and Eggers?
(3) Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 21 and 23 as being
obvious over the combination of Cornett, Klosinski, and Obeck because
Obeck and the resultant combination fails to teach identifying a direction of
a vehicle upon arriving at an intersection, as recited in claims 21 and 23?

Appeal2015-001929
Application 13/289,456
(4) Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 20 and 22 as being
obvious over the combination of Cornett, Klosinski, and Gross because
Gross and the resultant combination fails to teach or suggest "broadcasting,
using a broadcasting device positioned at the intersection ... GPS
coordinates of the vehicle," as recited in claims 20 and 22?

ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejections (Final Act. 2-12;
Ans. 2-10) in light of Appellants' contentions in the Appeal Brief (App.
Br. 5-18) and Reply Brief (Reply Br. 2-8) that the Examiner has erred in
light of the Examiner's response to Appellants' arguments in the Appeal
Brief (Ans. 2-10). We disagree with Appellants' contentions.

Claims 8-12 and 14-18
With regard to representative claim 8, we adopt as our own (1) the
findings and reasons set forth by the Examiner in the Action from which this
appeal is taken (Final Act. 2--4), and (2) the reasons set forth by the
Examiner in the Examiner's Answer in response to Appellants' Appeal Brief
(see Ans. 3-7). We concur with the conclusions reached by the Examiner as

to representative claim 8, and highlight and address specific findings and
arguments for emphasis as follows.
The Examiner relies upon Cornett as disclosing managing traffic
lights as recited in claim 8, except for "receiving a route to be taken by the
vehicle, and identifying an intersection on the route" (Final Act. 3). We
agree with the Examiner that Cornett provides a system for changing the
traffic light to green in the direction of travel of the vehicle by changing a
traffic light controlling traffic going in a direction to be followed by the

5

Appeal2015-001929
Application 13/289,456
vehicle upon arriving at the intersection, since all lights are turned red except
the direction of travel of the vehicle (Ans. 3--4). We also agree with the
Examiner that Klosinski discloses (i):
[T]hat it has been specifically known to use vehicle route
information to determine the vehicle direction at the
intersection (i.e.[,] whether the vehicle will go straight, tum left,
or tum right at the intersection) to change a corresponding
traffic light based on the direction of travel of the vehicle, as a
known and specific way to accurately determine the direction
the vehicle will be traveling at the intersection
(Ans. 5); and (ii) "a traffic light system may receive route information of the
emergency vehicle and change the lights based on the received route
information" (Ans. 6), thereby disclosing "the missing element of Cornett of
not receiving route information by the traffic light" (Ans. 6). Lastly, we
agree with the Examiner's determinations that adding Klosinski' s routebased determination feature to Cornett' s traffic light management method
"would increase the efficiency of the system by decreasing false
determination[ s] of the intended vehicle travel direction" (Ans. 6); and (ii)
"improve efficiency of the emergency responsiveness of the emergency
response vehicle personnel by eliminating time otherwise wasted" (Ans. 7).
In view of the foregoing, Appellants' arguments as to Comett's
disclosure are not persuasive because the Examiner relies upon the
combination of Cornett and Klosinski in reaching the conclusion of
obviousness.

6

Appeal2015-001929
Application 13/289,456
Claims 13 and 19

With regard to claims 13 and 19, Appellants argue (App. Br. 15-16;
Reply Br. 5---6) that Cleland is a non-analogous reference because it concerns
adjusting light output, not managing traffic lights and emergency vehicles.
A reference qualifies as prior art for an obviousness determination
under § 103 only when it is analogous to the claimed invention. In re Klein,
647 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Innovention Toys, LLC v. MGA
Entm 't, Inc., 637 F.3d 1314, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2011); In re Bigio, 381 F.3d

1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2004); In re Clay, 966 F.2d 656, 658 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
A reference is considered analogous prior art: ( 1) if the reference is from the
same field of endeavor as the claimed subjected matter, regardless of the
problem addressed, or (2) if "the reference still is reasonably pertinent to the
particular problem with which the inventor is involved," even though the
reference is not within the field of the inventor's endeavor. Bigio, 381 F.3d
at 1325. The "field of endeavor" test asks if the structure and function of the
prior art is such that it would be considered by a person of ordinary skill in
the art, because of the similarity to the structure and function of the claimed
invention as disclosed in the application. Bigio, 381 F.3d at 1325-27.
Cleland discloses "[ o]ther embodiments can receive a lumen level
trigger from signals transmitted from an emergency vehicle. For example,
the signal on an emergency vehicle that turns intersection lights green for
ambulances and fire trucks" (i-f 68). Therefore, we agree with the Examiner
that Cleland is analogous art because paragraph 68 of Cleland describes both
traffic lights and emergency vehicles, and therefore the combination of
references relied upon teaches or suggests the invention recited in claim 6
(Final Act. 6-7; Ans. 7).

7

Appeal2015-001929
Application 13/289,456
In this light, we cannot agree with Appellants' contentions (App. Br.
15-16; Reply Br. 5---6) that Cleland is non-analogous art because it pertains
to adjusting light output of a light fixture and is not related to traffic light
management. Instead, we agree with the Examiner (Ans. 8) that Cleland is
analogous to the subject matter of claim 6, and thus, is properly combinable.
Claims 21 and 23

With regard to the obviousness rejection of claims 21 and 23,
Appellants argue that Obeck fails to teach identifying a direction of a vehicle
upon arriving at an intersection (App. Br. 16; Reply Br. 6). This is
unpersuasive because (i) we agree with the Examiner's response as to
Cornett and Klosinski (see Ans. 8-9); (ii) we agree with the Examiner that
"Obeck discloses it is known for a processing system to identify the
direction to be followed by the vehicle upon arriving at the inter[ se ]ction
using the received route (col. 2, lines 13-35)" (Final Act. 8); and (iii) we
agree with the Examiner's findings and reasoning supporting the conclusion
of obviousness (Final Act. 7-8).
Claims 20 and 22

With regard to the obviousness rejection of claims 20 and 22,
Appellants argue that Gross fails to broadcast Global Positioning System
(GPS) coordinates at an intersection by using a broadcasting device located
at the intersection, and instead Gross broadcasts from vehicle to vehicle
(App. Br. 17-18; Reply Br. 6-7). Appellants' argument is not persuasive,
because we agree with the Examiner (Final Act. 9-10; Ans. 9-10) that Gross
does indeed teach broadcasting GPS coordinates (see col. 12, 1. 1) from a
device at an intersection, because Figures 1 and 7 show a traffic
light/intersection environment and associated method of operating traffic

Application 13/289,456
lights 4 using a signal transceiver 5 for just such a purpose (see col. 9, 11. 1626 discussing traffic signal transceiver 5; see also col. 11, 11. 6 to col. 12, 1.

1).
Summary
In view of all of the foregoing, we sustain the Examiner's obviousness
rejection of representative and sole independent claim 8, as well as claims 912 and 14--18 grouped therewith. For similar reasons as provided for claim
8 supra, and based on the Examiner's findings and reasoning and the
amplifications provided supra, we also sustain the Examiner's remaining
three obviousness rejections of claims 13 and 19-23.

DECISION
(1) The Examiner's decision provisionally rejecting claims 14--20 for
obviousness-type double patenting is affirmed proforma.
(2) The Examiner's obviousness rejections of claims 8-23 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) are affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l). See 37 C.F.R.
§§ 41.50(f), 41.52(b) (2013).
