Appeal2015-005905
Application 13/007,792
Technology Center 2400

Before KRISTEN L. DROESCH, JENNIFER L. McKEOWN, and
JOHN P. PINKERTON, Administrative Patent Judges.
McKEOWN, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
decision to finally reject claims 1, 4--7, 9-19, 21-24, 26-36, 38--41, 43-53,
55-58, and 60-69. Claims 2, 3, 8, 20, 25, 37, 42, 54, and 59 are cancelled.
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We reverse.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellant's invention relates to "techniques for allowing a user to
indicate the significance of portions of a video during video capturing by
applying pressure to a surface of a video capture device." Abstract.

Appeal2015-005905
Application 13/007,792
Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed invention and reads as follows:
1. A method comprising:
detecting pressure applied by a user to a surface of
a video capturing device during video capture of a
plurality of video frames;
identifying frames for which the detected pressure
exceeds a threshold;
correlating amounts of the detected pressure with
identified frames captured at the times the amounts are
detected;
generating data indicating the correlations of the
amounts of the detected pressure with the identified
frames; and
marking the identified frames that are captured
while pressure is applied to indicate a significance of the
identified frames based on the detected pressure.
THE REJECTIONS
The Examiner rejected claims 1, 4--7, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21-24, 30, 31,
34, 36, 38--41, 47, 48, 51, 53, 55-58, 64, 65, and 68 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(a) as anticipated by Yabu (WO 2010/134324; Pub. Date: Nov. 25,
2010). Final Act. 7-18. 1
The Examiner rejected claims 18, 35, 52, and 69 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as unpatentable over Yabu and Agnihotri (US 2006/0165379 Al;
Jul. 27, 2006). Final Act. 18-19.
The Examiner rejected claims 9-12, 26-29, 43--46, and 60-63 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Yabu and Komori (US
2006/0044955 Al; Mar. 2, 2006). Final Act. 19-23.

Appeal2015-005905
Application 13/007,792

The Examiner rejected claims 15, 16, 32, 33, 49, 50, 66, and 67 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Yabu and Bean (US 2003/0146981
Al; Aug. 7, 2003). Final Act. 23-32.

ANALYSIS
THE ANTICIPATION REJECTION BASED ON YABU

Claims 1, 4-7, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21-24, 30, 31, 34, 36, 38-41, 47, 48, 51, 53,
55-58, 64, 65, and 68
Based on the record before us, we are persuaded the Examiner erred
in rejecting claims 1, 4--7, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21-24, 30, 31, 34, 36, 38--41, 47,
48, 51, 53, 55-58, 64, 65, and 68 as anticipated by Yabu.
Appellants contend that Y abu fails to disclose detecting pressure
applied by a user to a surface of a video capturing device during video

capture of a plurality of video frames, as required by independent claims 1,
19, 36, and 53. App. Br. 12. Appellants assert that Yabu "is completely
silent with respect to video capture, much less detecting pressure during
video capture." App. Br. 12. Specifically, Appellants maintain that "Yabu
describes the tiresome process of manually going through images after
capture to select desired images" and contrasts Y abu' s approach with
paragraph 25 of the Specification that states the disclosed techniques may
eliminate the need to manually go through the video after capture or play
back the entire video. App. Br. 12-14.
On the other hand, the Examiner explains, in Yabu "[ w ]hen a user
touches the touchscreen to select frames for display, the frames are captured
by the user." Ans. 28. As such, the Examiner interprets Yabu's selecting of
the frames to correspond to the capture of a plurality of video frames.

Appeal2015-005905
Application 13/007,792
We agree with Appellants that the Examiner's interpretation is in
error. We understand the plain and ordinary meaning of capture, within the
context of the Specification here, would be to "to record in the form of
stored data." See "capture." Webster's New World College Dictionary
(2010), available at 1lttb~~~l~~~~~~}~~}3~~:)L~~L!I~~1ii~~tLi2ll~ll~Y~~~~~i2K!Jl~~~~~lI~Lt!!~~ (last visited

September 16, 2016); see also "capture." Merriam-Webster Online
Dictionary (2016), available at

k!JJp_;/l?i:WYLJE~rij~rnJ~.

capture as "the act of putting information in a form that a computer can use
or read" or "the act of recording in a permanent file <data capture>").
Based on this interpretation, Y abu' s mere selection of frames fails to satisfy
the recited limitation of during the capture of a plurality of video frames, as
required by independent claims 1, 19, 36, and 53.
Accordingly, we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 1,
4--7, 13, 14, 17, 19,21-24,30,31,34,36,38--41,47,48,51,53,55-58, 64,
65, and 68 as anticipated by Yabu.

THE REMAINING REJECTIONS BASED ON Y ABU AND
ADDITIONALLY CITED PRIOR ART

Claims 9-12, 15, 16, 18, 26--29, 32, 33, 35, 43--46, 49,
50, 52, 60--63, 66, 67, and 69

Each of claims 9-12, 15, 16, 18, 26-29, 32, 33, 35, 43--46, 49,
50, 52, 60-63, 66, 67, and 69 are dependent on one of claims 1, 19, 36, and
53. As discussed above, we find that the Examiner erred in rejecting
independent claims 1, 19, 36, and 53. The additionally cited prior art fail to
cure the deficiencies of Y abu and, therefore, we also find the Examiner erred
in rejecting these dependent claims. Accordingly, we do not sustain the
4

Appeal2015-005905
Application 13/007,792
Examiner's rejection of claims 9-12, 15, 16, 18, 26-29, 32, 33, 35, 43--46,
49, 50, 52, 60-63, 66, 67, and 69 as unpatentable over the cited
combinations of prior art.

DECISION
We reverse the Examiner's decision to reject claims 1, 4--7, 9-19, 2124, 26-36, 38--41, 43-53, 55-58 and 60-69.
