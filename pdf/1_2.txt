STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants' invention relates to "scheduling e-meetings in a
collaborative computing environment." Spec. i-f 1. Claim 1 is illustrative and
reproduced below:
1.
A method for e-meeting requirements assurance in
e-meeting management, the method comprising:
selecting a scheduled e-meeting for an invitee in memory
of a computer;
retrieving resource requirements published in a document
for the selected scheduled e-meeting, the document indicating
required resource requirements for the selected scheduled emeeting, the required resource requirements including at least
one of a particular Web browser, a particular revision of the
particular Web browser, and a pre-installed computer program;
inspecting local computing resources of the invitee;
comparing the local computing resources to the retrieved
resource requirements to identify local resource deficiencies;
and,
generating a notice of the local resource deficiencies to the
invitee prior to a scheduled date and time for thee-meeting.
ANALYSIS
THE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION REJECTION OF CLAIM

3

The Examiner finds claim 3 fails to comply with the written
description requirement. Ans. 4--5. The Examiner finds "Applicant
discloses 'extracting a reference .... ' which is not described in the
disclosure." Ans. 5.
Claim 3 (emphasis added) is reproduced below:

2

Appeal2014-009641
Application 13/526,438
3.
The method of claim 1, wherein retrieving resource
requirements published for the selected scheduled e-meeting,
comprises:

extracting a reference to a remote resource requirements
document from the scheduled e-meeting; and,
retrieving resource requirements from the referenced
remote resource requirements document.
Appellants present the following principal arguments:
"[C]laim 3 of Appellants' originally filed specification recites

1.

the language 'extracting a reference to a remote resource requirements
document from the scheduled e-meeting. "' App. Br. 4; see also Reply Br.
2-3.
Appellants' originally filed Specification (i-f 16) describes the

11.

recited (claim 3) extracting a reference. App. Br. 4--5; see also Reply Br. 3.
In response, the Examiner explains "'extracting a reference ... ' is
definitely not the same as 'determining the resource requirements of a e•

meetmg uy usmg a re1erence m an e-meetmg mvite WuiCu pomts to a
remotely disposed requirements document, which lists the required resources
of thee-meeting'. Furthermore, such limitation was nowhere to be found in
the cited paragraph 16." Ans. 9.
Appellants have persuaded us that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claim 3 for failing to meet the written description requirement.
"[T]he test for sufficiency [of the written description] is whether the
disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled
in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of
the filing date." Ariad Pharm., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1351
(Fed. Cir. 2010) (en bane).
Currently pending claim 3 is the same as original claim 3.
3

Appeal2014-009641
Application 13/526,438
Appellants' original Specification 1 (if 16) discloses:
The invite 130 can include a requirements reference 150 to
requirements document 160 of required resources for the invitee.
The e-meeting 140 can be scheduled in calendar 120 of the
computer 110. Thereafter, before the scheduled date and time of
the e-meeting 140, the resources of the computer 110 can be
inspected by resource inspector 170 and compared to those of the
requirements document 160.
First, original claim 3 provides a satisfactory description to support
currently pending claim 3 because currently pending claim 3 is the same as
original claim 3, and we determine a skilled artisan would have recognized
that Appellants had possession of the claimed subject matter based on the
content of original claim 3.
Second, the original Specification (if 16) provides a satisfactory
description to support currently pending claim 3 because a skilled artisan
would have understood that the original Specification (if 16) disclosures "The invite 130 can include a requirements reference 150 to requirements
document 160" and "the resources of the computer 110 can be inspected by
resource inspector 170 and compared to those of the requirements document
160" -

describe extraction of the reference 150 from the invite 130 to

permit access to the requirements document 160.
Thus, we find the above disclosures in the Specification adequate to
convey reasonably to those skilled in the art that Appellants had possession
of the recited "extracting a reference to a remote resource requirements
document from the scheduled e-meeting" as of the filing date.

1

In our analysis, to decide whether or not the inventors had possession of
the claimed subject matter as of the filing date, we refer to the original
Specification at paragraph 16.
4

Appeal2014-009641
Application 13/526,438
In addition, in response to the Final Action, on December 3, 2013,
Appellants filed amendments to Specification i-fi-f 16, 22. The Advisory
Action mailed December 19, 2013 indicates that these amendments will be
entered. However, in the Response to Arguments section of the Examiner's
Answer, the Examiner states that the amended paragraphs 16 and 22 were
not entered. See Ans. 9. Although we did not rely on the amendments in
determining sufficient written description was present, should prosecution of
this application continue, the Examiner should clarify the status of these
amendments to the Specification i-fi-f 16, 22. Because we find Appellants had
possession of the recited "extracting a reference to a remote resource
requirements document from the scheduled e-meeting" as of the filing date,
for the same reasons, we find that Appellants proffered amendments to the
Specification paragraphs 16 and 22 do not introduce new matter.
We, therefore, do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 3.

THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION OF CLAIMS

1-7 OVER KENOYER AND COLBY

The Examiner finds Kenoyer and Colby teach all limitations of claim
1. Ans. 5---6. The Examiner relies on Colby's microphone and camera check

for teaching the recited (claim 1) "retrieving resource requirements
published" and the recited (claim 1) "inspecting local computing resources
of the invitee." Ans. 6 (citing Colby col. 32, 1. 38 - col. 33, 1. 35); see also
Ans. 10 (Colby's microphone and camera check are resource requirements).
The Examiner relies on Colby and Kenoyer for teaching the recited (claim 1)
"the required resource requirements including at least one of a particular
Web browser, a particular revision of the particular Web browser, and a preinstalled computer program." Ans. 11 ("In paragraph 35, Kenoyer discloses

5

Appeal2014-009641
Application 13/526,438
the video conferencing system components including a display, which
Examiner construes as 'the web browser' satisfying one of the
requirement[ s] of 'at least one [of] a ... ' Furthermore, Colby discloses an IE4
browser (i.e. particular browser) ([col. 30, 11. 32-36; col. 31, 11. 19-24]).").
Appellants present the following principal arguments:
1.

"Colby discloses retrieving resource requirements from a

database and performing checks via an ActiveX control on a microphone
and a camera. But Colby fails to teach or suggest that the retrieved resource
requirements are published in a document for a selected scheduled emeeting." App. Br. 8-9; see also Reply Br. 6 ("Colby suggests that the
resource requirements are used to configure the network for a broadcast, so
to establish an ASP stream path. As such, 'Check Microphone' and 'Check
Camera' are not resource requirements.").
11.

"There is nothing in Kenoyer that indicates that the required

resource requires a particular Web browser, a particular version of the Web
browser, or a preinstalled computer program." App. Br. 10; see also Reply
Br. 6-7 (Kenoyer's display is not a Web browser).
Appellants persuade us that the Examiner erred in finding Colby
teaches retrieving published resource requirements.
First, we agree with Appellants (see App. Br. 8-9, Reply Br. 5---6) that
Colby's "Check Microphone" and "Check Camera" are not resource
requirements published in a document. Colby discloses:
The resource requirements will be retrieved from the InterVU
database and passed to the InterVU network topology manager
using ASP technology when the "Start" button on the ActiveX
control is selected. The topology manager will configure the
network for the broadcast and return the connection information
to the ActiveX control. This will establish the ASP stream path
6

Appeal2014-009641
Application 13/526,438
through the firewall tunnel, from the encoder to the NetShow
servers.
Colby col. 32, 11. 55---63.
Thus, Colby's "resource requirements" relate to the network
configuration and are not directed to resource requirements for an invitee.
Colby further discloses the publisher performing microphone and camera
checks. See Colby col. 33, 11. 1---6. However, these checks are unrelated to
Colby's resource requirements. Further, even to the extent these checks
could be considered as related to resource requirements, these checks are
performed using ActiveX controls, and the Examiner has not shown how
ActiveX controls relate to the inspecting and comparing of local computing
resources, as recited in claim 1.
In addition, Appellants also persuade us that the Examiner erred in
finding Kenoyer and Colby teach the recited (claim 1) "the required resource
requirements including at least one of a particular Web browser, a particular
revision of the particular Web browser, and a pre-installed computer
program."
We adopt the plain meaning of "Web browser" in the computer
context. The plain meaning of "Web browser" in the computer context is
"Software that lets a user view HTML documents and access files and
software related to those documents." MICROSOFT COMPUTER
DICTIONARY 562 (5th ed. 2002). In light of this plain meaning, we find
the Examiner erred in finding Kenoyer' s display teaches the recited Web
browser or revision thereof.
Second, although Colby discloses (Colby col. 30, 11. 32-36; col. 31, 11.
19-24) initiating an IE4 browser, which is a particular Web browser, the
Examiner does not explain how or why, nor do we readily see how or why,
7

Appeal2014-009641
Application 13/526,438
Colby's IE4 browser is related to Colby's "resource requirements" which
relate to the network configuration. See Colby col. 32, 11. 55---63. Thus,
neither Kenoyer nor Colby teaches the recited (claim 1) "the required
resource requirements including at least one of a particular Web browser, a
particular revision of the particular Web browser, and a pre-installed
computer program."
We, therefore, do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1, or
of claims 2-7, which depend from claim 1.

THE PROVISIONAL REJECTION OF CLAIMS 1-7
OVER APPLICATION No. 12/828, 263
The Examiner provisionally rejected claims 1-7 on the ground of
nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting over Application No.
12/828,263. Ans. 4.
Appellants do not present any arguments with respect to this
provisional rejection. See App. Br. 3, FN 1.
We, therefore, pro form a sustain the Examiner's provisional rejection
of claims 1-7.

ORDER
The Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1-7 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l ).
