HASTINGS, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellants 1 appeal from the
Examiner's decision finally rejecting claims 1-3, 10, 45--47, 54, 184, and
185 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). We have jurisdiction over the appeal under
35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM-IN-PART.

The real party in interest is stated to be Merck Patent GmbH (Br. 5).

Appeal2015-001330
Application 11/167,763
Claims 1 and 185 are illustrative of the appealed subject matter
(emphasis added to highlight key limitations):
1. A method, comprising:
providing a sensor in association with a photovoltaic facility to
form a sensor-pv facility, the photovoltaic facility comprising
first, second, and third photovoltaic cells, the second
photovoltaic cell having a first corner and a second corner
opposite the first corner; and
providing the sensor-pv facility in a kit to be deployed in a home
environment,
wherein
the first and second photovoltaic cells are joined at the first
corner by a first connection that can rotate so that the first and
second photovoltaic cells can rotate over each other;
the second and third photovoltaic cells are joined at the second
corner by a second connection that can rotate so that the second
and third photovoltaic cells can rotate over each other; and
the first connection comprises an electrical connection between
the first and second photovoltaic cells or the second connection

comprises an electrical connection between the second and third
photovoltaic cells.
184. The method of claim 1 wherein the photovoltaic cells are
rectangular and the second corner is diagonally opposite the
first corner.
(Br. 21, 23; Claims App.)
The Examiner maintains, and Appellants appeal, the following
rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a):
Claims 1-3, 10, 45--47, 54, 184, and 185 are rejected as unpatentable
over Batts-Gowins (US 2002/0171391 Al, published Nov. 21, 2002)
(hereinafter "Batts-Gowins") in view ofLiebeskind (US 4,114,307, issued

Appeal2015-001330
Application 11/167,763
Sept. 19, 197 8) (hereinafter "Liebeskind"), and further in view of Seefluth
(DE 10127292 Al, published Dec. 12, 2002) (hereinafter "Seefluth").
Appellants' arguments urging reversal of the§ 103 rejection focus on
limitations common to independent claims 1 and 45 (Br. 5-16; 19). In the
absence of arguments specific to their patentability, dependent claims 2, 3,
10, 46, 4 7, and 54 stand or fall with each of their respective independent
claims. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv). Appellants present separate arguments
urging reversal of the§ 103 rejection of claims 184 and 185 (Br. 16-19).

ANALYSIS
Upon consideration of the evidence on this record and each of
Appellants' contentions, we find that the preponderance of evidence on this
record supports the Examiner's conclusion that the subject matter of
Appellants' claims 1 and 45 are unpatentable over the applied prior art. We
sustain the Examiner's§ 103 rejection of claims 1-3, 10, 45--47, and 54 for
essentially the reasons set out by the Examiner in the Answer.
On the other hand, we agree with Appellants that the Examiner has
not shown that each and every limitation of claims 184 and 185 is either
described or suggested by the prior art, and we reverse the Examiner's § 103
rejection with respect to claims 184 and 185.
We add the following primarily for emphasis.
With respect to claims 1 and 45, Appellants contend that the
Examiner's relied upon passages in Batts-Gowins merely refer to the folding
properties of Batts-Gowins' hinged solar panel (Br. 11 ). Therefore,
according to Appellants, Batts-Gowins fails to teach or suggest "two panels
connected such that they 'can rotate over each other' as claimed" (id.). This
3

Appeal2015-001330
Application 11/167,763
argument is not persuasive, because, as pointed out by the Examiner, BattsGowins' hinged solar panels teach photovoltaic cells "'rotating over each
other' along a side, or an edge of the panel, where the hinges are located"
(Ans. 2).
Appellants further contend that the combination of Batts-Gowins and
Liebeskind does not teach or suggest three photovoltaic cells rotating at two
different comer connections, where the second photovoltaic cell has a
second comer connection that is opposite the first comer connection (Br.
12-15). 2 This argument is not persuasive, because, as pointed out by the
Examiner, Liebeskind teaches rotation at a pivot along a side which can be
viewed as substantially at a comer, and locating pivots at both comers of
Batts-Gowins as a modification for the hinged-folding mechanism of BattsGowins would have been reasonably inferred by the skilled artisan as one
way to fold over the solar panel as desired by Batts-Gowins (Ans. 3 (citing
Liebeskind Figs. 1--4); see also Ans. 5---6).
In evaluating references, it is proper to take into account not only the
specific teachings of the references but also the inferences which one skilled
in the art would reasonably be expected to draw therefrom. In re Preda, 401
F.2d 825, 826 (CCPA 1968); see also In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425-26
(CCP A 1981) ("The test for obviousness ... is what the combined teachings
of the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the
art."); In re Merck & Co., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("Nonobviousness cannot be established by attacking references individually

2

The Examiner relies on Seefluth "for teaching [that] a connection, where
the rotation occurs, also comprises an electrical connection" (Ans. 5).
4

Appeal2015-001330
Application 11/167,763
where the rejection is based upon the teachings of a combination of
references.").
Appellants do not provide any persuasive technical reasoning or
credible evidence to refute the Examiner's determination that it would have
been prima facie obvious to modify the hinged attachment of Batts-Gowins
to include pivot connections substantially at opposite comers (of the same
side) since pivot connections are well known and are exemplified in
Liebeskind, for the known advantages of easier storage of solar panels as
suggested by Batts-Gowins (e.g., Final Act. 4--5; Ans. 3-5; generally Br.).
KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 417--418 (2007) (using prior art

elements or steps according to their established function is ordinarily
obvious; further, the "inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary
skill in the art would employ" can be taken into account). "A person of
ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton." Id.
at 421.
On the other hand, with respect to claims 184 and 185, Appellants
argue that the combination of Batts-Gowins and Liebeskind does not teach
or suggest three photovoltaic cells rotating at two different comer
connections, where the second photovoltaic cell has a second comer
connection that is diagonally opposite the first comer connection as required
by claims 184 and 185 (Br. 16-19). A preponderance of the evidence
supports Appellants' position.
The Examiner acknowledges that modified Batts-Gowins does not
specifically disclose that the second comer is diagonally opposite the first
comer (Final Act. 7). The Examiner, however, determined that it would
have been obvious to the ordinary skilled artisan to modify the solar panels

5

Appeal2015-001330
Application 11/167,763
of Batts-Gowins by arranging the pivots of rotation at the diagonally
opposite comers, "because such modification would involve nothing more
than a mere rearrangement of parts" (id. at 7).
On the record before us, the Examiner has not shown that each and
every limitation of claims 184 and 185 is either described or suggested by
the prior art or would have been obvious based on the knowledge of the
ordinary artisan. The Examiner states that arranging rotatable solar panel
connections such that the second comer is diagonally opposite the first
comer "involve[ s] nothing more than a mere rearrangement of the
connections for [a] point rotation mechanism" (Ans. 6-7). While one of
ordinary skill in the art would have reasonably inferred from the applied
prior art that solar panels may rotate over each other via rotatable pivots
located substantially at opposite comers on the same side of a solar panel to
fold up for easier storage, the Examiner has not directed us to adequate
evidence on this record suggesting that solar panels may rotate over each
other via rotatable pivots located at diagonally opposite comers. Therefore,
we agree with Appellants that the combination of Batts-Gowins, Liebeskind,
and Seefluth does not teach three photovoltaic cells rotating at two different
comer connections, where the second comer is diagonally opposite the first
comer. As such, we cannot sustain the obviousness rejection of claims 184
and 185.
Accordingly, the Examiner's 35 U.S.C. § 103 rejection of claims 184
and 185 is reversed.
