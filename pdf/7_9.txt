CLAHvIS
Claims 1, 2, 5-7, 9, 11-17, and 19-22 are on appeal. Claims 1 and 16
are the independent claims on appeal, are illustrative of the appealed claims,
and recite:
A flanged bearing ring for a motor vehicle wheel, the ring
compnsmg:
1.

a radially inner, generally annular insert formed of a first
material with a first thermal expansion coefficient, the insert
having a central axis, at least one raceway extending about the
axis, a radially outer surface, and at least one projection
extending generally radially from the outer surface; and
a radially outer body formed of a second material with a
second thermal expansion coefficient, the second coefficient
being greater than the first coefficient, the outer body being
disposed about the insert and having a radially outwardly
extending flange and at least one radial recess configured to
receive the at least one projection of the insert so as to interlock
and prevent relative axial displacement between the insert and
the outer body,
wherein the at least one projection of the insert has an
undercut engageable with the at least one recess of the outer body
so as to prevent relative radial movement between the outer body
and the insert, and
wherein the at least one projection has two conical surf
aces tapering in a same direction, one of the two conical surfaces
forming the undercut.
16. A flanged bearing ring for a motor vehicle wheel, the ring
compnsmg:
a radially inner, generally annular insert formed of a first
material with a first thermal expansion coefficient, the insert
having an insert axial length, a central axis, at least one raceway

REJECTIONS
1. The Examiner rejects claims 1, 2, 5-7, 9, 11-15, and 20 under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Dougherty2 in view of
Matsui. 3
2. The Examiner rejects claims 16, 17, and 19 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as unpatentable over Dougherty in view of Scharpf. 4
3. The Examiner rejects claims 21 and 22 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)
as unpatentable over Dougherty in view of Scharpf and iviatsui.

DISCUSSION

Claim 1
The Examiner finds that Dougherty discloses a flanged bearing ring as
claimed, except for projection having an undercut and two conical surfaces,
one of which forms the undercut. Final Act. 2-3. The rejection relies on

Dougherty, US 6,485,188 Bl, iss. Nov. 26, 2002.
Matsui et al., US 5,079,825, iss. Jan. 14, 1992.
Scharpf, GB 1,510,546, pub. May 10, 1978.
3

Appeal2014-009932
Application 13/087,551
ivfatsui as disclosing two conical surfaces having the "same shape as the
instant application." Final Act. 3--4.
We are persuaded by Appellants' arguments that the Examiner erred
in rejecting claim 1 as obvious over Dougherty and Matsui. In particular we
agree that the projections disclosed in Matsui are not conical as claimed, and
we agree that the Examiner has not otherwise adequately shown that the use
of conical surfaces as claimed would have been obvious.
The Examiner finds that Matsui discloses a composite structure
formed of two materials connected together including a projection 7 with
two conical surfaces as claimed. Final Act. 3--4 (citing Matsui, Figs. 1b, 3,
5). More specifically, the Examiner indicates that Matsui's projection
includes two conical surfaces because they have the "same shape as the
instant application." Id. at 4. However, we agree with Appellants that while
Matsui's projection may have the same cross-sectional shape as a cone,
Matsui does not actually disclose that the projection is coned shaped and
teaches that the shape relied upon is the cross-section of what may described
as a pointed ridge. See Appeal Br. 4--5; Matsui, Fig. 8.
In response to Appellants' arguments, the Examiner finds that the
rejection relies on a combination of Matsui and Dougherty and "the resulting
configuration will clearly have the conical surfaces recited by the claim
since the structure of Matsui would extend around the device of Dougherty
(revolving the cross-sectional shape of Matsui forms a conical surface like in
the instant application)." Ans. 3. The Examiner also finds "Matsui discloses
the same general shape for a projection" and that one of ordinary skill in the
art would have the ability and knowledge to substitute between different
shapes of locking tab and projection configurations such that "[ w]hen the

4

Appeal2014-009932
Application 13/087,551
shape of ivfatsui is applied to the tab/projection of Dougherty the resulting
device will have the claimed conical surfaces." Id. at 4.
We are not persuaded that these arguments adequately support the
conclusion that it would have been obvious to use an insert having
projections shaped as claimed. Regarding the Examiner's finding that
revolving the cross-sectional shape would result in a conical surface, the
Examiner has not provided any reason why one of ordinary skill would have
found it obvious to take Matsui' s elongated flat composite structure and
rotate it such that a projection is created with two conical surfaces as
claimed. Further, we are not persuaded that Matsui's pointed ridge
projections disclose the same "general shape" as a projection with two
conical surfaces as claimed. Because the Examiner has not shown that the
claimed projection shape was known in the art, we find that the Examiner
has not adequately supported the conclusion that one of ordinary skill in the
art would have the knowledge and ability to substitute between different
shapes to arrive at a device having a projection with the claimed conical
surfaces.
For these reasons, on the record before us, we do not sustain the
rejection of claim 1. We also do not sustain the rejection of claims 2, 5-7, 9,
11-15 and 20 for the same reasons.

Claim 16
With respect to claim 16, the Examiner finds that Dougherty discloses
a bearing ring as claimed except that Dougherty does not disclose that the
insert and outer body have equal axial lengths. Final Act. 6-7. The
Examiner relies on Scharpf as teaching a bearing member with an insert and
an axial length that are equal in length. Id. at 7. The Examiner concludes

5

Appeal2014-009932
Application 13/087,551
that substituting between different lengths would provide a predictable
result. Id. The Examiner further finds that it would have been obvious to
modify Dougherty by lengthening the insert or shortening the outer member
or a combination of both to achieve the claimed dimensions. Adv. Act. 2.
Appellants argue that the proposed modifications of Dougherty would
require cutting off parts of the outer hub or reducing their size, which would
render Dougherty unsatisfactory for its intended purpose by sacrificing
function and strength. Appeal Br. 7-8. Appellants also argue that
lengthening the extent of the insert might be possible but would provide no
benefit and "the record ... contains no reason for a person of ordinary skill
in the art to make such a change." Id. at 8. Appellants further argue:
Finally, the examiner asserts that a person of ordinary skill
in the art would make one of the foregoing modifications to
Dougherty based on the teachings of Scharpf. Scharpf teaches a
hardened liner for an engine block cylinder. Scharpfs cylinder
liner does not extend beyond the cylinder that it lines. The fact
that a liner does not project out of the cylinder it lines will not
lead a person of ordinary skill in the art to cut off part of
Dougherty's hub R or extend Dougherty's raceway insert 132 to
locations where there are no roller elements to support. Scharpf
thus provides no suggestion to modify Dougherty as proposed in
the rejection of claim 16.
Appeal Br. 9.
The Examiner responds that modifications to the size of Dougherty's
components would be within the level of ordinary skill such that the outer
portions or insert would be appropriately sized. Ans. 5---6. The Examiner
also contends that lengthening the insert would "include an increased benefit
based on the properties of the inner material." Id. at 6. The Examiner also
finds that Scharpf need not provide an actual suggestion for the modification

6

Appeal2014-009932
Application 13/087,551
proposed and Scharpf is used to "demonstrate[] that the inner and outer
member of a composite member can be made the same length." Id. at 6-7.
We are persuaded of error in the rejection by Appellants' argument
that "requiring unspecified changes to unspecified components in
Dougherty, while providing no reason for making such changes, cannot
properly be characterized as obvious." Reply Br. 2. While Scharpf need not
provide a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to support the conclusion of
obviousness, we are not persuaded that the Examiner has provided an
adequate rationale for making the proposed combination. Specifically, we
find that the Examiner's conclusion that one of ordinary skill in the art
would have found it obvious to modify Dougherty based on Scharpf as a
simple substitution of one known element for another that would do no more
than yield predictable results is not supported by the record before us
because the Examiner has not established that the art provides any teaching
or suggestion, or that it would have otherwise been known or obvious to a
person of ordinary skill in the art, to vary the axial length of bearing ring
components or to make them equal to produce certain results.
Based on the foregoing, we find that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claim 16 as obvious over Dougherty and Scharpf. Accordingly, we do not
sustain the rejection of claim 16. We also do not sustain the rejection of
dependent claims 17 and 19 for the same reasons. Finally, with respect to
claims 21 and 22, the Examiner has not cited to any portion of Matsui that
cures the deficiency in the rejection of claim 16. Accordingly, we also do
not sustain the rejection of claims 21 and 22.

Appeal2014-009932
Application 13/087,551
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the rejections of claims 1,
2, 5-7, 9, 11-17, and 19-22.
