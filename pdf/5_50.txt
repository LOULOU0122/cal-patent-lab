Before JAMES C. HOUSEL, GEORGE C. BEST, and
CHRISTOPHER C. KENNEDY, Administrative Patent Judges.
HOUSEL, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL 1
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellant2 appeals from the
Examiner's decision finally rejecting claims 1, 3, 4, and 13-15 under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Jeon 3 in view ofMilgate, 4 and claims 5

1

Our decision refers to the Specification (Spec.) filed January 15, 2010,
Appellant's Appeal Brief (Br.) filed December 19, 2013, and the Examiner's
Answer (Ans.) delivered July 10, 2014.

35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We REVERSE.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The invention relates to a system and method for housing one or more
pouch battery cells. Spec. i-f 9; claims 1 and 13. Appellant discloses that
pouch battery cells expand and contract during cell charge/discharge cycles.
Spec. i-f 6. However, in order to optimize battery cell performance and
obtain maximum power density and cycle life, Appellant discloses that the
electrodes within the pouches must be constrained under constant pressure
during cycling. Id. Appellant discloses a system that maintains a constant
amount of compression on the battery cell during expansion and contraction.

Id. at i-f 9. The system includes a battery cell container interposed between a
pair of end plates, wherein the end plates are coupled together by a plurality
of connecting devices each including an elastic deformation device. Id. at
i-fi-1 9 and 10. The elastic deformation devices hold pouch battery cells

housed within the container at a constant amount of pressure during cell
expansion and contraction, which according to Appellant, optimizes the
battery cell performance. Id. Because the elastic deformation devices
include a predefined limit, Appellant discloses that the connecting device
"plastically deforms" in response to further battery cell expansion, thereby
ensuring that the amount of pressure on the battery cells remains constant
during subsequent expansion and contraction cycles. Id. at i-f 11.

Appeal2014-008319
Application 12/688,566
Claim 1, reproduced from the Claims Appendix to the Appeal Brief, is
illustrative of the subject matter on appeal. The limitation at issue is
italicized.
1. A system for housing a plurality of pouch cell batteries, the
system comprising:
a battery cell container including at least one cell
compartment interposed between a first end plate and a second
end plate;
a pouch battery cell housed within the at least one cell
compartment wherein the pouch battery cell has one or more
cell plates aligned with the first end plate and second end plate
and wherein the first end plate is connected to the second end
plate by a plurality of tension rod assemblies, each having at
least one surrounding elastic deformation device medial of a
distal end thereof operable to elastically deform to a prescribed
limit so as to place the one or more cell plates of the pouch
battery cell in a constant amount of compression, and wherein
each of the plurality of tension rod assemblies includes a
tension rod dimension so as to plastically deform upon the
elastic deformation device elasticanv deforming to the
prescribed limit.
Claim 13, the remaining independent claim on appeal, similarly
recites the limitation at issue.
Appellant contends that the applied prior art fails to disclose or
suggest tension rods with a dimension so as to plastically deform upon the
elastic deformation device elastically deforming to the prescribed limit. Br.
7-9. Appellant argues that Milgate' s rods have an essentially uniform cross
section and that Milgate teaches nothing about their deformation. Id. at 8.
Appellant also argues that the Examiner has confused the elastic
deformation devices with the tension rod assemblies, and in particular, the

3

Appeal2014-008319
Application 12/688,566
tension rod dimension designed for plastic deformation upon the elastic
deformation devices reaching their prescribed limit. Id.
In response, the Examiner "take[s] the position that the 'tension rod
dimension' is only referring to a direction and not to a tension rod itself."
Ans. 8. The Examiner finds that the plastic deformation limitation would be
met by any part of the tension rod assembly undergoing plastic deformation
after the elastic deformation of the elastic deformation device. Id. The
Examiner further finds that "[a]fter enough expansion, some part of the
tension rod assembly would have to enter a plastic deformation regime after
elastic deformation occurs because plastic deformation occurs in any
material that is beyond the point of plastic deformation as understood by one
of ordinary skill in the art." Id.
The Examiner's position is tantamount to an inherency finding. The
problem with the Examiner's position is that the Examiner's interpretation
of the limitation at issue is both inconsistent with Appellant's description of
this feature in the Specification and lacks support in the record. "'Inherency,
however, may not be established by probabilities or possibilities. The mere
fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not
sufficient. [Citations omitted.] If, however, the disclosure is sufficient to
show that the natural result flowing from the operation as taught would
result in the performance of the questioned function, it seems to be well
settled that the disclosure should be regarded as sufficient."' In re Oelrich,
666 F.2d 578, 581(CCPA1981) (quotingHansgirgv. Kemmer, 102 F.2d
212, 214 (CCPA 1939)) (emphasis and bracketed material in original).
As Appellant discloses, the connecting devices or rods are configured
to plastically deform in order to maintain a constant pressure on the

4

Appeal2014-008319
Application 12/688,566
electrodes throughout the life of the pouch battery cells. Spec.

i1 44.

Because a center portion of the rods have a smaller cross section, stress
applied to the rods is larger in these center portions. Id. As the stress rises
(due to the elastic deformation devices reaching their elastic limit), the rods
will plastically deform while maintaining a constant amount of force on the
battery cells. Id. at i1 45.
However, the Examiner fails to direct our attention to any disclosure
in the applied prior art in support of the finding that the Jeon and Milgate
combination meets the limitation at issue, nor do we find any. Further, the
Examiner fails to explain how the rods of either Jeon or Milgate include a
dimension that will function to plastically deform upon the elastic
deformation device elastically deforming to the prescribed limit. While it
may be true that any rod may experience inelastic or plastic deformation
under excessive tension, we find no support in this record that the rods of the
prior art would plastically deform upon the elastic deformation device
elastically deforming to the prescribed limit. As such, the Examiner has not
established that the rods of either Jeon or Milgate have a dimension which
would inherently or necessarily plastically deform in the manner here
disclosed and claimed. Oelrich, 666 F .2d at 581.
We, therefore, will not sustain the Examiner's § 103 rejection over
Jeon and Milgate. As the Examiner does not rely on Chiang to remedy the
above-discussed deficiency in the Jeon and Milgate combination, we
likewise will not sustain the Examiner's§ 103 rejection over the Jeon,
Milgate and Chiang combination.

DECISION
Upon consideration of the record, and for the reasons given above and
in the Appeal Brief, the decision of the Examiner rejecting claims 1, 3-5,
and 13-16 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Jeon and Milgate,
alone or further in view of Chiang, is reversed.
REVERSED
