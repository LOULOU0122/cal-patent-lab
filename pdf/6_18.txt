DECISION ON APPEAL

Appeal2015-005891
Application 12/373,829
STATEMENT OF CASE
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from a final rejection of
claims 17, 19, 21-30, and 32. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).

Exemplary Claim
Exemplary claim 17 under appeal reads as follows (emphasis,
formatting, and bracketing added):
17. An interaction system comprising:
[(A)] a detector configured to detect gazes of at least one
viewer looking at a plurality of items;
[(B)] a processor configured to[:]
[(i)] calculate cumulative gaze durations per item
of said plurality of items,
[(ii)] rank each of the plurality of items in
accordance with the calculated cumulative gaze durations
of each of said plurality of items,
[(iii)] identify a most looked at item in accordance
with said ranking,
[(iv)] create at least one group of related products
and associate the group with a group weight,
[(v)] rank each of the groups of related products,
[(vi)] divide each group of related products into
sub-groups which are further ranked and weighted to
determine sets of ordered products based on the weighted
rankings of the subgroups; and
[(C)] a display adapted to display a list of said plurality
of items and the sets of ordered products according to said
ranking and to start at least one of an audio and visual show
related to the most looked item according to said ranking.

Rejection on Appeal
The Examiner rejected claims 17, 19, 22-24, 26, 27, 29, 30, and 32
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Bell
(US 6,456,262 Bl, issued Sept. 24, 2002), Dryer et al. (US 7,120,880 Bl,
issued Oct. 10, 2006), and Hannum et al. (US 2006/0020973 Al, published
Jan. 26, 2006). 1 Final Act. 2.
The Examiner rejected claims 21, 25, and 28, under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as being unpatentable over various combinations of Bell, Dryer,
Hannum, and other references. 2 Final Act. 16-18.

Appellants' Contentions 3
1. Appellants contend that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) because:

Hannum takes provided member preferences entered by the
viewer (strongly dislike, dislike, neutral, prefer and strongly
prefer) and appends numerical \veights (l-5) to them. Thus,
Hannum requires the user to provide preference input by the
user and simply applies a numerical representation to it. (See
paragraph [0032]). The Examiner fails to provide an
explanation of exactly how such user preference entry is to be
utilized within either Bell or Dryer. Nowhere in either Bell or

1

Separate patentability is not argued for claims 19, 22-24, 26, 27, 29, 30,
and 32. Except for our ultimate decision, these claims are not discussed
further herein.
2
Arguments are not presented for claims 21, 25, and 28. Therefore, our
decision as to claim 17 is determinative as to the rejection of claims 21, 25,
and 28. Except for our ultimate decision, these claims are not discussed
further herein.
3
This contention is determinative as to the rejections on appeal. Therefore,
Appellants' other contentions are not discussed herein.

Appeal2015-005891
Application 12/373,829
Dryer does a user provide such preference input which the
Examiner hinges his combination upon.

More relevantly, the rejection states:
"At the time of invention, it would have been
obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to
combine Bell device in light of Dryer and Hannum
teaching so that it may include rank each of the
plurality of items in accordance with the calculated
cumulative gaze durations of each of said plurality
of items and create at least one group related
products and associated the group with a weight,
rank each of the groups of related products, divide
each group into sub-groups which further ranked
and weighted to determine sets of ordered products
based on the weighted rankings." (See Page 4 of
the Office Action).
Problematically, while reciting the presently claimed
limitations, the rejection fails to support the location of such
elements nor provide a proper basis for such a significant
combination.
App. Br. 9, emphasis omitted and added.
2. Appellants further contend that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claim 17 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) because:
The Examiner, as well at Pg. 4 [of the Examiner's
Answer], indicates that Bell and Dryer do not expressly teach
"create at least one group of related products and associated the
group with a weight; rank each of the groups of related
products, divide each group into sub-groups which further
ranked and weighted to determine sets of ordered products
based on the weighted rankings of the subgroups." (See pg. 4,
first full paragraph, 11. 1-5).
The Examiner then cites in support of the three-way
combination, to Hannum. The Examiner states that Hannum
discloses creation of at least one group of related products and
division of each group into sub-groups.

4

Appeal2015-005891
Application 12/373,829
Hannum, however, on appropriate review, clearly
provides an embodiment wherein it is not the products that are
grouped but the members who are providing programming
choices to their system are each individually weighted so that
their preferences may be applied various weighting factors.

Reply Br. 3, emphasis added.

Issue on Appeal

Did the Examiner err in rejecting claim 17 as being obvious?

ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejections in light of Appellants'
arguments that the Examiner has erred.
As to Appellants' above contentions 1 and 2, in the Final Action at
pages 3--4, the Examiner cites to paragraphs 33-34 of Hannum as disclosing
the steps of:
[(a)] create at least one group of related products and associated
the group with a weight, [(b)] rank each of the groups of related
products, [(c)] divide each group into sub-groups which [are]
further ranked and weighted to determine sets of ordered
products based on the weighted rankings of the sub-groups
Appellants' above contentions 1 and 2 challenge these findings. We
conclude, consistent with Appellants' argument, there is insufficient
articulated reasoning to support the Examiner's findings. For example, the
Examiner has not sufficiently identified how Hannum teaches or suggests a
"group of related products" associated with a "group weight," let alone
"sub-groups which are further ranked and weighted." Therefore, we
conclude that there is insufficient articulated reasoning to support the

5

Appeal2015-005891
Application 12/373,829
Examiner's final conclusion that claim 17 would have been obvious to one
of ordinary skill in the art at the time of Appellants' invention.

CONCLUSIONS
(1) Appellants have established that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claims 17, 19, 21-30, and 32 as being unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103(a).
(2) On this record, these claims have not been shown to be
unpatentable.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejections of claims 17, 19, 21-30, and 32 are
reversed.

REVERSED
