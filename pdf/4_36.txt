REJECTIONS3
Claims 1 and 3 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as anticipated
by Sati. Claims stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as obvious as follows:
claim 5 is rejected over Sati in view of Tomisaki; claims 6–8 are rejected
over Sati in view of Nokita; claims 9, 11, and 13 are rejected over Mitschke
in view of Sati; and claim 11 is rejected over Mitschke in view of Sati and
further in view of Nokita.
BACKGROUND
Appellants submitted amendments to the Specification, claims, and
drawings on April 8, 2013, after final rejection of the claims by a Final
Action mailed February 6, 2013. The Examiner declined to enter the
amendments, stating that they raised new issues that would require further
consideration and/or search. Advisory Action mailed April 24, 2013.
Appellants then filed a Request for Continued Examination on May 3, 2013
in order to enter the amendments. Therefore, for the purposes of our
Opinion, we consider the Specification, claims, and drawings as amended.
OPINION
The Specification, as amended, describes a C-arm as “encompassing
an X-ray source and an image intensifier.” Amendment After Final 2.
Appellants filed a declaration under 37 C.F.R. § 1.132 by an orthopedic

The rejection of claims 1–3 and 5–8 under 35 U.S.C. ¶ 112, second
paragraph, were withdrawn by the Examiner in the Answer. Ans. 2. Claims
2 and 10 are objected to for informalities. Id. at 4.

surgeon that supports this description of a C-arm. Amiot Decl. Appellants
further direct us to Essenreiter et al., US 7,922,391 B2, as supporting that a
C-arm comprises an x-ray beam source and an x-ray light detector. App. Br.
4 (citing Essenreiter, col. 11, ll. 3–9). Finally, Appellants cite to other
portions of the Specification to confirm that “C-arm,” as used in the
Specification and claims, includes an x-ray source and an x-ray detector. Id.
at 5.
Rejection of claims 1 and 3 as anticipated
Independent claim 1 requires an x-ray detector to be separate from xray imaging equipment. App. Br. 12 (Claims App’x).
The Examiner identifies the gravity sensor (56) of Sati as the “x-ray
imaging equipment” of the claims, having found that the word “equipment”
is defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as “supplies or tools needed
for a special purpose” and that the gravity sensor serves as a tool for a
special purpose Ans. 5–6. Figure 1a of Sati is reproduced below:

Figure 1a of Sati illustrates a C-arm imaging apparatus and associated
devices. Id. at col. 4, ll. 24–25. In addition to gravity sensor (56), Sati
discloses a C-arm with an imaging source (30) and an imaging receptor (32).

5

Appeal 2015-002920
Application 12/918,020
Sati, col. 4, ll. 51–53. The imaging receptor (32) of Sati comprises an
imaging intensifier (36), a calibration plate (46), and the gravity sensor (56).
The Examiner contends that element 36 of Sati is the x-ray detector
required by claim 1, and is separate from the gravity sensor (56), which the
Examiner identifies as the claimed “x-ray imaging equipment.” Final Act.
15. On this basis, the Examiner finds that Sati anticipates claims 1 and 3.
During prosecution, pending claims must be given their broadest
reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification. In re Am. Acad.
of Sci. Tech. Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The words used in
a claim must be read in light of the specification, as it would have been
interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention. Id.
Given the amended Specification and other evidence cited by
Appellants, we find that the Examiner’s determination that “x-ray imaging
equipment,” as used in the claims, is the same as the gravity sensor of Sati is
unreasonable. The broadest reasonable interpretation of “x-ray imaging
equipment” consistent with the Specification, as amended, is that x-ray
imaging equipment in the claims comprises a C-arm with an x-ray source at
one end and an x-ray image intensifier at the opposite end. See App. Br. 8.
As applied to Sati, the x-ray imaging equipment comprises elements 22, 30,
and 36. See Sati Fig. 1a. Consequently, Sati does not disclose an x-ray
detector separate from x-ray imaging equipment.
We do not sustain the rejection of claims 1 and 3 as anticipated by
Sati.
Rejection of claims 5–8 as obvious
The Examiner rejected claims 5 and 6–8 in the Final Action as
obvious over Sati in combination with Tomisaki (claim 5) or Nokita (claims
6

Application 12/918,020
6–8). Final Act. 8–10. The Examiner did not discuss any of these claims in
the Answer. Appellants argue that neither Tomisaki nor Nokita remedy the
deficiencies in Sati. App. Br. 9. We agree with Appellants, and do not
sustain the rejections of claims 5–8 as obvious.
Rejection of claims 9, and 11–13 as obvious
With respect to independent claim 9, the Examiner finds that
Mitschke discloses “activating an x-ray detection in a radiation field
(column 4, lines 47–50) separate from an imaging equipment (1).” Final
Act. 10 (emphasis in original). The Examiner further explains that
activating x-ray detection is accomplished by x-ray detector 4 in Mitschke.
Id. at 16. Figure 1 of Mitschke is reproduced below:

Figure 1 of Mitschke is a schematic illustration of a medical
interventional apparatus showing, among other elements, C-arm x-ray
device (1), x-ray source (3), and x-ray receiver (4).
As is apparent in comparing Figure 1a of Sati and Figure 1 of
Mitschke, when identifying x-ray detector (4) as “separate from” imaging
equipment (1), the Examiner is not using a reasonable interpretation of “x7

Appeal 2015-002920
Application 12/918,020
ray detector,” “imaging equipment,” or both in light of the Specification.
Thus, neither Mitschke nor Sati discloses the claim 9 requirement of “X-ray
detection in a radiation field separate from an imaging equipment.” See
App. Br. 13 (Claims App’x).
Appellants further argue that Mitschke does not disclose “producing a
detection signal upon detecting an x-ray beam of a given intensity in the
radiation field,” “transmitting the detection signal to a CAS processor
system,” or “recording a positional relation between a patient and the
imaging equipment with the CAS [computer-assisted surgery] processor
system as a response to receiving the transmitted detection signal.” App. Br.
9–10. For each of these claim elements the Examiner depends on the x-ray
receiver of Mitschke as providing the detection signal. See, e.g., Final Act.
10–11. As discussed in relation to Sati, the Examiner’s interpretation of the
x-ray receiver as being responsible for x-ray detection in the claims is
inconsistent with how one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
invention would interpret the claims in light of the Specification.
Sati does not remedy these Mitschke deficiencies. Therefore, we do
not sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claim 9 as obvious over Mitschke in
view of Sati.
Like claim 9, dependent claims 12 and 13 are rejected as obvious over
Mitschke in view of Sati. For the reasons provided above regarding claim 9,
we do not sustain the rejection of claims 12 and 13.
Claim 1 is rejected over Mitschke in view of Sati and further in view
of Nokita. Because Sati and Nokita do not remedy the deficiencies of
Mitschke, we do not sustain the Examiner’s rejection of clam 11.
The Examiner’s Objections
8

Appeal 2015-002920
Application 12/918,020
The Examiner objected to Appellants’ April 8, 2013 Amendments to
the Specification as introducing new matter and Figure 1 for failing to show
an x-ray source. Ans. 3–4. The Examiner also objected to claims 2 and 10
for informalities. Id. at 4. The Examiner stated that these objections were
petitionable rather than appealable. Id. at 3–4. We decline to exercise
discretion to consider the Examiner’s objections. With regard to the new
matter objection, a corresponding rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first
paragraph, for lack of written description support has not been made and,
therefore, it is not appropriate for us to review the objection on appeal. See
MPEP § 2163.06 (II) (“If both the claims and specification contain new
matter either directly or indirectly, and there has been both a rejection and
objection by the examiner, the issue becomes appealable and should not be
decided by petition.”) (emphasis added).
DECISION
For the above reasons, the Examiner’s rejections of claims 1, 3, 5–9,
and 11–13 are reversed.
REVERSED
