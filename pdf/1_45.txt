Application 12/673,839
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants describe the present invention as a multi-component fiber
for use in, for example, clothes. Spec. 1:5--4:25. The fiber includes a phase
change material ("PCM") that helps regulate body temperature. Spec. 2:302:3. Claim 1, reproduced below with emphases added to certain key
recitations, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:
1.

A multi-component melt-spun fibre, comprising:

at least two elongated melt-spun fibre bodies, wherein a
first fibre body consists of a first material comprising a phase
change material (PCM) in raw form and a second fibre body
consists of a second material and encloses the first fibre body,
wherein the first material is a blend comprising the phase
change material and a viscosity modifier selected from
polyolefines having a density in the range of 890-970 kg/m 3 as
measured at room temperature according to ISO 1183-2 and a
melt flow rate in the range 0.1-60 g/10 minutes as measured at
190 °C with a 21.6 kg weight according to ISO 1133,
\vherein the PCl\1 is present in more than 65% by \veight,
calculated on the total weight of the first fibre body.
Appeal Br. 3 Claims Appendix - 1.
REJECTION
The Examiner rejects claims 1-24 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
unpatentable over Magill et al. (US 2005/0208300 Al, Sep. 22, 2005)
(hereinafter "Magill") in view ofVoortmans (WO 2007/065644 Al, June
14, 2007).

In this decision, we refer to the Final Office Action mailed October 9, 2013
("Final Act."), the Appeal Brief filed March 5, 2014 ("Appeal Br."), the
Examiner's Answer mailed May 8, 2014 ("Ans."), and the Reply Brief filed
July 7, 2014 ("Reply Br.").

ANALYSIS
Claim 1 recites "melt-spun fiber bodies" and "polyolefines having a
density in the range of 890-970 kg/m 3 . . . and a melt flow rate in the range
0.1---60 g/10 minutes .... " Appeal Br. Claims Appendix - 1. The Examiner
finds that Magill does not disclose the recited polyolefin. Final Act. 13. The
Examiner relies on Voortmans for teaching such a polyolefin. Id. at 14.
Appellants argue that a person of skill in the art would not have
combined Magill with Voortmans because Voortmans teaches a high density
polyethylene polymer that is not relevant to and would not work for meltspinning. Appeal Br. 7-8. Appellants support this position with the August
18, 2013, Declaration of Dr. Bengt Hagstrom (hereinafter "Hangstrom
Deel.") that explains in some detail why a person of skill in the art would
regard the polymer described by Voortmans as "useless for melt spinning of
textile fibers .... " Hangstrom Deel. ,-r 11. In particular, Dr. Hangstrom
testifies that the polyethylene of Voortmans would result in "fibers
break[ing] during the melt drawing process between the spinneret exit and
the take-off roller." Id. at i-f 10.
The Examiner states that the Hangstrom Declaration is unpersuasive
because Voortmans teaches it can be employed in the manufacture of "any
suitable article" including "fibers." Final Act. 5; Voortmans 11:26-31.
Voortmans, however, does not state that its polymer is suitable for meltspinning. The Examiner also finds that one Magill embodiment discloses
that the first polymeric material can include a mixture of low molecular
weight polymer and a high molecular weight polymer. Final Act. 5---6;
Magill i-f 91 (explaining that a high molecular weight polymer "has enhanced
physical properties ... but can have a high viscosity when heated to form a
3

Appeal2014-007838
Application 12/673,839
melt" and that mixing with a low molecular weight polymer can facilitate
manufacture). The Examiner finds that such a combination would have
enabled a Magill/Voortman' s combination suitable for melt spinning.
Id. at 6.

The Examiner's analysis is persuasive with respect to combining
Magill and Voortmans, but combining the two references is not the only
issue at hand. Claim 1 also recites "the PCM [phase change material] is
present in more than 65% by weight, calculated on the total weight of the
first fibre body." Appellants argue that a Magill/Voortmans combination
making use of a mixture of low molecular weight polymer and high
molecular weight polymer would not meet this recitation because Magill
teaches that Magill's embodiment having a mixture of a high and low
molecular weight polymers has only a small amount of temperature
regulating material. Appeal Br. 9. In particular, Magill describes that
"[a]ccording to some embodiments of the invention," the member includes
about 10 percent to about 30 percent temperature regulating material.
Magill i-f 92. In one preferred embodiment, the elongated member is 15
percent low molecular weight polymer, 70 percent high molecular weight
polymer, and 15 percent temperature regulating material. Id.
To address the 65% PCM recitation, the Examiner emphasizes
Magill's teaching that "[a]ccording to some embodiments of the invention,"
the elongated members can include "up to about 100 percent by weight of a
temperature regulating material" or can "include up to about 90 percent by
weight of a temperature regulating material." Magill i-f 80; Final Act. 12;
Ans. 7-8. The Examiner also finds that Magill teaches an embodiment
where Magill's temperature regulating material includes only phase change

4

Appeal2014-007838
Application 12/673,839
material in raw form. Ans. 6; Magill if 59 ("Here, a temperature regulating
material 62 includes a phase change material in a raw form (e.g., the phase
change material is non-encapsulated ... ). ") The Examiner thus finds that
Magill teaches or suggests greater than 65% phase change material. Final
Act. 12; Ans. 3-5.
The problem with the Examiner's analysis is that, to reach the
limitations of claim 1, a person of ordinary skill would have had to ( 1)
choose to employ Voortman's polymer in combination with Magill, (2)
choose to employ Magill's embodiment that employs both low and high
weight polymers so that Voortman's polymer could work in melt spinning,
and (3) choose to combine Magill's embodiment of teaching up to 90% or
up to 100% temperature regulating material while also (4) choosing to
combine Magill's embodiment where the temperature regulating material is
pure phase change material (or largely phase change material). While it is
true that all embodiments and even unpreferred embodiments in the prior art
must be considered in the obvious analysis (In re Lamberti, 545 F.2d 747,
750 (CCPA 1976), the Examiner does not identify adequate guidance from
Magill or provide other reasoning that would have led one of skill to this
particular combination over the myriad of other possibilities offered by
Magill. This is especially true because Magill, although far from clear, more
suggests that an embodiment employing both low and high weight polymers
would have had a lower percentage of temperature regulating material.
Appeal Br. 9; Magill if 92.
Therefore, while we appreciate the Examiner's reasoned efforts, we
do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1 based upon the present

5

Appeal2014-007838
Application 12/673,839
record. We also do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 2--4, 626, and 28 which each depend from claim 1.
Independent claim 5 has different recitations than claim 1. Claim 5
does not recite that "the PCM is present in more than 65% by weight."
Claim 5 recites, however, that the multi-component fibre comprises a first
material having a PCM efficiency ... of at least 82.9%. Appeal Br. Claims
Appendix - 2. Claim 5 also requires the high density polyolefin as recited in
claim 1.
The Examiner finds that PCM efficiency is directly correlated with the
amount of temperature regulating material is included in the first material,
and that the Magill/Voortmans combination having up to 90% phase change
material would have the recited PCM efficiency. Final Act. 11; Ans. 12-13.
As explained above, the present record does not adequately support that a
person of skill would have arrived at a combination of Magill and
Voortmans while also having a relatively high percentage of phase change
material. Thus, the record also does not support a combination of Magill
and Voortmans having the recited PCM efficiency. Appeal Br. 10.
We thus do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 5 or of claim
27 which depends from claim 5.
DECISION
For the above reasons, we reverse the Examiner's rejection of claims
1-28.
REVERSED
