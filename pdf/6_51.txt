Technology Center 2100

Before HUNG H. BUI, JOSEPH P. LENTIVECH, and
MICHAEL J. ENGLE, Administrative Patent Judges.
ENGLE, Administrative Patent Judge.
DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellant appeals under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from a final rejection of
claims 1-20. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.
Technology
The application relates to the migration of computer data. Abstract.
Claim 1 is illustrative and reproduced with the disputed limitation
emphasized below:
1. A method for migration of computer data comprising:
modifYing a volume boot record of a destination volume of
a disk to a first state in which at least a portion of the destination
volume becomes inaccessible to a standard file system while

maintaining a master boot record of the disk unmodified to
enable continued access to the disk using the master boot record;
writing one or more snapshots of a source volume to the
inaccessible portion of the destination volume while the volume
boot record is in the first state; and
restoring the volume boot record to a second state in which
the inaccessible portion of the destination volume becomes
accessible to the standard file system.
Examiners Rejections and References
Claims 1-3, 5-7, 9-12, and 14--20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as obvious over the combination of Bang (US 2008/0005527 Al;
Jan. 3, 2008) and Pawar et al. (US 2008/0155316 Al; June 26, 2008). Final
Act. 8.
Claims 4, 8, and 13 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
obvious over the combination of Bang, Pawar, and Childs et al. (US
2008/0046781 Al; Feb. 21, 2008). Final Act. 21.
Claims 1-9 and 11 stand rejected on the ground of nonstatutory
obviousness-type double patenting over claims 1, 2, 4--10, 12, and 13 of U.S.
Patent Application No. 13/481,671 in view of Pawar. Final Act. 4. The
present application is a continuation of the '671 application.
Claim 1-20 stand rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double
patenting over claims 1-19 ofU.S Patent No. 8,190,574. Final Act. 4. The
'671 application discussed above was a divisional of the application for the
'574 patent.

ANALYSIS

Obviousness-Type Double Patenting: Claims 1-20
A terminal disclaimer as to U.S. Patent App. No. 13/481,671 was filed
on July 31, 2014. We agree with Appellant that this moots the obviousnesstype double patenting rejection over the '671 application. We also note that
the '671 application has since been abandoned.
Appellant also asserts that a terminal disclaimer as to U.S. Patent No.
8, 190,57 4 was filed on July 31, 2014. App. Br. 9. However, we do not see
any such terminal disclaimer in the official record. Moreover, Appellant has
not challenged the substance of the obviousness-type double patenting
rejection based on the '574 patent other than alleging a terminal disclaimer
was filed. Given this record, we are not persuaded that this obviousnesstype double patenting rejection is moot.
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 1-20 for
obviousness-type double patenting over the '574 patent. See Final Act. 4.

Appeal2015-005014
Application 13/872,001

Obviousness: Claims 1-20
All of the independent claims ( 1, 11, and 18) recite "modifying a
volume boot record of a destination volume of a disk to a first state in which
at least a portion of the destination volume becomes inaccessible to a
standard file system."
The Examiner relies on Bang for teaching or suggesting this
limitation. Ans. 3--4. Bang "relates to the booting of a computer system"
where "more than one operating system is stored on the computer, and a user
selects the appropriate operating system to load during the booting
sequence." Bang i-fi-13, 5. Based on which operating system the user selects,
Bang teaches "address remapping" to convert requests for accessing one set
of data (e.g., the default operating system) to instead refer to a remapped
address (e.g., a different operating system selected by the user). Id. ,-r 6.
Bang teaches three modes of address remapping. In an "inactive"
mode, no changes to requests are made. Id. i-fi-135-36, FIG. 4A. In a
"swapping" mode, requests to a first partition get remapped to go to a
second partition, while requests to the second partition get remapped to the
first partition. Id. i-fi-137-38, FIG. 4B. "In essence, requests to access the
partition 402 and the partition 404 are swapped." Id. i-f 38. Finally, in an
"overriding" mode, requests to a first partition get remapped to a second
partition, but requests to the second partition are not changed. Id. i-fi-139--40,
FIG. 4C. Thus, the first partition "becomes inaccessible." Id. ,-r 40.
According to Bang, "[ w ]hen the computer system is again reinitialized or rebooted (S505), the user inputs a command to select an
operating system (S506). If the non-default operating system is selected

4

Appeal2015-005014
Application 13/872,001
(S507), address remapping is performed by the remapping application 320
using address swapping or address overriding (S508)." Id. i-f 42, FIG. 5.
The Examiner finds that in Bang, "override and reboot" will "disable
access to the partition." Ans. 3 (citing Bang i-fi-139--42, FIG. 5). The
Examiner further finds that "reboot/re-initialize modifies of [sic] the VBR
and changes the accessibility of the corresponding partition." Ans. 4.
However, no citation is provided for this finding.
Appellant first contends the term "volume boot record of a destination
volume of a disk" under the broadest reasonable interpretation "requires that
'the volume boot record' be stored on 'a disk."' App. Br. 6. We are not
persuaded. For example, a volume boot record storing information about a
destination volume of a disk could still reasonably be a "volume boot record
of a destination volume of a disk" despite being stored somewhere other
than the disk.
Nevertheless, we agree with Appellant that the Examiner "fails to cite
any specific portion of Bang that teaches any modification of the VBR
during reboot/re-initialize." Reply Br. 7. "[R]ejections on obviousness
grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements; instead, there
must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to
support the legal conclusion of obviousness." In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988
(Fed. Cir. 2006); KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007)
(quoting Kahn). "When a reference is complex or shows or describes
inventions other than that claimed by the applicant, the particular part relied
on must be designated as nearly as practicable." 37 C.F.R. § 1.104(c)(2).
Here, the Examiner has not sufficiently articulated why the volume
boot record would be modified upon reboot rather than Appellant's assertion
5

Appeal2015-005014
Application 13/872,001
that "Bang simply redirects requests ... as these requests are in transit to
the disk" and hence "the remapping application 320 does not modify the

actual disk 301 itself in any way." App. Br. 11.
Accordingly, we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of
independent claims 1, 11, and 18. Dependent claims 2-10, 12-1 7, 19, and
20 stand with their respective independent claims.
DECISION
For the reasons above, we affirm the Examiner's decision rejecting
claims 1-20 for obviousness-type double patenting over the '574 patent.
The Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1-9 and 11 for obviousness-type
double patenting over the '671 application is moot given the terminal
disclaimer. We reverse the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1-20 for
obviousness.
Since at least one rejection encompassing all claims on appeal is
affirmed, the decision of the Examiner is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.50(±).
AFFIRMED
