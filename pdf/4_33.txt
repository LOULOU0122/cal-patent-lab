STATEivIENT OF THE CASE

Introduction
Appellants' disclosed and claimed invention is generally directed to
compensating for propagation delay in a wireless communication system.
Spec. 1:6-7. 3
Claim 17 is representative and reproduced below (with the disputed
limitation emphasized):
17. A method of compensating for propagation delay in a
wireless communication system, wherein a processing unit in a
base station or in a N odeB is in communication with a first
plurality of antenna units being in wireless communication with
at least a first terminal, the first terminal having a terminal
antenna, the method comprising:
determining relative propagation delay associated with a
wireless channel from each of the first plurality of antenna units
to the terminal antenna of said first terminal, the first plurality
of antenna units being part of a distributed antenna system such
that the first plurality of antenna units are spatially separated
from each other andfrom the base station or the NodeB;
establishing a delay profile specific for the first terminal
using the determined relative propagation delays; and
compensating for the determined relative propagation
delay from each antenna unit to said first terminal by applying
the delay profile to a transmission between the processing unit
and said first terminal.

Our Decision refers to the Final Action mailed Apr. 8, 2014 ("Final Act.");
Appellants' Appeal Brief filed Sept. 5, 2014 ("App. Br."); the Examiner's
Answer mailed Dec. 16, 2014 ("Ans."); Appellants' Reply Brief filed
Jan. 30, 2015 ("Reply Br."); and, the original Specification filed
Oct. 20, 2010 ("Spec.").

Rejection on Appeal
Claims 17-19, 21-25, 28-33, 35-39, and 41--45 stand rejected under
35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as being anticipated by Burke et al. (US 7,155,231 B2;
issued Dec. 26, 2006) ("Burke"). Final Act. 3---6.

Issues
Appellants' arguments in the Briefs present us with the following
issues:
1.

Does Burke teach or suggest "the first plurality of
antenna units are spatially separated from each other
andfrom the base station or the NodeB," as recited in
claim 17, and as similarly recited in claim 31?

2.

Does Burke teach or suggest "evaluat[ing] phase
differences between propagation channels between said
first terminal and multiple antenna units, or between a
terminal in the second plurality of terminals and multiple
antenna units, for two different frequencies," as recited in
claim 23; and as similarly recited in claim 37?

ANALYSIS

Issue 1
Appellants argue the term "separated" means "Not joined or touching

physically." App. Br. 5 (citing Oxford Dictionary). Thus, according to
Appellants, the proper construction of the term "spatially separated" is "[ n ]ot

joined or touching physically in space." Id. Appellants also argue that, in
Burke, the antennas 1 lOA-1 lOM are not spatially separated from the base
station 104, but rather are physically connected to the base station 104. Id.
at 5---6 (citing Burke Figs. 2, 3; 4:7-8, 4:63, 5:1-5); Reply Br. 3--4. In the
Reply Brief, Appellants argue Burke does not teach that the first plurality of

3

Appeal2015-003935
Application 12/988,671
antenna units are part of a distributed antenna system, as recited in claims 17
and 31, but that Burke shows a traditional co-located antenna system in
which the antennas are mounted to the same base station. Reply Br. 4.
We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments that the Examiner has
erred. The Examiner finds the claimed "spatially separated" may include
wire links, e.g., optical or electrical, that allow for any separation in space.
Ans. 7 (citing Burke Fig. 4, 12:22-25). We agree with the Examiner's
interpretation, including because Appellants' Specification teaches antennas
physically spaced apart from the base station that may establish
communication with a processing unit of the base station via communication
links, such as high speed optical or electrical units. See, for example, Spec.
Fig. 3 (links 60 and 62), Fig. 4 (links 66, 68, 70), col. 12:6-24. The
Examiner also finds, and we agree, Burke teaches "in figure 2, the base
station 104 is connected to antennas 1 lOA-1 lOM via a link which can be a
wire/cable, [and, therefore] the antennas 1 lOA-1 lOM are spatially separated
from the base station 104 by the length of the wire/cable." Ans. 7. Thus, we
agree with the Examiner that Burke teaches "the first plurality of antenna
units are spatially separated from each other and from the base station or
the N odeB," as recited in claim 17, and as similarly recited in claim 31.

Regarding Appellants' argument that Burke does not teach the first
plurality of antenna units being part of a "distributed antenna system," we
note this argument was not raised in the Appeal Brief, but was raised for the
first time in the Reply. Because this argument is raised by Appellants for the
first time in the Reply Brief not in response to a shift in the Examiner's
position or without otherwise showing good cause, it is waived. See 37
C.F.R. § 41.41(b)(2) (2012); see also Ex parte Borden, 93 USPQ2d 1473,

Appeal2015-003935
Application 12/988,671
1474 (BPAI 2010) (informative) ("[T]he reply brief [is not] an opportunity
to make arguments that could have been made in the principal brief on
appeal to rebut the Examiner's rejections, but were not.").
For these reasons, we sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 17
and 31, as well as dependent claims 18, 19, 21, 22, 28-33, 35, 36, and 4145, which are not argued separately.
Issue 2

Appellants argue Burke does not teach or suggest "evaluating phase
differences between propagation channels ... for two different frequencies,"
as recited in claim 23 and similarly recited in claim 37. App. Br. 7. The
Examiner finds Burke teaches a CDMA system in which channel estimation
is performed on each channel/frequency of the received CDMA signal for
phase adjustment. Ans. 8 (citing Burke 3:25--44, 8:52-9:3, Fig. 12, channel
estimator 1265A). The Examiner also finds Burke teaches or suggests
"multipath time delay information may be obtained using the reverse link
(i.e., correlation in multipath time delay info between frequencies)" and
"therefore, the communicated CDMA signal contains two or more different
frequencies." Ans. 8 (citing Burke 18:35-37). In response, Appellants
argue that, although Burke teaches correlation in multipath time delay
information between frequencies and a phase adjustment for phase aligned
reception at the mobile station, Burke does not disclose evaluating phase
differences between propagation channels for two different frequencies.
Reply Br. 5 (citing Burke 18:51-52).
We are persuaded by Appellants' argument because Burke teaches
evaluating one channel, the reverse link, for correlating multipath time delay

Appeal2015-003935
Application 12/988,671
between channels. See Burke 18:38, 51-52. Thus, we do not sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claims 23 and 37.
DECISION
We affirm the Examiner's rejection of claims 17-19, 21, 22, 28-33,
35, 36, and 41--45 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
We reverse the Examiner's rejection of claims 23-25 and 37-39.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
