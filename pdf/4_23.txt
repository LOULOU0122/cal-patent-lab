PER CURIAM

DECISION ON APPEAL 1
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellants 2 appeal from the
Examiner's decision rejecting claims 11-24 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as

Our decision refers to the Specification (Spec.) filed July 28, 2009,
Appellants' Appeal Brief (Br.) filed November 27, 2013, and the Examiner's
Answer (Ans.) delivered April 3, 2014.

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is Texas Instruments
Incorporated. Br. 3.

Application 12/462,076
unpatentable over Han3 in view of Chi. 4 We have jurisdiction over the
appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
Upon consideration of the totality of the record including the evidence
and arguments of the Examiner in favor of obviousness and Appellants'
contentions to the contrary, we find that the preponderance of evidence on
this record supports the Examiner's conclusion that the subject matter of
Appellants' claims on appeal are unpatentable over the applied prior art. We
sustain the above rejection based on the findings of fact, conclusions of law
and rebuttals to arguments well expressed by the Examiner in the Non-Final
Office Action and the Answer. The Examiner's fact findings are set forth in
the Non-Final Office Action and the Answer which we adopt hereby as our
own without repetition. We add the following for emphasis.
Appellants argue that Han and Chi teach away from the use of
comparable voltages (Br. 10-11 ), and that Chi does not teach producing an
inversion region (id. at 12). In particular, Appellants argue that Han teaches
that the tunneling capacitor 206 5 and the coupling capacitor 202 are located
over the same well 234, and teaches application of a large voltage on
terminal T and ground on terminal B. Id. at 11. Appellants also argue that
Chi teaches "Vd=Vs=Vcc", that the "n-base surface is not inverted," and the
use of "edge FN tunneling" which is opposite to Appellants' Specification.

Application 12/462,076

Id. Appellants repeat these same or similar arguments for each of the
rejected claims. Id. at 10-34.
However, Appellants' arguments are without persuasive merit. As
the Examiner finds (Ans. 3), Han's tunneling and coupling capacitors do not
share the same well, but instead use of the same reference numeral to refer to
both wells is merely a matter of convenience as clearly depicted in Figure 2.
Further, while the Examiner acknowledges Han's teaching of the application
of a large voltage on one capacitor while grounding the other (id. 3--4), the
Examiner relies on Chi for suggesting the use of comparable voltages and
equates the applied voltage differences between Han and Chi (id. at 13).
Indeed, the Examiner explains that "[i]t is the biasing of Chi and not the
structure that is being incorporated [into Han's process]." Id. at 14.
Moreover, as the Examiner finds (id. at 14--15), Chi teaches the
accumulation of mobile electrons on the surface of the p+ junction, "which
is another way of saying that there is an inversion layer of electrons on the
surface of the p+ region consistent with both Appellant[s'] invention and
Han's device." Finally, as the Examiner finds (id. at 15), the claims do not
distinguish between FN tunneling and edge FN tunneling, and Chi teaches
the FN tunneling phenomena just as in Han. Appellants do not address or
otherwise rebut these findings regarding the respective teachings of Han and
Chi. As such, Appellants have not identified reversible error in the
Examiner's findings or conclusions of law with regard to the§ 103 rejection
based on the combination of Han and Chi.

DECISION
Upon consideration of the record, and for the reasons given above and
in the Answer, the decision of the Examiner rejecting claims 11-24 under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Han and Chi is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l).

AFFIRMED
