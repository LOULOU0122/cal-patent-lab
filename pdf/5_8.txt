FINDINGS OF FACT
We rely on the Examiner's factual findings stated in the Answer.
Additional findings of fact may appear in the Analysis below.

ANALYSIS
The rejection of claims 1-3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 22, and 24 under 35 U.S.C. §103(a)
as being unpatentable over Durst, Aldstadt, and Ehresmann.

We have reviewed the Appellants' arguments challenging the
rejection of independent claims 1 and 11 but do not find them persuasive as
to its error.
The Appellants have not argued that Durst, Aldstadt, and Ehresmann
fail to disclose a claim element. Accordingly, the Examiner's
characterization of the scope and content of the prior art or of the differences
between what the prior art discloses and the subject matter claimed do not
appear to be in dispute. Nor has any question been raised about the level of
skill of one of ordinary skill in the relevant art or whether the Examiner
presented an apparent reasoning with logical underpinning for combining the
cited references to reach the claimed combination. In view of these facts, we
find that a prima facie case of obviousness has been established.
The Appellants argue instead that hindsight reconstruction was used
to establish obviousness. "Obviousness can not be established by hindsight
combination to produce the claimed invention," In re Dance, 160 F.3d 1339,
1343 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See also KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 127 S. Ct.
1727, 1742 (2007) ("A factfinder should be aware, of course, of the
distortion caused by hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant

5

Appeal2014-000939
Application 12/775,731

upon ex post reasoning.") The Appellants do not make a persuasive
argument as to error in the rejection.
The Appellants point out that "Durst's postage meter is a stand alone
postage metering device that is not combined with any other mailing
machine" and then argue "that it is not apparent how or why Durst's stand
alone postage meter could be modified with the conventional sorting system
of Aldstadt." App. Br. 9. According to the Appellants "Durst does not teach
or suggest implementing its stand along postage device into a conventional
sorting system ... [and] Aldstadt fails to disclose or suggest implanting its
feeding, image reading and image processing features of a high speed
sorting system into a stand alone postage meter device." App. Br. 9-10.
Similarly, the Appellants point out that Ehremann discloses a
"franking machine (a type of postal fee billing system) [that] stamps mail
passing through it and computes the total charges." App. Br. 11. According
to the Appellants, "it is not clear what additional functions of Ehresmann are
necessary or obvious to include in Durst's machine. There is not apparent
reasoning for one of ordinary skill in the art when viewing Durst's machine
to have turned to Ehresmann for additional functionality." App. Br. 12.
We agree that there are "distinct differences" (App. Br. 10) between
the Durst, Aldstadt, and Ehresmann machines. But all three references are
directed to processing mail items and are thus within the field of the
inventors' endeavor. See In re Clay, 966 F.2d 656, 658-59 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
Moreover, the existence of "distinct differences" between the
machines disclosed is not dispositive of nonobviousness. "The obviousness
analysis cannot be confined by a formalistic conception of the words

6

Appeal2014-000939
Application 12/775,731

teaching, suggestion, and motivation, or by overemphasis on the importance
of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents." KSR at
1741. The question is whether "'the differences between the subject matter
sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a
whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a
person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter
pertains.'" KSR at 1734 (citing § 103). Here, the facts are not in dispute. It
is not disputed for example that the cited references variously disclose all the
claim elements. In that case, there is a "need for caution in granting a patent
based on the combination of elements found in the prior art" (KSR at 1739).
For over a half century, the Court has held that a "patent for a
combination which only unites old elements with no change in their
respective functions ... obviously withdraws what is already known
into the field of its monopoly and diminishes the resources available
to skillful men." Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket
Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162
(1950). This is a principal reason for declining to allow patents for
what is obvious. The combination of familiar elements according to
known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than
yield predictable results."
KSR at 1739.

We do not find that the Appellants have made the case that the
claimed subject matter is more than a combination of familiar elements each
performing its known function as evidenced by the prior art disclosures.
"[W]hen a patent "simply arranges old elements with each performing the
same function it had been known to perform" [(Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc., 425
U.S. 273, 282 (1976))] and yields no more than one would expect from such
an arrangement, the combination is obvious." KSR at 1740.

7

Appeal2014-000939
Application 12/775,731

In that regard, the Appellants have not come forward with sufficient
argument and/or evidence in support of finding that the combination yields a
result one of ordinary skill in the art would not have expected. No
secondary factors to support nonobviousness have been shown.
For the foregoing reasons, we are unpersuaded as to error in the
rejection of independent claims 1 and 11.
The rejection of claims 2, 3, 7, 9, 15, 22, and 24 is not separately
argued. Accordingly, the rejection of these claims is sustained for the same
reasons.

The rejection of claims 4 and 12 under 35 U.S.C. §103(a) as being
unpatentable over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and Borja.
The rejection of claims 5, 13, 17, 21, and 23 under 35 U.S.C. §103(a) as
being unpatentable over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and Orbke.
The rejection of claims 6 and 14 under 35 U.S.C. §103(a) as being
unpatentable over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and Rathbun.
The rejection of claims 16 and 25 under 35 U.S.C. §103(a) as being
unpatentable over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and Runstrom.
The rejection of claim 18 under 35 U.S. C. §103 (a) as being unpatentable
over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and Snapp.
The rejection of claim 19 under 35 U.S. C. §103 (a) as being unpatentable
over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and USPS.
The rejection of claim 20 under 35 U.S. C. §103 (a) as being unpatentable
over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and Paul.
The rejection of claims 31-34 under 35 U.S.C. §103(a) as being
unpatentable over Durst, Aldstadt, Ehresmann, and Pigos.

8

Appeal2014-000939
Application 12/775,731

The Appellants make the same argument against each of these
rejections; that is, given that claims 1 and 11 are patentable, so are the
claims dependent therefrom. See App. Br. 16-21. The argument is
unpersuasive for the reasons stated herein. Accordingly, these rejections are
sustained.

CONCLUSIONS
The rejection of claims 1-3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 22, and 24 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103 (a) as being unpatentable over Durst, Aldstadt, and Ehresmann is
