REJECTIONS AND PRIOR ART
The Examiner rejects claims 10-14 and 16 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)
as anticipated by Borchardt (US 6,575,628 Bl, iss. June 10, 2003).

2

Appeal2014-006114
Application 13/283,366
The Examiner rejects claim 15 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Borchardt and Armstrong (US 2005/0207679 Al, pub.
Sept. 22, 2005). See Answer 2--4.

ANALYSIS
Claim 10
With respect to the rejection of claim 10, Appellant argues that
Borchardt does not teach flanges spaced separately from fastener strips. See
Appeal Br. 5-7; see also Reply Br. 5-7. More specifically, Appellant argues
that "the expression 'spaced separately therefrom' must mean [that the
flanges are] positioned above or below the fastening strip elements, not just
next to the fastening strip on the bag wall. As such, Borchardt does not
teach this subject matter." Reply Br. 6. Even assuming that this argument is
timely raised, we disagree with Appellant.
Appellant does not provide a line of reasoning or point to evidence,
such as a statement in the Specification or an express limitation in the claim
sufficient to persuade us that claim 10 requires that the flanges must be
spaced above or below, as opposed to next to, the fastening strips. Thus,
based on the foregoing, we determine that the broadest reasonable
interpretation of the claim phrase "each of said flanges being disposed
parallel to said ... fastener strips but spaced separately therefrom," which is
consistent with Appellant's Specification, includes an arrangement in which
flanges are next to fastening strips. Inasmuch as the Examiner finds that
Borchardt teaches such an arrangement, and we determine that the
Examiner's finding is reasonable, we sustain the rejection of claim 10. See
Answer 2-3, 5. In particular, we agree with the Examiner that Borchardt's
3

Appeal2014-006114
Application 13/283,366
guide rails 139, 143 are spaced separately from fastening strips 130, 131, as
required by claim 10, because side walls 122, 123 are disposed between the
guide rails and fastening strips. See id.; see also Borchardt Fig. 4.
Appellant further argues that Borchardt does not teach flanges
retained within the slider. See Appeal Br. 7. Even assuming that this is
required by claim 10, we determine that the Examiner's findings regarding
Borchardt teaching such a slider are reasonable and supported by a
preponderance of the evidence. See Answer 5. For example, we agree with
the Examiner that "[a]lthough the rounded surface of the guided rails
provide a surface for pivoting as asserted by Appellant and shown in
[Borchardt's] FIGs[.] 14[-]16, the flanges 139, 143 are clearly contained
within the slider as readily apparent in [Borchardt's] [F]igures 19[-]23."
Answer 5. The fact that Borchardt's slider 132 pivots on guide rails 139,
143, as argued by Appellant, does not establish that slider 132 fails to retain
guide rails 139, 143. See Appeal Br. 7; see also Reply Br. 7.
Appellant argues that "[t]he rejection of claim 10 ... is improper
because the rejection does not include sufficient explanation of the cited
reference such that the disclosure of Borchardt is shown to disclose each and
every element of the rejected claim." Appeal Br. 8; see also Reply Br. 3--4.
We determine, however, that the Examiner provides a sufficient explanation
of how Borchardt teaches the limitations of claim 10. See Answer 2-3, 5;
see also Chester v. Miller, 906 F.2d 1574, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (35 U.S.C.

§ 132, which sets forth the minimal notice requirements for rejection, is
violated only "when a rejection is so uninformative that it prevents the
applicant from recognizing and seeking to counter the grounds for
rejection.").
4

Appeal2014-006114
Application 13/283,366
Thus, for the above reasons, Appellant does not show error in the
Examiner's anticipation rejection of claim 10. Therefore, we sustain the
rejection of claim 10.
Claims 11-14 and 16
With respect to claim 11, Appellant argues that the
[c]laim ... recites 'wherein the proximal and distal ends of each
of said fastener strips are ultrasonically sealed to each other.'
The Final Office Action alleges this subject matter is disclosed
by Borchardt at col[umn] 9, lines 48[-]51. This section of
Borchardt, however, relates to bonding the film of a bag to a
fastening strip and not to sealing the fastening strips to each
other.
Appeal Br. 9. The Examiner finds that
Borchardt discloses bonding of the fastening strips to the film
stock may be carried out either before or after the film is Ufo lded to form the bag (col. 9, Ins[.] 52[-]54). Therefore, it is
inherent that the fastening strips would be sealed to each other as
the sides of the bag would have to be sealed, thereby the ends of
the fastening strip also being sealed when the fastening strips are
bonded to the bag walls prior to sealing the sides.
Answer 5. The Examiner's findings are reasonable and supported by a
preponderance of the evidence. Further, Appellant does not argue against
the Examiner's inherency finding, and, thus, does not show that the
Examiner's finding is erroneous. Therefore, we sustain the rejection of
claim 11.
Regarding claim 12, Appellant argues that "the Final Office Action
has not met the minimum requirements for an anticipation rejection."
Appeal Br. 9; see also id. at 8; see also Reply Br. 5. This argument is not
persuasive, however, because we determine that the Examiner provides a
sufficient explanation of how Borchardt teaches the limitations of claim 12.
5

Appeal2014-006114
Application 13/283,366
See Answer 6; see also Chester at 1578. Therefore, we sustain the rejection

of claim 12.
Regarding claim 13, Appellant argues that "[fJeatures 240, 242 of
Borchardt, ... as seen in FIGs. 17 and 18[,] are not 'disposed on the bottom'
of a channel as recited in the claim." Appeal Br. 9. The Examiner finds,
however, that "the shoulder members 240, 242 of Borchardt extend
upwardly from the bottom of the channel formed by the sides 17 4, 176 with
gaps 270, 280 as seen in Figures 17 and 18." Answer 6. The Examiner's
finding is reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
Therefore, we sustain the rejection of claim 13.
Regarding claim 14, Appellant argues that "no structure, no feature,
and no portion of Borchardt is cited as disclosing this subject matter."
Appeal Br. 9-10; see also id. at 8; see also Reply Br. 5. Appellant advances
a similar argument for claim 16. See, e.g., Appeal Br. 8, 10. These
arguments are not persuasive, however, because we determine that the
Examiner provides a sufficient explanation of how Borchardt teaches the
limitations of each of claims 14 and 16. See Answer 6-7; see also Chester
at 1578. Therefore, we sustain the rejection of claim 14.
Claim 15
Appellant argues that the rejection is in error because Borchardt
discloses that slider 132 pivots on guide rails 139, 143, and the Examiner's
proposed modification based on Armstrong would result in substantially
rectangular guide rails. See Appeal Br. 10-11. The Examiner determines,
however, that the proposed combination would result in guide rails with a
substantially rectangular shape that is still rounded. See Answer 6-7.
Regardless, we determine that Appellant fails to establish that Borchardt
6

Appeal2014-006114
Application 13/283,366
may not be used in a combination that results in guide rails on which a slider
is unable to pivot. Further, even if we agree with Appellant that Borchardt
may not be modified so that a slider is unable to pivot on guide rails,
Appellant does not establish that the Examiner's proposed combination
results in such a device.
To the extent that Appellant is further arguing that there is no reason
to combine the references as proposed by the Examiner, in KSR, the
Supreme Court discussed circumstances in which a patent might be
determined to be obvious without an explicit teaching, suggestion, or
motivation provided by the prior art. See KSR Int 'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550
U.S. 398 (2007). In particular, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that "[t]he
combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be
obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results." KSR at 416.
Still further, the Court stated that when considering obviousness "the
analysis need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject
matter of the challenged claim, for a court can take account of the inferences
and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ."
KSR at 418. Additionally, "when a patent 'simply arranges old elements

with each performing the same function it had been known to perform' and
yields no more than one would expect from such an arrangement, the
combination is obvious." KSR at 417 (citing Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc., 425
U.S. 273, 282 (1976)). In this case, the Examiner's proposed modification
of Borchardt to have substantially rectangular guide rails, based on
Armstrong's teaching, amounts to the use of a known guide rail shape that
would provide a predictable result, inasmuch as the resulting device may be
expected to work in the same way as Borchardt' s device. Regardless, there
7

Appeal2014-006114
Application 13/283,366
is nothing on the record sufficient to convince us that the proposed
modification would provide an unpredictable result, or that the resulting
device would work in a different way that Borchardt's device.
Finally, Appellant argues that
[b ]ecause, in the Final Office Action, the Office fails to resolve
the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art either explicitly or
implicitly, the rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) are improper
under the statute, the M.P .E.P. and under binding Supreme Court
precedent. Reversal is appropriate where the Examiner makes the
legal determination of obviousness without basing such
conclusion on all three factual determinations set forth m
Graham v. John Deere Co.
Appeal Br. 12. We are not persuaded that the Examiner's failure to
explicitly reference the ordinary level of skill in the art requires reversal of
the rejection. Conversely, Appellant does not provide persuasive reasoning
showing that the Examiner's proposed combination of references would
have been beyond the level of ordinary skill in the art. Further, the

Examiner's findings and conclusions. Based on the foregoing, we sustain
