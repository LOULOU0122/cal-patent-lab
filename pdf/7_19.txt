Before DANIEL N. FISHMAN, KARA L. SZPONDOWSKI, and
AARON W. MOORE, Administrative Patent Judges.

SZPONDOWSKI, Administrative Patent Judge.
DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
Final Rejection of claims 23, 24, 27-30, 34, 35, and 38--41. Claims 1-22,
25, 26, 31, 32, 36, 37 have been cancelled. (App. Br. 16-19.) Claim 33 is
allowed and claims 42--44 are objected to as being dependent upon a
rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form,
including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.
(Final Act. 8.) We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

Application 13/942,317
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants' invention is directed to IPTV (Internet Protocol
Television) session management and, in particular, to handling and invoking
applications other than embedded applications that are locally installed in a
set top box. (Spec. 1, 11. 4--5, 25-27.) Claims 23 and 24, reproduced below,
are representative of the claimed subject matter:
23.

A session managing method, comprising:

registering, in a registration table, at least one Internet Protocol
Television (IPTV)-related application that can be invoked at a set top
box present in a home network such that the registration table
comprises a respective identifier of the at least one IPTV-related
application;
detecting an IPTV-related event requiring invocation of an
IPTV-related application at the set top box, comprising receiving an
unsolicited message from a global network connected to the home
network; and
selecting, based on the IPTV-related event, an IPTV-related
application registered in the registration table to be invoked during an
IPTV session, comprising:
extracting an application identifier from the unsolicited
message;
comparing the application identifier with identifiers of
IPTV-related applications registered in the registration table;
and
selecting the IPTV-related application registered in the
registration table based on the comparison.
24. The method of claim 23, further comprising invoking the IPTVrelated application selected from the registration table.

REJECTIONS
Claims 23, 24, 29, 34, 35, and 40 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103 (a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Slothouber (US
2006/0184989 Al; published Aug. 17, 2006) and Plotnick et al. (US
2003/0227567 Al; published Dec. 11, 2003).
Claims 27 and 38 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Slothouber, Plotnick, and Kwon et al. (US 2008/0111699
Al; published May 15, 2008).
Claims 28 and 39 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over the combination of Slothouber, Plotnick, Kwon, and Fan
et al. (US 2009/0070663 Al; published Mar. 12, 2009).
Claims 30 and 41 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over the combination of Slothouber, Plotnick, and Chauvel et
al. (US 6,369,855 Bl; issued Apr. 9, 2002).

ANALYSIS
After considering each of Appellants' arguments, we agree with the
Examiner. We refer to and adopt the Examiner's findings and conclusions
as set forth in the Examiner's Answer and in the action from which this
appeal was taken. (Ans. 9-14; Final Act. 2-9.) Our discussions will be
limited to the following points of emphasis.

Issue 1: Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of
Slothouber and Plotnick teaches or suggests "registering, in a registration
table, at least one Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)-related application
that can be invoked at a set top box" and "selecting, based on the IPTV-

Appeal2015-004488
Application 13/942,317
related event, an IPTV-related application registered in the registration table
to be invoked," as recited in independent claim 23 and commensurately
recited in independent claim 34?
Appellants contend the applications in Plotnick are already invoked
and, therefore, are not applications that "can be invoked" or are "to be
invoked." (App. Br. 10.) According to Appellants, "launching, or invoking,
an application is not the same as changing focus between already launched
or invoked applications." (App. Br. 9.)
We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments. Generally, unless an
applicant has clearly set forth a special definition of a disputed claim term in
the specification, we give the term its broadest reasonable interpretation in
light of the specification. See Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1316
(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane). Appellants do not explicitly define the term
"invoke" in the Specification, nor do Appellants provide a definition in the
Briefs. A general purpose dictionary defines "invoke" as "to cause, call
forth, or bring about." WEBSTER'S UNIVERSAL COLLEGE
DICTIONARY 432 (1997). We agree with the Examiner that Plotnick's
changing focus from one application to another teaches or suggests invoking
the application. (See Ans. 10.) As the Examiner finds, in Plotnick,
applications that do not have focus continue to run in the background, but do
not have access to all system resources. (Ans. 11, citing Plotnick i-f 26.)
When the application gains focus, system resources will be given to the
application. (Plotnick i-f 27; see also Ans. 11.) We agree with the Examiner
that such disclosure teaches or suggests an "application that can be invoked"
and an application "to be invoked," as recited in the claims.

4

Appeal2015-004488
Application 13/942,317
Moreover, we note Appellants' arguments that Plotnick's applications
are already invoked and, therefore, cannot be invoked, are inconsistent with
Appellants' Specification, which describes "[t]he registration table ...
provid[ es] a complete, relevant information source listing all active and
inactive applications ... that can be invoked in response to the detected

IPTV-related event." (Spec. 8, 11. 23-25, emphasis added.) In other words,
Appellants' Specification describes that active applications can be invoked.
Finally, in the Reply Brief, Appellants state "[a]bove and beyond the
items discussed in the Appeal Brief, other differences between claim 23 and
the cited references, Slothouber and Plotnick, will now be described."
(Reply Br. 2-3.) We find Appellants' ensuing arguments not based on any
new grounds of rejection in the Examiner's Answer. As a result, Appellants
have waived such untimely argument because Appellants have not shown
any good cause for the belated presentation. See Ex parte Borden, 93
USPQ2d 1473, 1474 (BPAI 2010) (informative) (Unless good cause is
shown, the Board is not required to address arguments in the Reply Brief
that could have been presented in the Appeal Brief.).
Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons we sustain the Examiner's 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) rejection of independent claims 23 and 34, and dependent
claims 27, 28, 30, 38, 39, and 41, which were not separately argued.

Issue 2: Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of

Slothouber and Plotnick teaches or suggests "invoking the IPTV-related
application selected from the registration table," as recited in dependent
claim 24 and similarly recited in dependent claims 29, 35, and 40?

5

Appeal2015-004488
Application 13/942,317
Appellants contend Plotnick does not teach or suggest a registration
table. (App. Br. 13). We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments and
agree with the Examiner that Plotnick' s storing a list of application programs
registered with the application launcher teaches or suggests a registration
table. (See Ans. 13; Plotnick i-f 24.)
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner's 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) rejection
of dependent claims 24, 29, 35, and 40.

DECISION
For the above reasons, the Examiner's rejection of claims 23, 24,
27-30, 34, 35, and 38--41 is affirmed.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
