Appellant 1 appeals under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
final rejection of claims 6-16, which constitute all the claims pending in this
application. Claims 1-5 have been cancelled. We have jurisdiction under

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

Introduction
Appellant's described and claimed invention relates generally to a
driver information system. Abstract.
Claim 6 is representative and reads as follows (with the disputed
limitation emphasized):
6.
A method for operating a driver information system
having a display screen, comprising:
providing a data-carrier holding device; and
providing a computer-readable data carrier adapted to be
held in the data-carrier holding device;
wherein:

the computer-readable data carrier associates
each of at least one single stored map datum with a
respective plurality ofplanar tiles formed by a
subdivision of a region; and
the association at least one of:
provides for duplicative display of the map
datum at each of a plurality of sections of the
display screen of the driver information system,
each section corresponding to a respective one of
the tiles with which the stored map datum has been
associated; and
is implemented by storing multiple
associations in the computer-readable data carrier,
each of the stored associations associating the
single stored map datum with a respective one of
the plurality of planar tiles.
Appeal Br. 6 (Claims App'x).

Application 12/308,340

Rejection on Appeal
Claims 6-16 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) as being
anticipated by Ashby et al. (US 6,081,803; issued June 27, 2000) ("Ashby").

Issue on Appeal
Appellant's arguments in the Appeal Brief2 and Reply Brief present us
with the following issue: does Ashby teach "the computer-readable data
carrier associates each of at least one single stored map datum with a
respective plurality of planar tiles formed by a subdivision of a region," as
recited in claims 6 and 8, and similarly recited in claim 9?

ANALYSIS
We are not persuaded by Appellant's arguments that the Examiner has
erred. Appeal Br. 3--4; Reply Br. 1-3. Unless otherwise indicated, we agree
with, and adopt as our own, the Examiner's findings and reasons as set forth
in the Final Action from which this appeal is taken (Final Act. 2-9) and the
Examiner's Answer (Ans. 2-3). For emphasis, we highlight specific
arguments and findings as follows.
Appellant argues claims 6, 8, and 9 each recite that a computerreadable data carrier associates each of at least one single stored map datum
with a respective plurality of planar tiles formed by a subdivision of a
region, and thus, the claims require at least one stored map datum, and

Our Decision refers to the Final Office Action (mailed Dec. 17, 2014,
"Final Act."), Appellant's Appeal Brief (filed Mar. 23, 2015, "Appeal Br.")
and Reply Brief (filed July 8, 2015, "Reply Br."), the Examiner's Answer
(mailed June 17, 2015, "Ans."), and the original Specification (filed Dec. 11,
2008, "Spec.").

further require each one of the at least one stored map datum to be
associated with a respective plurality of planar tiles. Appeal Br. 3--4; Reply
Br. 1-2. As argued by Appellant, Ashby describes point-of-interest ("POI")
data including one or more parcels, where a parcel includes one or more POI
data records, and where a parcel at most corresponds to a single rectangular
area, rather than a plurality of rectangular areas, which is the opposite of
what is recited in the claims. Appeal Br. 3--4; Reply Br. 1-2.
We do not find this argument persuasive. Neither Appellant's claims,
nor Appellant's Specification, defines the term "map datum." We agree
with the Examiner that Ashby teaches a geographical database configured to
collect and store POI data corresponding to a map, where the overall POI
data includes one or more POI parcels, and where each POI parcel includes
one or more POI data records representing points of interests. Final Act. 3;
Ans. 2-3 (citing Ashby, col. 11, 11. 40--47). Thus, Ashby's collection of POI
data teaches the claimed "map datum." We further agree with the Examiner
that Ashby teaches the geographical database collects and stores POI data
corresponding to a plurality of rectangular areas of the map, where each
parcel corresponds to one rectangular area of the plurality of rectangular
areas. Final Act. 3; Ans. 2-3 (citing Ashby, col. 11, 11. 40--47). Thus,
Ashby's geographical database associates the POI data with the plurality of
rectangular areas of the map. By collecting and storing each POI parcel
within the geographical database, the geographical database also associates
each POI parcel with the plurality of rectangular areas of the map. See
Ashby, col. 11, 11. 40--47. Thus, we also agree with the Examiner that Ashby
teaches "the computer-readable data carrier associates each of at least one
single stored map datum with a respective plurality of planar tiles formed by

4

Appeal2015-006833
Application 12/308,340
a subdivision of a region," as recited in claims 6 and 8, and similarly recited
in claim 9. Final Act. 3; Ans. 2-3.
Appellant's argument that a POI parcel corresponds to a single
rectangular area, rather than a plurality of rectangular areas, is unpersuasive
because the term "map datum" is sufficiently broad to read on the overall
POI data, rather than the individual POI parcel. Further, even assuming
arguendo that the tern "map datum" is limited to the individual POI parcel,

by teaching that the overall POI data is associated with the plurality of
rectangular areas, Ashby also teaches that each individual POI parcel is also
associated with the plurality of rectangular areas.
Therefore, for at least the reasons described above, we sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claims 6, 8, and 9, as well as claims 7 and 10-16,
which are not argued separately.

DECISION
We affirm the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 6-16 under
35 U.S.C. § 102(b).
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
