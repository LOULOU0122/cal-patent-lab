DECISION ON APPEAL

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from the rejection of claims
102, 104, and 107. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

Appeal2013-000667
Application 12/316,446
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claim 102, which is representative of the claimed subject matter, is
reproduced below:
102. A nuclear fission reactor comprising:
a burning wavefront heat generating region of a nuclear
fission reactor, the burning wavefront heat generating region
being configured to initiate and propagate a propagating nuclear
fission deflagration wave;
a condensed phase density fluid heat absorbing material
flowable in thermal contact with the burning wavefront wave
heat generating region; and
a heat extraction region substantially out of thermal
contact with the burning wavefront heat generating region.

appeal is:

REJECTIONS
Claims 102, 104, and 107 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as
being unpatentable over Teller and Baxi or Kingston.

Application 12/316,446
DISCUSSION
Appellants argue claims 102, 104, and 107 together. See Appeal Br.
28-81. We select independent claim 102 as the representative claim, and
claims 104 and 107 stand or fall with claim 102.
The Examiner finds that Teller discloses all of the limitations of claim
102 "except for condensed phase density fluid heat absorbing material."
Final Act. 3. 1 The Examiner further finds that "Baxi teaches that for fast
reactors, either liquid metal such as liquid sodium or a gas such as carbon
dioxide or helium can be used as core coolant" and that "Kingston et al. also
teach that for a fast reactor, a gas such as helium or a liquid metal such as
mercury, sodium, alloys of sodium and potassium, lead-bismuth alloys and
bismuth, can be used as core coolant." Final Act. 4 (citations omitted).
Based on these findings, the Examiner determines that it would have been
obvious
to modify the apparatus, as disclosed by Teller et al., by the
teaching in either one of Baxi or Kingston et al. to use liquid
metal instead of helium for the heat absorbing material, because
such modification is no more than the substitution of one coolant
material for a fast reactor with another well known coolant for
said fast reactor.

Id. at 4--5.
As an initial matter, we do not address Appellants' citations to case
law which may or may not accurately represent current law or be relevant to
this Appeal. Appeal Br. 5-28. Each case must be decided on its own merits.

The Final Action from which this Appeal is taken as well as the Answer
both refer to the Final Action mailed May 5, 2011, as setting forth the
rejection. Accordingly, we refer to the May 5, 2011, Final Action
throughout this Decision.

Appeal2013-000667
Application 12/316,446
Appellants' restatement of the rejections. As noted supra, we refer to the
Final Action mailed May 5, 2011.
Appellants contend that the Examiner fails to set forth a prima facie
case of obviousness because
(i)
(ii)

(iii)

(iii)

Teller et al. teaches away from making the proposed
modification;
the proposed modification of the Teller et al. reference
renders the Teller et al. reference unsatisfactory for its
intended purpose;
the proposed modification of the Teller et al. reference
changes the principle of operation of the Teller et al.
reference; and
it is not obvious to try to make the proposed modification.

Appeal Br. 29. Appellants' arguments in support of these contentions are
voluminous and repetitive. See Appeal Br. 29-81; see also Reply Br. 2-13. 2
We address each of the enumerated contentions once and do not address
further iterations of the same argument.
Appellants' first argument is that Teller teaches away from the
proposed modification. See, e.g., Appeal Br. 29. However, Appellants do
not identify where Teller "criticize[s], discredit[s], or otherwise
discourage[s]" the use of liquid metal. See In re Fulton, 391 F.3d 1195,
1201 (Fed. Cir. 2004). We will not read into a reference a teaching away
from a proposed combination when no such language exists. See Dystar
Textilfarben GmbH & Co. Deutschland KG v. C.H. Patrick Co., 464 F.3d

1356, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Thus, Appellants' argument is unconvincing.

In accordance with 37 C.F.R. § 41.41 (b)(2), lacking a showing of good
cause, we do not consider the arguments raised in the Reply Brief which are
not responsive to an argument raised in the Answer.

Appeal2013-000667
Application 12/316,446
Appellants' second argument is that the proposed modification would
render Teller unsatisfactory for its intended purpose. See, e.g., Appeal
Br. 29. In support of this argument, Appellants contend that Teller's
intended purpose is to provide a reactor which "must not and cannot be
accessed by human maintenance personnel for any reason whatsoever," and
which "function[s] fully automatic[ally] and obviously safe from all types of
human error" because it is constructed underground." Appeal Br. 66, 70.
Appellants explain that the proposed modification would make the reactor
subject to ASME Section XI, Division 3 Rules for Inspection and Testing of
Components of Liquid-Metal Cooled Plants, which require inspections, and
that such inspections could not take place as Teller's reactor is inaccessible.
See id. However, Appellants do not explain why Teller's reactor would not

work as intended if the helium is replaced with liquid metal. The fact that
such a reactor would not comply with ASME rules is inapposite as ASME
rules are subject to change. The fact that a reactor in accordance with the
proposed modification might require a change in ASivIE rules does not
render that reactor unsatisfactory for its intended purpose of generating
power. Appellants present no evidence or persuasive argument that use of
liquid metal would prevent Teller's reactor from being constructed
underground and fully automatic and obviously safe from all types of human
error. Thus, Appellants do not apprise us of error.
Appellants further argue that the proposed modification would render
Teller unsatisfactory for its purpose of being a fundamentally new design of
a nuclear power reactor. See Appeal Br. 69. Appellants' argument is
disingenuous. Being a fundamentally new design is a description of Teller's
reactor, not a purpose of Teller's reactor.

Appeal2013-000667
Application 12/316,446
Appellants' third argument is that the proposed modification changes
the principle of operation of Teller's reactor. See Appeal Br. 73. Again,
Appellants' argument is based on the contention that the proposed
modification will make Teller's reactor subject to inspection per ASME
rules. See Appeal Br. 74-7 6. However, as discussed supra, this argument is
not on point. Appellants do not explain why replacing Teller's helium with
liquid metal would cause Teller's reactor to operate in a different manner.
Rather, as noted by the Examiner (Final Act. 4), Teller explicitly teaches that
other heat absorbing materials can be used. See Teller p. 36. Thus,
Appellants do not apprise us of error.
Appellants' fourth and final argument is that it would not be obvious
to try other coolants in view of Baxi or Kingston. See Appeal Br. 76.
Appellants' argument is not persuasive because the rejection does not rely
upon an "obvious to try" rationale. See Final Act. 4. Rather, as discussed
supra, Teller explicitly teaches the use of other coolants and the rejection

relies upon a simple substitution rationale. Id. Thus, Appellants do not
apprise us of error.
For these reasons, we sustain the Examiner's decision rejecting claim
102, and claims 104 and 107, which fall therewith.
DECISION
The Examiner's rejection of claims 102, 104, and 107 is AFFIRMED.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.
§ 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
AFFIRMED
