DECISION ON APPEAL

Application 12/533,985
STATEivIENT OF THE CASE
This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's Final
Rejection of claims 1-30, which are all the claims pending in the
application. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We affirm.

Illustrative Claim
1.

A coding method, comprising:

decoding a stored sequence of first coded video data to generate
recovered video data therefrom, the first coded video data having been
generated according to a first video coding protocol; and
coding the recovered video data into second coded video data
according to a second video coding protocol,
wherein, during the coding of the second coded video data, a
coding parameter is selected based on metadata representing one or
more conditions during capture of source video from which the first
coded video data was generated, the source video and the metadata
having been generated by an image-capture system.

ANALYSIS
We adopt the findings of fact made by the Examiner in the Final
Rejection and Examiner's Answer as our own. We concur with the
conclusions reached by the Examiner for the reasons given in the
Examiner's Answer. We highlight the following for emphasis.

Appeal2015-000852
Application 12/533,985
Section j03 rejection of claims j, 4, 9, j2, j5, j/-j9, 25, and 28

Appellants contend Kuhn does not teach "metadata representing one
or more conditions during capture of a source video," as recited in claim 1.
Reply Br. 2. The Examiner finds the feature points shown in Figure 3 of
Kuhn teach "representing one or more conditions," such as camera shot
changes and scene changes, which happen "during capture of a video
source" within the meaning of claim 1. Ans. 6-7. Appellants contend the
feature points of Kuhn do not represent one or more conditions during
capture of a source video, because the feature points are generated during
encoding. Reply Br. 2--4. Appellants' contention is not commensurate with
the scope of the claim. Claim 1 recites the metadata represents a condition
during capture, not generating the metadata during capture. Appellants do
not persuasively distinguish the claimed metadata representing a condition
during capture from the metadata that represent a scene change, which is a
condition that happens during capture of video, as taught by Kuhn.
Similarly, we highlight the motion vectors generated by cameras 111 and
112 as shown in Figure 1 and as discussed in column 4, lines 17-34 of Kuhn
teach metadata that represent the conditions of motion that happen during
video capture.
Appellants also contend the metadata generated by Kuhn is not
"generated by an image-capture system," as recited in claim 1. Reply Br. 4.
In particular, Appellants' contend that the transcoding hints generation unit
104 shown in Figure 1 of Kuhn, which generates metadata, does not also
capture video. See Reply Br. 5. The Examiner finds the scope of the
claimed "image-capture system" encompasses the system 100 shown in
Figure 1 of Kuhn. Ans. 7-8. Appellants' contention does not persuasively

Appeal2015-000852
Application 12/533,985
rebut the Examiner's finding that the system 100, which includes
transcoding hints generation unit 104, along with cameras 111 and 112, is a
system that captures images and generates metadata for the images within
the meaning of claim 1. We agree with the Examiner that the scope of the
claimed "image-capture system" encompasses the system 100 shown in
Figure 1 of Kuhn.
We sustain the rejection of independent claim 1, as well the rejection
of commensurate independent claims 17 and 25, and dependent claims 4, 9,
12, 15, 18, 19, and 28, not separately argued, under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

Section 103 rejections of claims 2, 3, 5--8, 10, 11, 13-16, 20--24, 26, 27, 29,
and 30

Appellants do not present arguments for separate patentability of
claims 2, 3, 5-8, 10, 11, 13-16, 20-24, 26, 27, 29, and 30, which fall with
claims 1, 17, and 25.
We sustain the rejections of claims 2, 3, 5-8, 10, 11, 13-16, 20-24,
26, 27, 29, and 30 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejections of claims 1-30 are affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv). See
37 C.F.R. § 41.50(f).
