STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Introduction

Appellants' invention relates "generally to eye tracking technologies,
and more particularly to precision eye tracking through use of relative iris
edge based landmarks in eye geometry." (Specification (Apr. 8, 2008)
("Spec.") i-f 3.) Claim 1 is illustrative, and is reproduced below:
1. A method of identifying at least one landmark in the eye

comprising the steps of:
digitizing an image of the eye;
identifying at least a portion of the edge of the iris from
the digitized image of the eye; and
calculating a centroid of an area defined by the identified
edge portion of the iris wherein the centroid forms at least one
landmark in the eye.

Application 12/420, 111
ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejections in light of Appellants'
arguments 1 that the Examiner has erred. We are persuaded that the
Examiner erred in rejecting claims 1-4 and 6--20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
We affirm the Examiner's 35 U.S.C. § 112(d) rejection with regard to claim
17.
Claims 1-4 and 6-20
Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. § 103

Claim 1 recites "identifying at least a portion of the edge of the iris
from the digitized image of the eye; and calculating a centroid of an area
defined by the identified edge portion of the iris wherein the centroid forms

at least one landmark in the eye." The Examiner finds that Steinert teaches
or suggests "calculating a centroid of an area defined by the identified edge
portion of the iris" but "Steinert does not explicitly teach identifying at least
a portion of the edge of the iris from the digitized image of the eye." (Final

Act. 4.) However, according to the Examiner, Bickert teaches or suggests
the limitation and "[i]t would be obvious to one or ordinary skill in the art to
modify Steinert to include" the teachings of Bickert. (Id.) Appellants
contend that the combination of Steinert and Bickert actually teaches away
from the claimed invention because Bickert's technique (for "identifying at
least a portion of the edge of the iris") is based on an approximation of a

As an initial matter, we remind Appellants that under 37 CPR 1.3,
"Applicants and their attorneys or agents are required to conduct their
business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office with decorum
and courtesy [and c]omplaints against examiners and other employees must
be made in correspondence separate from other papers." (See, e.g., Reply
1.)

Application 12/420, 111
circle, which according to Appellants, goes against the teachings of the
Specification. (App. Br. 12-13.) The Examiner does not dispute that
Bickert teaches or suggests "circular approximation" but states that the
rejection is appropriate based on the broadest reasonable interpretation of the
claim language. (Ans. 17.) Appellants respond that the Examiner erred
because the claim language ("the area defined by the identified edge portion
of the iris") clearly does not allow approximation. (Reply 1-2, emphasis in
original.)
We agree with Appellants that the Examiner's interpretation is not
reasonable. When construing claims, a court must begin by "look[ing] to the
words of the claims themselves ... to define the scope of the patented
invention." Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005)
(en bane). However, "claims must be read in view of the specification, of
which they are a part." Id. at 1315 (internal quotations omitted). Hence, the
specification "is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.''
Id. Importantly, "[i]n examining the specification for proper context,
however, this court will not at any time import limitations from the
specification into the claims." CollegeNet, Inc. v. Apply Yourself, Inc., 418
F.3d 1225, 1231 (Fed.Cir.2005). The limitations at issue recite "identify at
least a portion of the edge . . . and calculating a centroid of an area defined
by the identified edge .... " It is clear from the claim language that the
identified portion of the edge and the calculation based on the identified
edge is not based on an approximation. This reading is supported by the
Specification, which states that the claimed invention has advantages over
prior art because it is not based on calculating the centroid of the pupil by
approximating a circle of the pupil:

Appeal2015-005074
Application 12/420, 111
[0018] As discussed above, most eye tracking devices digitize an
image of the, define the pupil using the high contrast difference
between the pupil and the rest of the eye, and then define the
center of the pupil by approximating a circle of the same size or
calculating the centroid of the pupil itself For relatively largescale eye movements, such as saccades and nystagmus, this
method is appropriate despite of the fact that the pupil changes
in size and, to a lesser degree, shape. However, greater accuracy
or even resolution in monitoring the movement of the eye can be
gained by digitizing the eye, and tracking the movement of a
landmark with fixed size and a fixed location relative to the eye's
local coordinate system.
[0020] The concepts of the present invention can be explained in
connection with figures 1-2. In these figures the wide variation
in the pupil size (and shape) will illustrate that the pupil
monitoring methods results in a certain amount of error. The
pupil center is established typically by approximating the shape
as a circle, and, the center of the circle (the assumed center of
the eye), in theory remains unchanged as the circle expands in
diameter. Due to changes in pupil diameter. lfowever these are
merely approximations that lead to noise in the system that
prevents the system from identifYing small eye movements, such
as micro-tremors.

(Spec., i-fi-f 18, 20, emphasis added.) As discussed above, because the
Examiner does not dispute that the cited portions of Bickert teaches or
suggests "circular approximation," (Ans. 17), and in light of our above
discussions, we are persuaded of Examiner error in the rejection of claim 1. 2
Independent claims 3 and 12 recite substantively similar limitations:
2

Because we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection for the reasons
discussed herein, we need not address Appellants' further arguments. See
Beloit Corp. v. Valmet Oy, 742 F.2d 1421, 1423 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (finding an
administrative agency is at liberty to reach a decision based on "a single
dispositive issue").

Appeal2015-005074
Application 12/420, 111
"identifying at least a portion of the edge of the iris ... establishing ...
based upon the identified portion of the edge of the iris." The Examiner also
relies on the same portions of Steinert and Bickert with respect to these
limitations of claims 3 and 12. Thus, we are persuaded that the Examiner's
rejections of claims 3 and 12 are deficient for the same reasons discussed
above with respect to claim 1. For the foregoing reasons, we do not sustain
the 35 U.S.C. § 103 rejection of claims 1, 3, and 12, as well as claims 2, 4,
6--11, and 13-20, which depend on either claims 1, 3, or 12.
Claim 17
Rejection Under 35 U.S.C. § 112

The Examiner rejects claim 17 under 35 U.S.C. 112(d) because the
"claim claims the same limitations as claim 2, which it depends from, with
no limiting limitation." (Final Act. 2-3.) Appellants do not respond. We
are not persuaded of Examiner error in the rejection of claim 17 and
therefore sustain the 35 U.S.C. 112 rejection of claim 17.

DECISION
We reverse the decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1--4 and 6--20
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). We affirm the decision of the Examiner to reject
claim 17 under 35 U.S.C. § 112(d).
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
