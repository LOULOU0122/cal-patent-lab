Application 12/632,943
REJECTIONS 1
Claims 2, 3, and 5-21 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
being unpatentable over Langfahl and Basir (Non-Final Act. 7-17).
Claim 4 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Langfahl, Basir, and Murphy (Non-Final Act. 17-18).

ISSUES
We disagree with Appellants' conclusions and adopt as our own:
( 1) the findings and reasons set forth by the Examiner in the action from
which this appeal is taken; and (2) the reasons set forth by the Examiner in
the Answer in response to the Appeal Brief. With respect to the claims
argued by Appellants, we highlight and address specific findings and
arguments for emphasis as follows.

35 U.S.C. § 103(a): Claims 2, 3, and 5-21

Appellants assert their claimed invention, as recited in claim 2, is not
obvious over Langfahl and Basir (App. Br. 8-13). The issues presented by
the arguments are:
Issue 1 a: Has the Examiner erred in finding the combination of

Langfahl and Basir teaches or suggests "in response to an occurrence of a
first event and a nonoccurrence of a second event, transfer at least a portion
of the video data from the buffer to the memory device," as recited in
independent claim 1 and similarly recited in independent claims 9 and 16?
1

The rejection of claims 2, 7, 9, 14, 16, and 21 on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting, as being unpatentable over
claims 1 and 12 of Kreiner, has been withdrawn by the Examiner (Ans. 910).

Appeal2015-003104
Application 12/632,943

Issue 1b: Has the Examiner erred in finding the combination of
Langfahl and Basir teaches or suggests "wherein the second event is an
authorization event," as recited in dependent claim 11?

ANALYSIS
Appellants argue Langfahl does not teach "nonoccurrence of a second
event," rather, Langfahl only teaches capturing video data in response to
occurrence of a first event (App. Br. 10). More specifically, Appellants
contend Langfahl teaches some action to be taken when an event occurs, but
does not describe the action is taken in response to a nonoccurrence of a
second event (id. at 10-11). According to Appellants, even in Langfahl's
"failsafe mode," Langfahl teaches the camera captures images at various
intervals and indeed, Langfahl always capture images without determination
of an "occurrence of a first event and a nonoccurrence of a second event"
(id. at 11 ). Appellants assert the security response and the emergency

response are not the claimed two events because both involve capturing and
sending the video data (id.).
Appellants argue the Examiner is reading the limitation "and a
nonoccurrence of a second event" out of the claim (Reply Br. 4). Appellants
additionally argue although where the camera is pointed may change
between security responses and emergency response, video data is stored
regardless (id.). Specifically, Appellants assert, as shown in Langfahl's
Figures 5 and 6, regardless of whether a security or emergency response is
triggered, Langfahl's system receives and transmits images regardless of
which response is triggered (id.).

4

Appeal2015-003104
Application 12/632,943
We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments. Initially, we note
the term "event" is not defined explicitly in Appellants' Specification.
Claim 2 recites transferring at least a portion of the video data upon
occurrence of a first event and a nonoccurrence of a second event -

not that

video data is only recorded or transferred upon occurrence of a first event
and a nonoccurrence of a second event. Indeed, claim 2 does not preclude
recording or transferring video even if both events occur.
Thus, in light of the broad, but reasonable, interpretation of "event,"
we are not persuaded Langfahl fails to teach the disputed limitation. Rather,
we find, as set forth by the Examiner, Langfahl discloses two events: a
security event and an emergency event (Ans. 10; Langfahl 3:30-47, 5:606:4). Langfahl further teaches a motion sensor, door sensors, a hood sensor,
and a trunk sensor are used in triggering an alarm to indicate a security
event, turning the imaging device toward the security event, and recording
the event (Langfahl 3:30-52). Langfahl additionally teaches a frontal
sensor, a rear sensor, and an airbag sensor are used to indicate an emergency
event, turning the imaging device toward the emergency event, and
recording the event (id. at 3:53--4:12). The security event sensors are
connected to an alarm which is connected to a control unit, and the
emergency sensors are connected to the control unit (id. at 3:30-33, 3:5361, Fig. 3). The control unit distinguishes the type of response by
determining which sensor has been triggered (id. at 4:21-24).
We further agree with the Examiner that Langfahl teaches "in
response to an occurrence of a first event and a nonoccurrence of a second
event transfer at least a portion of the video data" because Langfahl
discloses when the alarm is triggered by one of the sensors, the triggered

5

Appeal2015-003104
Application 12/632,943
alarm is detected by the control unit which determines if a false trigger has
occurred (Ans. 13; Langfahl 5:60-61). Thus, we determine Langfahl
teaches, or at least suggests, if the control unit determines a false trigger has
not occurred, then a second event has not occurred and the first event
(security event) has occurred.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments and
determine the combination of Langfahl and Basir teaches "in response to an
occurrence of a first event and a nonoccurrence of a second event,
transferring at least a portion of the video data," as recited in claim 2.
We further note the claim language is broad enough to cover, for
example, occurrence of a security event (first event) and nonoccurrence of
the camera system or computer system failing (second event).
Similarly, claim 9 recites "determining that the first event has
occurred" and "determining that a second event has not occurred." For the
reasons set forth with respect to claim 2, we also find the combination of
Langfahl and Basir teaches the disputed limitation. Specifically, Langfahl
teaches a first event occurring and determining whether a false trigger has
occurred (Ans. 13; Langfahl 5:60-61). Thus, if a false trigger is determined
to not have occurred, at least a portion of the video data is transferred.
Lastly, claim 16 recites "determining that the first event has occurred
and that a second event associated with the first event has not occurred."
For the reasons set forth with respect to claims 2 and 9, we are not persuaded
of error in the Examiner's findings or reasoning.
With respect to claim 11, Appellants argue Langfahl does not disclose
"wherein the second event is an authorization event" (App. Br. 15).
According to Appellants, Langfahl' s emergency event is triggered by a

6

Appeal2015-003104
Application 12/632,943
bumper or airbag sensor; however, Appellants argue the "emergency event"
is not an "authorization event" (id.).
Appellants have not persuaded us of error in the Examiner's findings
and reasoning (Ans. 18; Final Act. 12). Initially, as a matter of claim
construction, we determine the term "authorization event" is not defined
explicitly in Appellants' Specification. The Examiner finds Langfahl' s
security breach teaches a first event and an emergency event (an authorized
event) teaches a second event (Ans. 18). Taking a broad, but reasonable
interpretation of the term "authorization event," we agree with the Examiner
that an emergency event is an authorization event. Therefore, it follows, we
are not persuaded the Examiner erred in finding the combination of Langfahl
and Basir teaches the disputed limitation.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded the Examiner erred in finding the
combination of Langfahl and Basir teaches or suggests the limitations as
recited in independent claims 2, 9, and 16, dependent claim 11, and
dependent claims 3, 5-8, 10, 12-15, and 17-21, not separately argued.
Therefore, we sustain the rejection of claims 2, 3, and 5-21 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) for obviousness over Langfahl and Basir.

35 U.S.C. § 103(a): Claim 4

Appellants assert the claimed invention as recited in claim 4, is not
obvious over Langfahl, Basir, and Murphy (App. Br. 17-18). The issue
presented by the arguments is:
Issue 2: Has the Examiner erred in concluding the combination of

Langfahl, Basir, and Murphy teaches or suggests "wherein the second event

7

Appeal2015-003104
Application 12/632,943
is a presence of a token indicating that the attempted vehicle entry is
authorized," as recited in claim 4?

ANALYSIS
With respect to claim 4, Appellants contend the combination of
Langfahl, Basir, and Murphy fails to teach "wherein the second event is a
presence of a token indicating that the attempted vehicle entry is authorized"
(App. Br. 13-15). Appellants admit Murphy teaches "the use of 'a token,
presented by a would-be vehicle driver, containing personal information'
which can be used to identify the driver and determine whether or not he/she
is authorized" (App. Br. 14 (citing Murphy 14:46-65)). However, according
to Appellants, the Examiner has not shown the relevance of Murphy's token
to a nonoccurrence of a second event, wherein the second event is a presence
of a token, as recited in claim 4 (App. Br. 14; Reply Br. 6). Additionally,
Appellants assert the Examiner has not shown why it would have been
obvious to combine the teachings of Murphy with those of Langfahl (App.
Br. 14; Reply Br. 6).
We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments. The Examiner has
articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning - "[by] permitting the
determination of whether the person attempting to gain access to the vehicle
is authorized or permitted to access and drive the vehicle so as to prevent
unauthorized personnel from accessing the vehicle" (Ans. 16; Non-Final
Act. 17-18). Appellants have not persuaded us this reasoning is in error.
In the Reply Brief, Appellants, for the first time, present an argument
that the Examiner used improper hindsight (Reply Br. 6); however,
Appellants have not explained why, nor is it apparent that, these arguments

8

Appeal2015-003104
Application 12/632,943
were necessitated by a new point in the Examiner's Answer or any other
circumstance constituting "good cause" for its belated presentation.
Therefore, Appellants have not shown that we should consider the new
argument.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded the Examiner erred in finding the
combination of Langfahl, Basir, and Murphy teaches or suggests the
limitations as recited in claim 4. Therefore, we sustain the rejection of claim
4 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) for obviousness over Langfahl, Basir, and
Murphy.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejection of claims 2, 3, and 5-21 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as being unpatentable over Langfahl and Basir is affirmed.
The Examiner's rejection of claim 4 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
being unpatentable over Langfahl, Basir, and Murphy is affirmed.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.
§ 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
