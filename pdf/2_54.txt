and 5-19. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We affirm.

Appeal2014-009244
Application 12/944,791
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The majority of the claims are directed to a package, while claim 16
and its dependents are directed to a cigarette dispensing package. Claim 16
is reproduced below:
16. A cigarette dispensing package which comprises:
an outer case formed into a rectangular parallelepiped
shape and having a front wall, a rear wall, a bottom wall, a pair
of side walls, and an open end at a top thereof;
a tongue lid rotatably connected to a rear edge of the open
end through a lid hinge, said tongue lid including a lid portion
for opening/closing the open end and a tongue connected to a tip
end of the lid portion through a tongue hinge, in which the tongue
is superimposed upon an outer surface of the front wall of said
outer case when the lid portion is in a closed position; and
an inner holder for housing the package contents, said
inner holder being slidably disposed within said outer case
through the open end at the top of said outer case, said inner
holder having a bottom wall, side walls and a rear wall which
define a single recessed area offset from the corresponding walls
of the outer case; and having an open front face which faces the
front walls of the outer case and an open top end, said open top
end providing access to and selective removal of the contents of
the inner holder through the open end of the outer case when the
inner holder is disposed within the outer case,
wherein the outer case, the tongue lid and the inner holder
are made of a transparent or translucent material so that when the
inner holder is disposed within the outer case, the contents of the
dispensing package disposed in the recessed area of the inner
holder appear to be floating within the outer case.

REJECTIONS
Claims 1, 6-10, 12, and 14--19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. §103(a)
as being unpatentable over Kajiwara, Palazzo, and Fuller.
Claim 5 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being unpatentable
over Kajiwara, Palazzo, Fuller, and Cote.
Claims 11 and 13 are rejected under 3 5 U.S. C. § 103 (a) as being
unpatentable over Kajiwara, Palazzo, Fuller, and Draghetti.

OPINION
Claims 1, 7, and 16 are independent. Appellants highlight claim 16 as
representative of the independent claims. Appeal Br. 6. Appellants also
argue the majority of the claims together with claim 16. Id. Thus, claims 1,
6-10, 12, 14, 15, and 17-19 stand or fall withtherejectionofclaim 16. See
37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(iv). Appellants also separately argue the rejection of
claim 5 and the rejection of claims 11 and 13. Appeal Br. 9-11. We select
claims 5 and 11 for review.

Claims 1, 6--10, 12, and 14-19
In rejecting the independent claims, the Examiner finds that Kajiwara
teaches the majority of the claimed features. Final Act. 2--4, 7-9. The
Examiner further finds that Palazzo teaches many of the features of the
tongue-lid. Id. at 4. The Examiner finds that Fuller teaches "a package for
holding [or dispensing] cigarettes" including an inner holder and a recessed

3

Appeal2014-009244
Application 12/944,791
area with many of the features of the claims. Id. at 4--5, 8. The Examiner
then finds that these references teach all the recited limitations and provides
reasons concluding that the combination of these teachings would be
obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art. Id. at 4, 5, 9.
Appellants argue that "none of the prior art relied upon by the
Examiner suggests the Appellants' inventive contribution." Appeal Br. 6.
In support of this argument, Appellants provide of list of features present in
Kajiwara and Fuller that they argue are different from what is required by
the claims. Id. at 6-7.
For example, Appellants argue that in Kajiwara "restricting elements
would be visible through the transparency of the cover member 12 [which]
would clearly not permit the content of the tray to appear to be floating." Id.
at 7.
In response the Examiner finds that because "the recess 2a [of
Kajiwara] is offset from each of the outer walls of the inner holder" and "the
recess 2a is shown to be spaced from the bottom surface of the outer holder,"
the content in the container would "appear to be floating over a surface on
which the container is placed" independent from the restricting elements.
Answer 12.
Appellants argue that Kajiwara does not suggest a "hollow" inner
holder. Appeal Br. 7. The Examiner responds that "[F]igure 2 of Kajiwara
shows the hollow construction claimed since the recess 2a is spaced from all
of the outer walls of the inner holder." Answer 13.
In view of the record presented, we hold that the Examiner has offered
sufficient evidence that Kajiwara teaches or suggests a hollow construction
and that the contents would appear to be floating as required by claim 16.

Appeal2014-009244
Application 12/944,791
Appellants also argue that Kajiwara is "not [a] dispensing package"
and further "[t]he inner holder (tray 2) does NOT have an open top end and
therefore its contents cannot be dispensed while the tray is still disposed in
the outer case." Appeal Br. 6.
The Examiner responds "that it is possible to remove content from the
inner holder of Kajiwara by partially removing the inner holder from the
outer case." Answer 13. The Examiner also notes that "the rejection ...
relies upon the proposed combination of Kajiwara in view of Fuller and
Palazzo, and not the structure of Kajiwara alone." Id. For example, the
Examiner finds that Fuller teaches an inner tray with an open top, which
teachings are combined with Kajiwara in the rejection. Final Act. 5.
Appellants' arguments focusing on the individual references are
unconvincing for a number of reasons. First, as shown in the third example
above, the majority of items listed by Appellants as different were not relied
upon by the Examiner in the rejection. 1 Second, one cannot show
nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the rejections are
based on combinations of references. See In re Merck & Co., 800 F .2d 1091,
1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Appellants argue the prior art references individually
and do not argue against the combination of teachings from the prior art as
outlined in the rejection. As noted by the Examiner:
The Appellant has argued that Kajiwara and Fuller are
individually different than the applicant's invention (page 6 and
7 of Appeal Brief show how the individual references differ from
1

As a further example, Appellants argue that Kajiwara shows an inner
holder with "multiple recessed areas," instead of the claimed "single
recessed area." Appeal Br. 6. The Examiner finds that Fuller teaches this
feature, not Kajiwara. See also Answer 14 (Examiner states "the rejection
above does not rely on these features of Fuller").
5

Appeal2014-009244
Application 12/944,791
the claimed invention). However, the rejection above is not based
on these references individually, but rather the proposed
combination of Kajiwara in view of Palazzo and Fuller.
Answer 14.
Appellants also argue that:
although the prior art references are related to containers for
housing various contents, because the contents of, for example,
the Kajiwara and Fuller references, are so different from each
other and from the present invention, it is believed that the
Appellants have defined an inventive contribution which is not
even remotely contemplated by either of the references relied
upon by the Examiner, either alone or in combination.
Appeal Br. 9.
Such "contemplation" by a specific reference is not required to
support a finding of obviousness. Appellants' argument is foreclosed by
KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398 (2007), in which the Court

rejected the rigid requirement of a teaching or suggestion or motivation to
combine known elements in order to show obviousness. KSR, 550 U.S. at
415. The Court noted that an obviousness analysis "need not seek out
precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged
claim, for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a
person of ordinary skill in the art would employ." Id. at 418.
For the above reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 16. For these
same reasons, we sustain the rejections of claims 1, 6-10, 12, 14, 15, and
17-19.

Claim 5

Appellants argue that the rejection of claim 5 is improper because "it
is not understood why it would be obvious to one skilled in the art to look to
6

Appeal2014-009244
Application 12/944,791
three different, unrelated technological fields for solving problems
associated with a tongue-lid package which is utilized for accommodating
tobacco products." Appeal Br. 9.
Claim 5 depends from claim 1. Claims 1 and 5 are both directed to a
"tongue-lid package" and do not require or discuss "tobacco products." As
noted by the Examiner "[e]ach reference relates to the field of packages
designed to hold a content." Answer 16. The cited references are all in the
same field of endeavor as claim 5. Further, features that do not appear in a
claim cannot be relied on for patentability. In re Self, 671 F.2d 1344, 1348
(CCPA 1982). As Appellants' argument is not commensurate with the
scope of claim 5, we are not apprised of error in the rejection of claim 5.

Claims 11 and 13

Similar to claim 5, Appellants argue that the rejection of claim 11 is
improper because "it is not understood why it would be obvious to one
skilled in the art to look to three different, unrelated technological fields for
solving problems associated with a tongue-lid package which is utilized for
accommodating tobacco products." Appeal Br. 9.
Claim 11 depends from claim 1 and, like claims 1 and 5, claim 11 is
directed to a "tongue-lid package" and does not require or discuss "tobacco
products." Thus, Appellants argument is not commensurate with the scope
of claim 11. All of the cited references are in the same field of endeavor as
claim 11.
Appellants' also provide a discussion on the law of obviousness.
Appeal Br. 10-11. This discussion does not discuss the facts of the present
application, or point out any errors in the rejection. The Board "reviews the

7

Appeal2014-009244
Application 12/944,791
obviousness rejection for error based upon the issues identified by the
appellant, and in light of the arguments and evidence produced thereon." Ex
Parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1075 (BPAI Fe. 26, 2010)(precedential)(cited

with approval in In re Jung, 637 F.3d 1356, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). As no
errors have been identified by Appellants in this discussion of the law,
Appellants have not apprised us of error in the rejection of claims 11 and 13.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejection of claims 1 and 5-19 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.

§ 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
