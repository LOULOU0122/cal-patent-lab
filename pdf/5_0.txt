DISCUSSION
Upon consideration of the evidence on this appeal record in light of
the arguments advanced by the Examiner and Appellants, we concur with
Appellants that the Examiner does not carry the burden of establishing a
prima facie case of obviousness regarding the subject matter recited in
claims 28, 30-33, and 37--46 within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
Accordingly, we reverse the Examiner's§ 103(a) rejections of these claims

3

Appeal2015-004134
Application 12/085,399
substantially for the reasons set forth in the Appeal Brief. We add the
discussion below primarily for emphasis and completeness. 3
The Examiner has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of
obviousness regarding the subject matter recited in the claims on appeal. In
re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("[T]he [patent] examiner
bears the initial burden, on review of the prior art or on any other ground, of
presenting a primafacie case ofunpatentability."); see also In re Jung, 637
F.3d 1356, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (explaining that while "the applicant
must identify to the Board what the examiner did wrong, ... the examiner
retains the burden to show [unpatentability ]").
The Examiner finds that Maloney discloses a coating for a metallic
substrate that comprises an outer thermal barrier coating, corresponding to
the outer ceramic layer recited in claim 28, and an inner ceramic bond coat,
corresponding to the inner ceramic layer recited in claim 28. (Final Act. 2.)
The Examiner finds that Maloney discloses that when the thermal barrier
coating is applied to a blade of a gas turbine engine, reducing or increasing
the thickness of the coating affects the life of the blade and the substrate
creep life. (Final Act. 3.) The Examiner determines that it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to adjust the thickness of the
thermal barrier coating based on operating conditions and desired properties

3

For the purposes of this appeal, we select claim 28, the broadest claim on
appeal, as representative, and decide the propriety of the rejections under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) based on this claim alone.
4

Appeal2015-004134
Application 12/085,399
to optimize the performance of the coating. (Id.)
The Examiner finds that Maloney discloses adjusting the thickness of
the ceramic bond coat applied to a turbine blade to allow for rotation of the
blade while achieving desired thermal characteristics, and the Examiner
determines that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
to adjust the thickness of this layer appropriately. (Final Act. 3-4.) The
Examiner further finds that Maloney exemplifies a thermal barrier coating
having a thickness of 49 µm, and a ceramic bond coat with a thickness of 0.5
mils (12.7 µm). (Final Act. 4.) The Examiner determines that the
exemplified ceramic bond coat constitutes about 25% of the total thickness
of both exemplified coatings based on his or her calculation, and concludes
that the total thickness of the coatings can be adjusted appropriately. (Final
Act. 4, 12.)
However, the Examiner does not demonstrate that one of ordinary
skill in the art reasonably would have been led to produce inner and outer
ceramic layers having the total thickness of about 300 µm to about 800 µm,
with the thickness of the inner layer being 10% to 50% of such total
thickness, as recited in claim 28. Maloney discloses ceramic coatings that
have particular utility in gas turbine engines, and explains that weight is
always a critical factor when designing gas turbine engines, particularly for
rotating parts. (Maloney col. 1, 11. 13-14; col 2, 11. 11-12.) Maloney further
explains that ceramic thermal barrier coatings are not load supporting
materials, and consequently they add weight without increasing strength.

5

Appeal2015-004134
Application 12/085,399
(Ivfaloney col. 2, 11. 13-15.) Ivfaloney teaches that ceramic thermal barrier
material should therefore add the minimum weight while providing the
maximum thermal insulation capability. (Maloney col. 2, 11. 15-17.)
Maloney also discloses that reducing the thickness of a thermal barrier
coating (outer ceramic layer) on a typical turbine blade by 50% lowers the
blade pull by about 1,500 pounds at typical operating conditions, resulting in
a significant increase in the life of the blade and permitting the mass of the
disk to which the blade is attached to be reduced. (Maloney col. 8, 11. 1422.) Maloney further discloses that when a ceramic bond coat (inner
ceramic layer) is applied to a turbine blade, it should be no thicker than
necessary to cover the underlying material because it adds weight to the
blade, contributing significantly to blade pull. (Maloney col. 10, 11. 59-64.)
In this context, Maloney exemplifies a thermal barrier coating, (Gd,Y,Zr)02
coating, having a thickness of 49 µm-in which a ceramic bond coat
composed of 7YSZ is applied to a substrate between a metal bond coat and a
thermal barrier coating in one embodiment and exemplifies a ceramic bond
coat with a thickness of 0.5 mils (12.7 µm) in another embodiment.
(Maloney col. 9, 11. 6-17 and col. 10, 11. 55-66.) Nowhere does Maloney
recognize the importance of increasing the total thickness of the thermal
barrier coating and the ceramic bond coat from its exemplified total
thickness to a much greater total thickness of about 300 µm to about 800 µm
(about 5 to about 13 times higher than the combined thickness of the thermal
barrier coating and the ceramic bond coat exemplified in Maloney referred

6

Appeal2015-004134
Application 12/085,399
to by the Examiner). (Ivfaloney cols. 6-11.) Nor does Ivfaloney recognize
the importance of retaining the recited relative thicknesses of the thermal
barrier coating and the ceramic bond coat having such total thickness. Id.
As stated by the predecessor to our reviewing court in In re Sebek, 465 F .2d
904, 907 (CCPA 1972):
Where, as here, the prior art disclosure suggests the outer
limit of the range of suitable values, and that the optimum
resides within that range, and where there are indications
elsewhere that in fact the optimum should be sought within that
range, the determination of optimum values outside that range
may not be obvious.
On this record, we find that the Examiner does not identify any teaching in
Maloney that indicates or would have suggested the total and relative
thicknesses of the thermal barrier coating and the ceramic bond coat recited
in claim 2 8.
In reaching this determination, we also consider the Examiner's
assertion that the thickness of the thermal barrier coating and the ceramic
bond coat disclosed in Maloney "are dependent upon the dimensions of the
turbine blade," and one of ordinary skill in the art could have determined an
appropriate thickness for each layer that would prevent blade pull while
maintaining desired thermal characteristics. (Ans. 12.) However, the
Examiner provides no evidence to support the assertion that the thickness of
both coatings would depend on the dimensions of a turbine blade on which
the layers are coated, nor does the Examiner take official notice that this was

7

Appeal2015-004134
Application 12/085,399
known in the art at the time of the invention. (Id.) Even assuming that it
was known that the dimensions of a turbine blade would affect the
thicknesses of the thermal barrier coating and the ceramic bond coat, the
Examiner does not establish that one of ordinary skill in the art would have
been led from Maloney' s disclosures to produce a coating for a turbine blade
in which the total and relative thicknesses of both layers correspond to the
corresponding values recited in claim 28 inasmuch as Maloney teaches or
suggests decreasing the thickness of the thermal barrier coating and the
ceramic bond coat to prevent a significant decrease in the life of the blade as
indicated supra. The Examiner does not rely on the remaining prior art
references to remedy the above deficiencies. (Ans. 2-12.)
Accordingly, on this record, we are constrained to reverse the
Examiner's rejections of claims 28, 30-33, and 37- 46 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a).
ORDER
In view of the reasons set forth in the Appeal Brief and above, the
Examiner's§ 103(a) rejections of claims 28, 30-33, and 37- 46 are reversed.
REVERSED
