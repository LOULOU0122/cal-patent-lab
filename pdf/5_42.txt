Application 12/389,696
THE INVENTION
Appellants' invention relates to implantable medical constructs.
Spec. i-f 2. Claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative of the subject matter on
appeal.
1. An implantable biostaple comprising collagen fibers
having sufficient rigidity ex vivo and in vivo to define a
biostaple body with a self-supported pre-formed shape with a
crown and two opposing outwardly extending legs, wherein, in
operative position, the legs extend outwardly from the crown
over their entire length.

OPINION

Anticipation of
Claims 1-10, 12-14, 22-25, 27-28, and 34 by Koob
Claim 1
The Examiner finds that Koob discloses all of the elements of claim 1.
Final Action 2. In particular, the Examiner finds that Koob discloses an
implantable biostaple, comprising collagen fibers, that is capable of having
sufficient rigidity ex vivo and in vivo to define a biostaple body with a selfsupported pre-formed shape with a crown and two opposing outwardly
extending legs. Id.
Appellants traverse the Examiner's rejection by arguing that Koob's
constructs are flexible, not rigid. Appeal Br. 4. Appellants also argue that
Koob lacks a pre-formed shape with a crown and two opposing outwardly
extending legs. Id. at 5. Appellants argue that Koob describes a flexible
construct that may rolled, wrapped or folded for insertion in a substantially
round bone tunnel. Id.
In response, the Examiner states the Koob' s structure 20 is a solid
structure and, therefore, capable of maintaining its shape. Ans. 9. The

2

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696
Examiner finds that Koob discloses that its structure has strength and
stiffness similar to natural tendons and ligaments and, therefore, is
sufficiently rigid to meet the claim limitations. Id. (citing Koob i-f 103). The
Examiner directs our attention to an annotated version of Koob, Figure 4, to
demonstrate that Koob's construct exhibits a crown and two outwardly
extended legs. Id. (referring to Ans. 7 drawing).
Appellants' arguments do not persuade us that the Examiner erred in
finding that Koob is capable of having sufficient rigidity to define a selfsupported, pre-formed shape as claimed. Appellants argue claim 1 as if the
"self-supported pre-formed shape" limitation is a structural limitation.
However, the claim merely recites a biostaple comprised of collagen fibers
that has sufficient rigidity "to define" a biostaple body with a self-supported
pre-formed shape. Claims App. In other words, as long as Koob's biostaple
comprised of collagen fibers has sufficient rigidity that it is capable of
assuming a self-supported, pre-formed shape with a crown and two
outwardly extending legs, the claim is satisfied. See In re Swinehart, 439
F.2d 210, 212 (CCPA 1971).

Swinehart maintains that a patent applicant is free to recite features of
an apparatus either structurally or functionally. Id. ("[T]here is nothing
intrinsically wrong with [defining something by what it does rather than
what it is] in drafting patent claims."). Yet, choosing to define an element
functionally, i.e., by what it does, carries with it a risk:
where the Patent Office has reason to believe that a functional
limitation asserted to be critical for establishing novelty in the
claimed subject matter may, in fact, be an inherent
characteristic of the prior art, it possesses the authority to
require the applicant to prove that the subject matter shown to
be in the prior art does not possess the characteristic relied on.

lU. al L l.J.

In the instant case, Koob discloses exemplary properties of collagen
fibers of different sizes. Koob i-f 106. Performance parameters including
stiffness are reported. Id.; see also Figs. 14A-C. 1 Koob teaches that lesser
and greater numbers of fibers may be used depending on the desired tensile
strength, rigidity, or other mechanical parameters of the construct at the
target implant site. Id. i-f 77. The Examiner finds that Koob is capable of
satisfying the functional limitation directed to a rigid, pre-formed shape.
The Examiner supports this position with evidence that Koob has strength
and stiffness similar to natural tendons and ligaments and reasons that this is
sufficiently rigid to satisfy the claim. Ans. 9. The Examiner's reasoning is
sufficient to shift the burden of persuasion to Appellants. See In re Spada,
911 F.2d 705, 708 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("when the PTO shows sound basis for
believing that the products of the applicant and the prior art are the same, the
applicant has the burden of showing that they are not.").
Appellants attempt to traverse the Examiner's findings of fact and
accompanying technical reasoning with mere legal argument:
Clearly, natural tendons and ligaments do not have a rigid
structure such that they have a pre-formed shape with a crown
and two opposing outwardly extending legs as claimed.
Instead, natural tendons and ligaments have a flexible strength
and stiffness that allows them to bend and stretch.

Application 12/389,696
Reply Br. 3. However, it is well settled that attorney argument cannot take
the place of evidence in the record. Estee Lauder, Inc. v. L 'Orea!, S.A., 129
F.3d 588, 595 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
Furthermore, as used in the Specification, "rigid" does not mean
incapable of being bent. Rather, the Specification merely teaches that the
biostaple construct of collagen fibers has sufficient rigidity to retain its
shape. Spec. i-fi-1 8, 9, 30, 68.
The biostaple 10 can be configured to be sufficiently rigid to
retain its shape yet also flexible to approximate the stiffness and
flexibility of a ligament.
Spec. i168. In the instant case, Appellants present no evidence that tends to
show that Koob' s construct is not capable of meeting the functional rigidity
limitation of claim 1. In particular, while Appellants' Specification
acknowledges that natural ligaments possess both flexibility and "stiffness"
(Spec. i1 68), Appellants present no evidence that such stiffness is not
sufficient to allow the biostaple construct to maintain a pre-formed shape ex
vivo. The burden of persuasion on this issue having shifted to Appellants,

we find that Appellants have failed to carry their burden.
Appellants next argue that Koob provides no enabling description "as
to how to form long thin flexible collagen fibers into a rigid, self-supported
biostaple before implantation." Appeal Br. 8. Appellants argue that forming
such a bio-staple "is difficult." Id. Appellants contend that Koob lacks a
disclosure that would enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to form
fibers into the claimed shape. Id.
Appellants' non-enablement argument is not persuasive. The
Examiner is entitled to a presumption that Koob enables claim 1:

5

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696
[A]n examiner, who has no access to experts or laboratories, is
not in a position to test each piece of prior art for enablement in
citing it, and requiring him to do so would be onerous, if not
impossible. An examiner, therefore, is not required to
anticipate every possible response to a rejection, including
showing that a cited reference is enabling.
Consistent with the statutory frame-work and our precedent, we
therefore hold that, during patent prosecution, an examiner is
entitled to reject claims as anticipated by a prior art publication
or patent without conducting an inquiry into whether or not that
prior art reference is enabling. As long as an examiner makes a
proper prima facie case of anticipation by giving adequate
notice under§ 132, the burden shifts to the applicant to submit
rebuttal evidence of nonenablement.

In re Antor Media Corp., 689 F.3d 1282, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Here,
Appellants offer no persuasive evidence to rebut the presumption that Koob
is an enabling reference.
In view of the foregoing, we determine that the Examiner's findings
of fact are supported by preponderance of the evidence and we sustain the
rejection of claim 1.

Claim 12
Claim 12 is an independent claim that is directed to a medical kit that
includes a biostaple that is substantially similar to the biostaple of claim 1.
Claims App. In traversing the rejection, Appellants essentially repeat the
same arguments that we considered and found unpersuasive with respect to
claim 1 and find equally unpersuasive here. We sustain the rejection of
claim 12.

Claims 5 and 24
Claims 5 and 24 depend from claim 1 and add limitations directed to
the dimensions of a bone tunnel which the biostaple is configured to reside

6

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696
within. Claims App. The Examiner finds that Koob's construct is capable
of residing in bone tunnels as claimed. Final Action 3, 4 (citing Koob,

iTiT 74, 78, 82).
In traversing the rejection, Appellants essentially repeat the same
arguments that we considered and found unpersuasive with respect to
claim 1 and find equally unpersuasive here. We sustain the rejection of
claims 5 and 24.
Claims 7, 22, and 34

Claims 7 and 22 depend from claim 1. Claims App. Claim 34
depends from claim 1. Id. These claims contain limitations directed to the
number and/or length of collagen fibers in the biostaple. Id. Appellants
argue these claims together. Appeal Br. 11. We select claim 22 as
representative. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv) (2015).
The Examiner finds that Koob discloses a construct that has between
about 2--400 elongate collagen fibers with a leg length of about 5-10 mm.
Final Action 4 (citing Koob iTiT 77, 82).
In traversing the rejection, Appellants essentially repeat the same
arguments that we considered and found unpersuasive with respect to
claim 1 and find equally unpersuasive here. We sustain the rejection of
claims 7, 22, and 34.
Claims 25 and 27

Claim 25 depends from claim 1 and claim 27 depends from claim 12.
Claims App. Each claim contains a limitation directed to a gelatin binder
that holds the fibers together and fills voids to form a substantially constant
leg diameter. Id. Appellants argue these claims together. Appeal Br. 1112. We select claim 25 as representative.

7

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696
The Examiner finds that Koob discloses a construct comprising a
gelatin binder as claimed in claim 25. Final Action 4 (citing Koob i-f 68).
Appellants acknowledge that Koob discloses that its fibers can be held
together using a gelatinous coating. Appeal Br. 11. However, Appellants
argue that Koob fails to disclose using a gelatin binder to fill voids and
create a construct with a substantially constant leg diameter. Id.
In response, the Examiner points out that Koob states, "The array of
fibers can be held together in any suitable manner including by their natural
affinity to stick together upon compression or extrusion, by using a sticky
coating or adhesive, such as a gelatinous coating," Ans. 9 (quoting Koob

i-f 68). The Examiner directs our attention to Figure 4B of Koob as
exhibiting a substantially constant leg diameter. Id.
In their reply, Appellants essentially reiterate the arguments from their
Appeal Brief. Reply Br. 4.
We have reviewed Figure 4B of Koob. "Description for the purposes
of anticipation can be by drawings alone as well as by words." In re Mraz,
455 F.2d 1069, 1072 (CCPA 1972). In view of what is shown in Figure 4B
of Koob, the Examiner's findings with respect to a substantially constant leg
diameter are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. We sustain the
rejection of claims 25 and 27.
Claim 28

Claim 28 depends from claim 1 and adds the limitation: "wherein the
crown is substantially horizontal with rounded opposing outer edge
portions." Claims App. In traversing the rejection, Appellants essentially
repeat the same arguments that we considered and found unpersuasive with

8

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696
respect to claim 1 and find equally unpersuasive here. \Ve sustain the
rejection of claim 28.
Claims 2--4, 6, 8-10, 13, 14, and 23

Appellants do not argue for the separate patentability of claims 2--4, 6,
8-10, 13, 14, and 23 apart from arguments presented with respect to
claims 1 and 12 which we have previously considered and found
unpersuasive. We sustain the rejection of claims 2--4, 6, 8-10, 13, 14,
and 23. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv)(2015) (waiver where claims not
argued separately).
Unpatentability of Claims 11, 29, and 31
over Koob and Conners
Claim 11

Claim 11 is an independent claim that is substantially similar in scope
to claim 25 except that the legs of the biostaple have a beveled edge. Claims
App. The Examiner relies on Conners as disclosing a staple with a crown,
two legs, and beveled end points. Final Action 6. The Examiner concludes
that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the
time of the invention to modify the device of Koob with leg portions having
beveled edges. Id. at 7. According to the Examiner, a person of ordinary
skill in the art would have done this to cleanly pierce or penetrate tissue. Id.
Appellants traverse the rejection by arguing many of the points that
we considered and found unpersuasive with respect to claims 1 and 25 and
that we find equally unpersuasive here. Appeal Br. 12-13. Appellants also
argue that there is no reason to modify Koob with the teachings of Conners.
Id. at 13. Appellants argue that Conners uses sharply chiseled end points to

pierce body organs and tissue. Id. Appellants contrast the purpose of

9

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696
Conners with that of the instant invention that is formed to extend into bone
tunnels. Id. In response, the Examiner states that Connors teaches beveled
end points that are configured to improve insertion into tissue. Ans. 10.
We are not persuaded that the Examiner erred in modifying Koob
with Conners. Appellants' Specification teaches that:
The legs 16, 17 can be aligned with the respective bone
tunnel 110 and pushed in. The beveled end of the legs can help
facilitate equal forces are exerted during insertion.
Spec. i-f 54. We discern little difference between beveling an edge to pierce
tissue and beveling an edge to facilitate insertion into a bone tunnel. "A
reference may be read for all that it teaches, including uses beyond its
primary purpose." In re Mouttet, 686 F.3d 1322, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2012),
citingKSRint'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550U.S. 398, 418-21 (2007). Itis
common sense that familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their
primary purposes, and a person of ordinary skill often will be able to fit the
teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle. KSR, 550 U.S.
at 420. A person of ordinary skill in the art would have readily seen that
Connor's beveled edges facilitate insertion of Koob's construct into bone
tunnels.
We sustain the rejection of claim 11.
Claims 29 and 31
Appellants do not argue for the separate patentability of claims 29 and
31 apart from arguments presented with respect to claim 11 which we have
previously considered and found unpersuasive. We sustain the rejection of
claim 29 and 31.

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696

Unpatentability of Claims 32 and 33
over Koob and Shapiro
Claims 32 and 33 depend from claims 1 and 12 respectively and each
add a limitation directed to the crown length that is less than the length of
the legs. Claims App. The Examiner relies on Shapiro as disclosing
biostaples for joining bone to bone and ligament to bone that have a crown
length that is less than the leg length as claimed. Final Action 8. The
Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary
skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify Koop with a
biostaple having component lengths as taught by Shapiro. Id. According to
the Examiner, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have done this
because such a configuration is useful in joint preplacement surgery and
ligamentous reconstruction. Id. (citing Shapiro, col. 4, 11. 11-13).
Appellants argue that Shapiro describes a construct that is "distinctly
different" than the collagen constructs of Koob. Appeal Br. 15. Appellants
argue that Shapiro's staples are driven into a portion of a bone using a power
tool. Id. Appellants contend, therefore, that a person of ordinary skill in the
art would have had no reason to combine Koob and Shapiro. Id.
Appellants' arguments are not persuasive. The Examiner merely
relies on Shapiro as teaching respective lengths for the crown and leg
portions. Final Action 8; Ans. 10. Shapiro discloses a method of joining
bone to bone, tendon to bone, and ligament to bone using a power staple gun
or a power rivet gun. Shapiro, Abstract. Shapiro discloses staples that have
legs that are longer than the crown. Shapiro, Fig. 8. The instant application
and Shapiro both disclose joining joints in the hand. Shapiro, Fig. 1;
Appellants' Fig. 5. The mere fact that Shapiro's staples are used in
connection with a different method of insertion does not negate its
11

Appeal2014-009277
Application 12/389,696
usefulness to a person of ordinary skill in the art in teaching the respective
component lengths. Mouttet, supra.
We sustain the rejection of claims 32 and 33.
DECISION
The decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1-14, 22-25, 27-29,
and 31-34 affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
