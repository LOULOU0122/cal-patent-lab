SCOTT E. BAIN, Administrative Patent Judges.
RAAP ALA, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is a decision on appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from a final
rejection of claims 1-28. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We affirm-in-part.

Appeal2013-010366
Application 12/239,657

TI'-JVENTION
Appellants' invention is directed to accelerating data communication
associated with browsing web pages or otherwise accessing content through
the Internet or other global or local network. Spec. i-f 2. Claims 1 and 16 are
exemplary of the subject matter on appeal:
1.
A method that improves data transportation
between a plurality of endpoints and a plurality of content
servers, wherein the transportation between the endpoints and
the content servers is based on the Internet Protocol ("IP"), the
method comprising the actions of:
intercepting a data transportation between the plurality of
endpoints and the plurality of content severs at an intermediate
device, wherein the data transportation is a markup language
("ML") file originating from a content server and directed
toward a destination endpoint that requested the ML file;
modifying the intercepted ML file to add:
a browser link associated with a compound object;
and
an instruction to activate a software code that is
embedded within the compound object;
sending the modified ML file toward the destination
endpoint;
the intermediate device receiving a request from the
destination endpoint for the compound object, wherein the
request was generated by the destination endpoint because of
the added browser link associated with the compound object;
the intermediate device responding to the request for the
compound object by:
identifying and retrieving one or more browser objects
from a cache;
embedding the retrieved one or more browser objects
into the compound object;

2

Appeal2013-010366
Application 12/239,657
embedding the software code into the compound object;
and
sending the compound object to the destination endpoint;
wherein the software code, when activated at the
destination endpoint per the added instruction, is operable to
adapt the modified ML file to enable retrieval of the one or
more browser objects that were embedded into the compound
object.
16. A method that determines the existence of an
object within the cache of a user endpoint, wherein
communication between one or more user endpoints and one or
more servers is based on Internet Protocol ("IP"), the method
comprising the actions of:
a.
receiving a request for a browser object from a
user endpoint;
b.
preparing a response to the request for the browser
object that includes the requested browser object and a cookie,
wherein the content of the cookie is associated with the browser
object;
c.
retrieving the cookie from a subsequent request
received from the user endpoint;
d.

parsing the cookie; and

e.
storing representative information about the
browser object associated with the cookie, wherein the browser
object associated with the cookie is expected to be stored in the
cache of the user endpoint;
wherein a browser object is an object that is fetched
automatically by the browser.

REJECTIONS ON APPEAL
Claims 1-15 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being obvious
over the combination of Jawahar (US 2008/0172488 Al; pub. July 17,

2008), Schroeder (US 2005/0021862 Al; pub. Jan. 27, 2005), and Fikes (US
7,779,103 Bl; iss. Aug. 17, 2010).
Claims 16-23 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
obvious over the combination of Fikes and Glommen (US 2002/014 7772
Al; pub. Oct. 10, 2002).
Claims 24--28 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as being
obvious over the combination of Schroeder, Fikes, and Glommen.

ISSUES
Appellants' contentions present us with the following dispositive
issues:
A) Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of Jawahar,
Schroeder, and Fikes teaches or suggests modifYing the intercepted ML file
to add ... an instruction to activate a software code that is embedded within
the compound object ("modifying" limitation), as recited in independent
claim 1?
B) Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of Fikes and
Glommen teaches or suggests the following limitations of claim 16: (i)
receiving a request for a browser object from a user endpoint ("receiving"
limitation); (ii) preparing a response to the request for the browser object
that includes the requested browser object and a cookie, wherein the content
of the cookie is associated with the browser object ("preparing" limitation);
(iii) storing representative information about the browser object associated
with the cookie, wherein the browser object associated with the cookie is
expected to be stored in the cache of the user endpoint ("storing" limitation);

Appeal2013-010366
Application 12/239,657
and (iv) wherein a browser object is an object that is fetched automatically
by the browser ("browser object" limitation).
ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejections in consideration of
Appellants' contentions and the evidence of record. We disagree with
Appellants' conclusions that the Examiner errs in rejecting claims 16-23.
Appellants have persuaded us the Examiner has failed to establish that
claims 1-15 and 24--28 are unpatentable over the cited prior art.
Issue A: Claims 1-15 and 24-28
The Examiner relies on Schroeder to teach the "modifying" limitation.
Final Act. 3--4. In particular, the Examiner finds Schroeder teaches adding a
modified link from the link mapping database, which will get activated by
retrieving video, graphics, or audio and displaying it to the user. Final Act.
4. The Examiner further finds as soon as the browser receives the web page,
it automatically retrieves browser objects embedded in the compound object
(URL), which teaches the claimed limitation. Ans. 28-29.
Appellants argue Schroeder describes modifying an existing browser
link with a link modifier, which does not teach or suggest the disputed
limitation. App. Br. 11-12. We agree. The cited sections of Schroeder
show an existing link in a web page being modified by first manually editing
the link to include a keyword (e.g., adding CONTENT_GPX to the URL)
and processing the link by a link modifier to match and replace keywords in
the link based on a mapping database (e.g., replacing "CONTENT_GPX"
with "www.deliv_net_A.com"). See Schroeder Figs 5A-5C, Fig. 6, i-fi-15861. Although the Examiner is correct that the browser retrieves the
associated content (e.g., video, graphics, audio), we agree with Appellants

5

Appeal2013-010366
Application 12/239,657
this is not sufficient to teach adding an instruction to activate a software

code.
For the reasons stated above, we are persuaded the Examiner has not
established the combination of Jawahar, Schroeder, and Fikes teaches or
suggests the "modifying" limitation recited in independent claim 1. The
Examiner does not rely on the additional reference of record (Glommen) to
teach or suggest this limitation. Accordingly, we do not sustain the 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) rejections of: (1) independent claim 1; (2) independent
claim 24, which recites a limitation substantially similar to the "modifying"
limitation and is rejected on the same basis; and (3) dependent claims 2-15
and 25-27.
Independent claim 28 recites embedding in the parsed response ... an

executable function. Appellants argue this claim is allowable for the same
reasons as independent claim 1. See App. Br. 21-23. The Examiner relies
on the same paragraphs of Schroeder used to reject the "modifying"
limitation recited in claim 1. Final Act. 19. As discussed supra, these
paragraphs teach modifying links in an HTML file. We agree with
Appellants that the modification of links does not teach embedding an

executable function. Accordingly, we do not sustain the 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)
rejection of claim 28.

Issue B: Claims 16--23
Appellants contend the combination of Fikes and Glommen does not
teach or suggest the "receiving," "preparing," "storing," and "browser
object" limitations recited in claim 16. App. Br. 16-20; Reply Br. 20-25.
Specifically, Appellants argue the paragraph cited from Fikes for the
"receiving" limitation deals with a relationship between a browser

6

Appeal2013-010366
Application 12/239,657
application and a user, and that the browser cannot receive a request from
the user end point because the browser is part of the user equipment. App.
Br. 18. Appellants argue the "preparing" limitation is not taught by Fikes
because claim 16 requires the prepared response include two different types
of data-a browser object and a cookie-and the Examiner incorrectly
asserts the cookie taught by Fikes is equivalent to the claimed browser
object. App. Br. 17-18. With respect to the "storing" limitation, Appellants
argue the claimed method uses the cookie to carry information associated
with a browser object that is sent to a user, which is different than using a
cookie to carry a user ID as taught in Fikes or storing a path that visitors take
through a website as taught by Glommen. App. Br. 16. Additionally,
Appellants argue the "browser object" limitation is not taught by the cited
references because it is clear the cited paragraphs of Glommen do not teach
or suggest an object that is fetched automatically by the browser, but instead
describe information that is written in the cookie and the cookie format.
App. Br. 19. We are not persuaded of error by Appellants' arguments.
The Examiner finds, and we agree, that Fikes teaches the "receiving"
limitation. Ans. 31. Contrary to Appellants' argument, the Examiner does
not find the browser receives the request from the user end point, but rather
finds Fikes teaches the user's browser is the end point from which the
request is received. Id. We agree with the Examiner's findings that the
cited sections of Fikes teach receiving a request from a user's web browser
application ("user endpoint") for a web page ("browser object"). See Fikes
9:19-27.
We further agree with the Examiner that Fikes teaches the "preparing"
limitation. Ans. 31. The cited sections of Fikes teach preparing a response

7

Appeal2013-010366
Application 12/239,657
to the request that includes the web page ("requested browser object") and
both a regular cookie and a secret cookie ("a cookie") that are included
(associated with) in the requested web page. See Fikes 9:20-38).
Appellants' argument that the Examiner equates the browser object to the
cookie is not persuasive, because as previously discussed, the Examiner
equates the web page to the browser object.
With respect to the "storing" limitation, Appellants' arguments do not
persuade us of error. As acknowledged by Appellants, the cited sections of
Glommen teach storing a path (in a cookie) that visitors take through a
website. App Br. 17; see Glommen i-fi-154--55. Appellants fail to convince
us that the path analysis data stored in the cookie does not teach or suggest
storing representative information about the visited web page ("browser
object").

1

Furthermore, Appellants do not present any arguments

specifically addressing the Examiner's findings (Ans. 32) that Fikes teaches
or suggests the web page (browser object) is expected to be stored in the
cache of the user endpoint. 2 See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv)(2012)(" A

In the event of further prosecution, we leave it to the Examiner to consider
whether the claimed "associated with" language in the "storing" limitation
of claim 16 satisfies 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph. See Ex parte
Miyazaki, 89 USPQ2d 1207, 1211 (BP AI 2008) (precedential) (A claim is
indefinite if it amenable to two or more plausible claim constructions). In
particular, it appears the "associated with" language may be interpreted to:
(i) require the "representative information" be associated with the cookie (as
argued by Appellants and consistent with the findings made by the
Examiner); or (ii) merely require the "browser object" to be associated with
the cookie (i.e., not require the stored representative information to be
associated with the cookie).
2
Although not relied upon for our decision, we further observe the claimed
"wherein the browser object associated with the cookie is expected to be
stored in the cache of the user endpoint" (emphasis added) does not require
8

Appeal2013-010366
Application 12/239,657
statement which merely points out what a claim recites will not be
considered an argument for separate patentability of the claim.").
Finally, we are unpersuaded by Appellants' argument that the cited
paragraphs of Glommen do not teach the "browser object" limitation. We
observe that Appellants incorrectly refer to this limitation as reciting "the
browser object" (i.e., claiming antecedent basis back to the browser object
recited in previous limitations). See App. Br. 19. However, this limitation
in fact recites "a browser object" (i.e., does not claim antecedent basis back
to the prior browser object limitation). The Examiner finds Glommen
teaches the disputed limitation. Ans. 32 (citing Glommen i-fi-154--55).
Appellants do not persuade us that the "cookie" taught by Glommen is not a
browser object fetched automatically by the browser.
For the reasons stated above, Appellants fail to persuade us the
Examiner errs in finding the combination of Fikes and Glommen teaches or
suggests the disputed limitations recited in claim 16. Accordingly, we
sustain the 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) rejection of claim 16 and its dependent claims
17-22, which are not argued separately.

the browser object to be stored in the cache and does not provide any
limitation on the steps performed in the claimed method. The claim
language thus appears to be optional language that recites an intended use of
the cookie and not a positive limitation on the claim. See Boehringer
Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. v. Schering-Plough Corp., 320 F.3d 1339, 1345
(Fed. Cir. 2003) ("An intended use or purpose usually will not limit the
scope of the claim because such statements usually do no more than define a
context in which the invention operates.").

DECISION
We affirm the Examiner's decision to reject claims 16-23 and reverse
the Examiner's decision to reject claims 1-15 and 24--28.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.
