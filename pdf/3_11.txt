Before N. WHITNEY WILSON, CHRISTOPHER L. OGDEN, and
MONTE T. SQUIRE, Administrative Patent Judges.
OGDEN, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's final
decision rejecting claims 1-8 in the above-identified application. 2 We have
jurisdiction pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 6(b ).
We AFFIRM.
1

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is SYNCERA INC.
Appeal Br. 3.
2
Appellants also appealed the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 9, 10,
and 14--19. See Appeal Br. 1. However, the sole rejection affecting these
claims has been withdrawn, so that these claims are no longer on appeal.
See Answer 7 (withdrawing rejection, see Final Action 3--4, of claims 1-10
and 14--19 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph as non-enabling).

Appeal2015-002993
Application 13/406,489
BACKGROUND
Appellants' invention relates to polymeric compositions, of a
particular structure, for use in medicine, surgery, dentistry, and other fields.

See Spec. 8. Independent claim 1 is representative:
1. A composition made by a process comprising blending (i) at
least one random copolymer consisting of ethylene oxide and
one or more other alkylene oxide(s) and (ii) at least one nonrandom polymer consisting of one or more poly( alkylene
oxide )s; wherein said composition adheres to bone, skin, or
other hard tissue.

Appeal Br. 14 (emphasis added).
The Examiner maintains the following grounds of rejection:
I.

Claims 1--4, 6, and 7 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as

anticipated or, in the alternative under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a), as obvious over
Canadian Patent Application No. 2,063,278 Al (published Dec. 6, 1992).
Answer 2.
II.

Claims 1-5 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as anticipated

or, in the alternative under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a), as obvious over German
Patent Application No. DE 2546371 Al (published Apr. 21, 1977). Answer
3.
III.

Claims 1---6 and 8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as

anticipated or, in the alternative under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a), as obvious over
Japanese Patent Application No. 55-147597 (published Nov. 17, 1980).
Answer4.
IV.

Claims 1, 4---6, and 8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as

anticipated or, in the alternative under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a), as obvious over
German Patent Application No. DE 3224784 Al (published Jan. 5, 1984).
Answer 5.

Appeal2015-002993
Application 13/406,489
V.

Claims 1, 4, 6, and 8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as

anticipated or, in the alternative under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a), as obvious over
U.S. Patent No. 3,634,305 (issued Jan. 11, 1972). Answer 6.
In the Appeal Brief, Appellants divide the claims separately into five
groups, based on which rejections the claims have in common. See Appeal
Br. 9. Nevertheless, Appellants address each rejection separately, and argue
the claims as a group with respect to each rejection. See Appeal Br. 9-13.
Therefore, consistent with the provisions of 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv)
(2013), we limit our discussion to claim 1, and for each rejection, all other
claims stand or fall together with claim 1.
The Final Action also contains an objection to claims 9, 10, and 14--19
as being dependent upon a rejected independent claim 1. See Final Action 3;

see also Appeal Br. 5, 8-9 (arguing that this objection has been overcome,
and that withdrawn claim 22 should be rejoined). However, this objection is
not before us for decision on appeal. See In re Hengehold, 440 F.2d 1395,
1404 (CCPA 1971).
DISCUSSION
For each of rejections I-V, the Examiner cites a single reference, and
finds that the reference discloses a chemical structure obtained by the
blending process specified in claim 1. See Answer 2---6. Appellants do not
contest these findings. See Appeal Br. 9-13. The Examiner also
determines, with respect to each rejection, that "[t]he claimed composition
exhibiting the feature of adhering to bone, skin or other hard tissue is an
inherent property of the composition and is not an affirmative limitation."
Answer 2---6. Thus, the Examiner determines that "the prior art blend
inherently adheres to bone, skin or other hard tissue. The burden of proof

3

Appeal2015-002993
Application 13/406,489
shifts to appellants to provide evidence that the prior art blend would not be
capable of adhering to bone, skin or other hard tissue." Id.
Separately for each rejection, Appellants note that the claims "require
that the composition adheres to bone, skin, or other hard tissue." Appeal Br.
10-12. However, Appellants argue that in each of the cited references, the
"polymer composition does not adhere to bone, skin, or other hard tissue.
Therefore, the cited patent does not anticipate or render obvious Appellants'
claimed invention." Id. at 10-13.
We do not find Appellants' arguments persuasive of reversible error
in the Examiner's rejections. The Examiner has shown, and Appellants do
not contest, that the five cited references disclose chemical structures
obtained by the blending process of claim 1. Because the prior art structures
are produced by an identical or substantially identical process to that
specified in claim 1, the Examiner has established a prima facie case of both
anticipation and obviousness. See In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255 (CCPA
1977). ivioreover, the requirement in claim l that the "composition adheres
to bone, skin, or other hard tissue" is a functional limitation. If the Examiner
has reason to believe that a functional limitation asserted
to be critical for establishing novelty in the claimed
subject matter may, in fact, be an inherent characteristic
of the prior art, [the Examiner] possesses the authority to
require the applicant to prove that the subject matter
shown to be in the prior art does not possess the
characteristic relied on.
In re Schreiber, 128 F.3d 1473, 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (quoting In re
Swinehart, 439 F.2d 210, 213 (CCPA 1971)). Therefore, the burden has

shifted to Appellants "to show that the prior art structures did not inherently

4

Appeal2015-002993
Application 13/406,489
possess the functionally defined limitations" of the claimed compositions.
Id.

In response to the Examiner's findings and conclusions, Appellants
have merely pointed to the claim limitations and stated that those limitations
are not disclosed by each prior art reference. Appeal Br. 10-13. Appellants'
arguments lack any citation to factual evidence to distinguish the structure of
the prior art compositions from the composition of claim 1, or to rebut the
Examiner's conclusion that the functional limitation is inherently found in
the prior art references. See id. Therefore, we are not persuaded of
reversible error in the Examiner's decision to reject claim 1 as set forth in
rejections I-V. For the same reasons, we find no reversible error in the
Examiner's decision to reject claims 2-8.
DECISION
The Examiner's decision is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
AFFIRMED
