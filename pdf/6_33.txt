ANALYSIS
Rejection 1
The Examiner rejects Claims 29 and 30 as failing to comply with the
written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph. Ans. 2.
"[T]he test for [written description] sufficiency is whether the disclosure of
the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that
the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing
date." Ariad Pharm., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1351 (Fed. Cir.
2010).
Claim 29 recites, "The method of claim 26, further including forming
an interconnect structure over the conductive portion of the ACF." Appeal
Br. 85 (Claims Appendix). The Examiner maintains that claim 26 requires
"forming a conductive layer over the conductive portion of the ACF" and
that the Specification does not disclose having both a conductive layer and
an interconnect structure "over" the conductive portion of the ACF. Ans. 4-5. In the Examiner's view, either the conductive layer or the interconnect
structure must be "under the ACF." Id. We disagree.
Appellants persuasively explain that Paragraphs 66 and 67 of the
Specification and Figure 9h disclose forming an interconnect structure (230)
over the conductive portion of the ACF and that the interconnect structure
includes a conductive layer (RDL 232). Appeal Br. 9. Because the
conductive layer may be part of the interconnect structure (as shown in
Figure 9h) both the conductive layer and the interconnect structure may be
"over the conductive portion of the ACF" as described in the Specification.
Spec. i-f 66 ("a bottom-side build-up interconnect structure 230 is formed
over ACF 204 . . . . The build-up interconnect structure 230 includes an

6

Appeal2015-002952
Application 12/822,458
electrically conductive layer or RDL 232 .... ")(emphasis added). We
therefore do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 29.
The Examiner rejects claim 30 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph,
solely because of its dependency on claim 29. Final Act. 5. We thus also do
not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 30.
Rejection 2
The Examiner rejects claim 6 as indefinite under 35 U.S.C. § 112,
second paragraph. Final Act. 6. Claim 6 depends from claim 5 which
depends from claim 1. Claim 6 recites, "The method of claim 5, wherein the
semiconductor component includes bumps which are compressed into the
cured ACF." Appellants do not appear to dispute the Examiner's rejection
and agree that "one skilled in the art would understand that when making the
device shown in FIG 11, the curing step needs to occur after compressing
semiconductor die 254 into ACF 136 .... " Appeal Br. 14. We therefore
sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 6.
Rejections 3---6, Claim 1-7
The Examiner rejects claim 1 as obvious over Paik in further view of
Choi, Su, and Yamano. Ans. 2-3. Appellants argue that none of these four
references teaches or suggests "removing the temporary carrier to expose the
conductive portion of the cured ACF under the bumps" as recited by claim
1. Appeal Br. 30.

The Examiner acknowledges that none of the references expressly
teaches this recited step. Final Act. 18. The Examiner concludes that this
recited step would have nonetheless been obvious in view of the teachings of
Choi, Su, and Yamano. Id. While the Examiner's underlying findings
might suggest that the recited step would be possible, the findings fail to
establish that a person of ordinary skill would have had reason to implement
7

Appeal2015-002952
Application 12/822,458
a method of making a semiconductor device where ACF is compressed (so
that it becomes conductive in the compressed area) under the bumps, cured,
and then exposed by removing a temporary carrier.
The Examiner's stated rationale for combining references also fails to
establish that a person of ordinary skill would have had reason to reach this
missing step. In particular, the Examiner states that a semiconductor die has
two problems: a need for electricity and a need to protect the die. Ans. 19.
The Examiner acknowledges that "[t]here are a variety of ways to solve both
problems." Id. Appellants' explanation of the four prior art references
establishes that these references solve these problems in ways that do not
involve the missing step: "removing the temporary carrier to expose the
conductive portion of the cured ACF under the bumps." Appeal Br. 17-30.
The present record lacks adequate reasoning based upon the four cited
references or otherwise as to why a person of skill in the art would have
chosen, among the variety of ways to solve the identified problems, to
implement the missmg step. This is particularly true given that the step at
issue is not taught by any of the references.
Accordingly, we do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claim 1.
The Examiner does not state that the additional three references applied to
dependent claims (Pogge, Pagaila, and Kim) further relate to the missing
step discussed above. See, e.g., Final Act. 28, 31, 34. Therefore, we also do
not sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 2-7, which all depend from
claim 1.
Rejections 3-6, claims 8-13
The Examiner rejects independent claim 8 as obvious over Paik in
further view of Choi, Su, and Yamano. Ans. 2. Independent claim 8 recites
"removing the carrier to expose the conductive portion of the ACF." Appeal
8

Appeal2015-002952
Application 12/822,458
Br. 80 (Claims Appendix). "The conductive portion" refers back to the
portion of the ACF compressed under the bumps earlier in the claim. Id.
Thus, this recitation is very similar to the claim 1 recitation discussed above.
Appellants argue that none of the four applied references "teach[ es] or
suggest[s] removing the carrier to expose the conductive portion of the ACF
or forming an interconnect structure on the encapsulant and conductive
portion of the ACF .... " Appeal Br. 48. The Examiner again acknowledges
the missing step but concludes that the step would have been obvious. Final
Act. 22.
For the reasons explained above with respect to claim 1, the
Examiner's conclusion is in error. We therefore do not sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claim 8 or its dependent claims 9-13.
Rejections 3---6, claims 14--20
The Examiner rejects independent claim 14 as obvious over Paik in
further view of Choi, Su, and Yamano. Ans. 2-3. Independent claim 14
recites "depositing an encapsulant over the semiconductor die to leave the
cured ACF under the contact pads exposed.... " Appeal Br. 82 (Claims
Appendix). Appellants argue that none of the four references teaches this
step (Appeal Br. 63), and the Examiner again acknowledges the missing step
but concludes the step would have been obvious (Final Act. 26).
For the reasons explained above with respect to claim 1, the
Examiner's conclusion is in error. We therefore do not sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claim 14 or its dependent claims 15-20.
Rejections 7-9, claims 26-30
The Examiner rejects independent claim 26 as obvious over Choi, Su,
and Yamano. Ans. 3. Independent claim 26 recites "compressing the ACF
beneath the semiconductor die to leave a conductive portion of the ACF
9

Appeal2015-002952
Application 12/822,458
opposite the semiconductor die exposed." Appeal Br. 84 (Claims
Appendix). Appellants argue that none of the references teaches this recited
step. Id. at 74. The Examiner's rationale for why this step would have been
obvious (Final Act. 36-37) is in error for the reasons explained above with
respect to claim 1. We therefore do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of
claim 26 or its dependent claims 27-30.

DECISION
For the above reasons, we affirm the Examiner's rejection of claim 6
under 35 U.S.C. § 112. We reverse the Examiner's rejection of claims 29
and 30 under 35 U.S.C. § 112. We reverse the Examiner's rejection of
claims 1-20 and 26-30 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a).
