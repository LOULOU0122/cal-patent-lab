CLAIMED INVENTION
"The present invention is generally related to online business
promotion, and more particularly, is related to a system and method for
providing promotional opportunities within a community" (Spec. 1: 10-12).
Claims 1, 9, 17, 20, and 45 are independent. Claim 1, reproduced below, is
representative of the subject matter on appeal.
1.
A system for providing promotional opportunities, the
system comprising:
a communication source comprising a computer-readable
medium and a computer-accessible network having a software
platform that supports a sale of a plurality of vouchers, said
software platform under operational control of a controlling
entity;
a voucher creation system in communication with the
communication source, the voucher creation system configured
to allow at least one voucher creating entity to negotiate with said
controlling entity terms of at least a first voucher of the plurality
of vouchers for sale and to create said first voucher of the
plurality of vouchers for sale through the software platform
based on said negotiated terms, said first voucher conferring a
right to claim goods or services;
a voucher purchasing element, within the software
platform and under operational control of the controlling entity,
for purchasing by the controlling entity at least the first voucher
from said at least one voucher creating entity; and
a voucher sales element, within the software platform,
configured to allow the controlling entity to offer said first
voucher for sale to at least one potential buyer,
wherein the voucher sales element is configured to provide
sufficient access to said at least one potential buyer to purchase
the first voucher from said controlling entity.

DISCUSSION
We have reviewed Appellant's arguments in the Briefs against the
Examiner's Answer and the Final Rejection, and we are not persuaded of
error. We adopt the Examiner's findings and rationale provided in the
Answer and Final Rejection as our own, and we note the following for
emphasis.

3

Appeal2014-002757
Application 12/192,799
Rejection I

Appellant argues independent claims 1, 9, 17, 20, and 45 as a group
(App. Br. 14--19). We select claim 1 as being representative. Thus,
claims 9, 17, 20, and 45 stand or fall with claim 1. 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
We are not persuaded by Appellant's assertion that the Examiner has
misinterpreted the claim term "voucher" (App. Br. 12). Appellant has not
cited to a definition from the Specification or provided persuasive evidence
to dispute the Examiner's proffered dictionary definition of "voucher" (see
Final Act. 3, citing Merriam-Webster's Dictionary) to support this assertion.
Instead, Appellant argues that the claims specify that the "first voucher"
confers a right to claim goods or services and "that a 'coupon' in no way
confers a right to claim goods or services" (App. Br. 13). But the Examiner
relies on Arganbright's teaching of "gift certificates," not coupons (see Final
Act. 5 (citing "Arganbright, at least col. 54:50-55:11, col. 59:55-67, col.
61:3-5, col. 61:48-57, col. 62:4--30 disclosing that the system supports the
sale of vouchers including gift certificates, all references herein to a
'product' or 'products' shall include a reference to vouchers including gift
certificates")). And indeed, the value of a "gift certificate" is to confer the
right to claim goods or services with it.
Appellant's argument that "nowhere does Arganbright provide any
teaching or suggestion that the marketing company purchases vouchers (or
even products, for that matter) from a voucher creating entity (e.g., a
merchant), based on negotiated terms, and offers that voucher for sale to
potential buyers" (App. Br. 15) is unpersuasive because Appellant is
attacking Arganbright individually; the rejection is based on the combined
4

Appeal2014-002757
Application 12/192,799
teachings of Arganbright, Macnish, and Habiby, not on any one of them
alone. See In re Merck & Co., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986)
(N onobviousness cannot be established by attacking the references

individually when the rejection is based on the teachings of a combination of
references). For instance, the Examiner acknowledges that "Arganbright
does not expressly disclose that the system supports negotiation of voucher
terms and creation of vouchers based on negotiated terms," and instead
relies on Macnish to cure this deficiency (Final Act. 6).
Appellant acknowledges that Macnish "teaches a voucher 'facilitator'
which allows merchants to submit voucher terms, and if acceptable to the
voucher facilitator, the system will create vouchers which can be sold from
the merchant to a customer," but Appellant argues that the combination fails
to provide any teaching or suggestion of a voucher creation element that
creates vouchers based on negotiations between the controlling entity and a
voucher creation entity" (App. Br. 16).
We are not persuaded of Examiner error because Appellant does not
adequately explain why Macnish's teaching of preparing a proposed
voucher 30 using the electronic voucher system 10 for being offered to the
facilitator 12, which "checks each proposed voucher 30 for economic value
(i.e., by comparing the cost of the voucher 30 to potential economic benefits
provided by the voucher 30) and to ensure that the duration of the offer will
be such that the customer 18 will have adequate time to take advantage of
the offer" before approving or rejecting the offer, does not teach or suggest
creating and negotiating the terms of a voucher (see Final Act. 6, citing
Macnish i-fi-1 40-41 ). Macnish discloses that "the merchant 14 is informed
that the proposed voucher 30 is unacceptable and steps 106 through 110
5

Appeal2014-002757
Application 12/192,799
repeat until the merchant 14 submits a proposed voucher 30 the voucher
facilitator 12 approves" (Macnish i-f 40). Appellant has not acted as her own
lexicographer to clearly set forth a definition of the term "negotiate" in the
Specification or the Briefs before us. Apart from disagreeing with the
Examiner's interpretation, Appellant has not offered persuasive reasoning or
evidence to dispute the Examiner's finding. Thus, the Examiner properly
determines that this disputed claim term carries its ordinary and customary
meaning (see Final Act. 3, citing Merriam-Webster Dictionary; see also Ans.
11-12). As such, we agree with the Examiner's finding that under a
broadest reasonable interpretation, one of ordinary skill in the art would
consider Macnish's voucher approval process discussed supra as reading on
the claimed voucher negotiation.
Appellant also argues:
The Examiner erroneously cites Habiby as disclosing 'a voucher
purchasing element, within the software platform and under
operational control of the controlling entity, for purchasing by
the controlling entity, at least the first voucher from said at least
one voucher creating entity,' as required by Appellant's
independent claim 1. Nowhere does Habiby disclose or suggest
that a controlling entity, having operational control of the
software platform, purchases vouchers from a voucher creating
entity and offers those vouchers for sale to potential buyers. In
fact, there is no single controlling entity in Habiby at all. Rather,
Habiby provides an IT solution for an industry (i.e.,
wholesalers/distributors of goods for contractors/sub-contractors
in construction projects) whereby wholesalers and distributors
can access aggregated product information from multiple
manufacturers that is stored in a master database of product
information.
App. Br. 17-18 (citing Habiby i-fi-138 and 45).

6

Appeal2014-002757
Application 12/192,799
The Examiner responds:
The Office Action cites Habiby because Habiby describes
the well-known business arrangement of a wholesale
distributorship. For example, at [0045] (cited in Office Action at
,-r 11 ), Habiby teaches:
"Sellers, for example, are wholesalers and distributors that
purchase and resell manufactured goods to contractors and
subcontractors ... Product manufacturers, for example, are
manufacturers who produce goods but do not sell them
directly to contractors and builders. Rather, they rely on
wholesalers and distributors as their distribution arms."
Thus, Habiby expressly teaches that middlemen purchase
goods for resale from the creators of those goods, and re-sell
them to consumers of the goods. When combined with art
teaching a computerized system for purchasing and re-selling
vouchers, the combination expressly supplies the missing link of
purchasing goods (e.g. vouchers) for resale from the
manufacturer of the goods. In the context of the combination, this
teaches the portion of the "voucher purchasing element"
underlined above.
ii..ns.

15-16.
We are likewise unpersuaded by Appellant's argument here. To

further understand the scope of the "voucher purchasing element," Appellant
directs us to the Specification (App. Br. 7, citing Spec. 6: 14--7:5). We find
this section of the disclosure describing the value of vouchers as related to
each entity, such that "Face Value" (F) is the dollar amount the voucher may
purchase in goods at the issuing entity 22, "Wholesale Value" (W) is the
price at which issuing entity 22 sells its vouchers to software platform 20,
and "Buyer Price" (B) is the price software platform 20 resells vouchers to
buyers 28 (Spec. 6: 14--19). After buying vouchers from the issuing entity at
wholesale and selling to buyers at retail, "the difference between Band W,
net of the Fees (B-W-Fees) is left for bounties to the company operating the
7

Appeal2014-002757
Application 12/192,799
software platform 20" (id. 6:22-24 ). In other words, software platform 20
reaps the benefits of being a wholesaler by reselling vouchers to buyers at a
profit, not unlike the teachings of Habiby, as asserted by the Examiner.
Furthermore, we note that independent claim 1 is directed to a system.
Although it is permissible, as Appellant does in claim 1, to recite features of
an apparatus using functional language, such functional language may not be
relied on for patentability if the prior art discloses or suggests structure
capable of performing the recited function. See In re Schreiber, 128 F.3d
1473, 1478-1479 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The portion of the Specification cited by
Appellant fails to disclose any structure corresponding to the "voucher
purchasing element." Appellant has made no showing here or offered any
argument, that the combination of the prior art fails to disclose or suggest
software configuring hardware capable of purchasing vouchers. In fact, there
is no objective evidence of record here that the structure and/or function of
the voucher purchasing element is altered or otherwise affected by being
under the operational control of the "controlling entity."
As such, we are not persuaded, on the present record, of error on the
part of the Examiner. According! y, we sustain the rejection of independent
claim 1, and independent claims 9, 3 17, 20, and 45, which fall with claim 1.

3

We note that Appellant uses the Reply Brief to introduce new arguments
with respect to claim 9 (see Reply Br. 7-8). "Any bases for asserting error,
whether factual or legal, that are not raised in the principal brief are waived."
Ex parte Borden, 93 USPQ2d 1473, 1474 (BPAI 2010) (informative); see
also Optivus Tech., Inc. v. Ion Beam Appl'ns. S.A., 469 F.3d 978, 989 (Fed.
Cir. 2006) ("[AJn issue not raised by an appellant in its opening brief ... is
waived.") (citing Becton Dickinson & Co. v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 922 F.2d 792,
800 (Fed. Cir. 1990)). The Examiner's findings as to claim 9 remain
unchanged from the Final Rejection, from which the instant appeal was
8

Appeal2014-002757
Application 12/192,799
We also sustain the rejection of dependent claims 2-5, 8, 10-12, 15, 16, 18,
19, 21-24, 26, 27, and 35--44, which are not separately argued except based
on their dependence on their corresponding independent claims (see App.
Br. 19).
Rejections 11-V

To the extent that Appellant contends that the teachings of Teague,
Van Luchene, Perry, and Sandhu do not cure the alleged deficiencies of the
combination of Arganbright, Macnish, and Habiby (see App. Br. 19-21 ), we
sustain Rejections II-V for the reasons discussed above.
DECISION
The Examiner's decision to reject claims 1--45 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a).
AFFIRMED

taken. In fact, the Examiner only addresses the insufficiency of Appellant's
arguments presented in the Appeal Brief with respect to claim 1 (see Ans. 4).
Appellant could have presented the newly introduced arguments in the
Appeal Brief. However, Appellant may not present arguments in a
piecemeal fashion, holding back evidence and arguments until an examiner
answers the original brief. This basis for asserting error is waived. See 37
C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
