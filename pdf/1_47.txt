Application 13/015,501
CLAIMED INVENTION
Appellants' claimed invention relates to "determining an entity's
share of economic contribution and environmental burden." Specification,
Title.
Independent claim 1, reproduced below with added bracketed matter,
is representative of the subject matter on appeal.
1. An electronic device, comprising:
a processor to:
[a]
estimate an entity's economic contribution related
to an activity;
[b]
estimate an aggregate economic contribution by
multiple entities related to the activity based on an
economic contribution factor related to the
activity;
[c]
determine the entity's share of the economic
contribution by the activity based on a comparison
of the entity's economic contribution and the
aggregate economic contribution;
[d]
estimate the entity's environmental burden related
to the activity based on an environmental burden
factor associated with the entity's performance of
the activity;
[e]
estimate an aggregate environmental burden of
multiple entities related to the activity based on an
aggregate environmental burden factor associated
with the multiple entities' performance of the
activity;
[f]
determine the entity's share of the environmental
burden caused by the activity based on a
comparison of the entity's environmental burden
and the aggregate environmental burden; and
[g]
provide the entity's impact, the entity's impact
being based on the entity's share of the economic
contribution related to the activity and the entity's
share of the environmental burden caused by the
activity.

ANALYSIS 4
As an initial matter, we note that Appellants argue independent claims
1, 6, and 11 as a group (Appeal Br. 6-11). We select claim 1 as being
representative. Thus, claims 6 and 11 stand or fall with claim 1. 3 7 C.F .R.
ยง 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
Appellants do not dispute the Examiner's findings as to limitations
[a]-[ f] of claim 1. The sole argument challenging the obviousness rejection
is whether Myers and Xu teach or suggest "provid[ing] an entity's impact,
the entity's impact being based on the entity's share of the economic
contribution related to an activity and the entity's share of an environmental
burden caused by the activity" (Appeal Br. 6), as called for in limitation [g].
Appellants contend that "[n]either Myers nor Xu teach[] an entity's
impact based on two or more factors, let alone the economic contribution
and environmental burden, as recited in the pending claims." Id. at 7. This
contention however attacks the references individually. Appellants fail to
address the Examiner's actual rejection to establish an insufficiency in the
combined teachings of the references. The Examiner does not rely on either
reference alone as teaching an entity's impact based on two factors, but
instead relies on the combined teachings of Myers and Xu in rejecting
limitation [g]. See Final Action 6-8. Nonobviousness cannot be established
by attacking the references individually when the rejection is predicated

The Examiner withdrew the indefiniteness rejection as to claims 1-10 in
response to Appellants' after final claim amendments filed on Oct. 7, 2013.
See Advisory Action (mailed Oct. 17, 2013). The Examiner states that "no
response has been provided in regards to the 35 USC 112(b) paragraph"
(Answer 2), but such observation is deemed moot in light of the Examiner's
withdrawing the rejection in the Advisory Action.

upon a combination of prior art disclosures. See Jn re Merck & Co. Inc., 800
F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986).
Appellants acknowledge that Myers discloses an entity's share of
aggregate economic contribution, and Xu discloses an entity's share of
aggregate environmental burden, but argue that there is no teaching,
suggestion, or guidance in either Myers or Xu "of [an] 'entity's impact based
on the entity's share of economic contribution and the entity's share of
environmental burden." Appeal Br. 8. We disagree.
Xu is directed to a management system accessible to a large number
of "entities [that] upload information relevant to determining a measure of
environmental impact." Xu, Abstract. Because entities may either want to
reduce energy usage to save money or be required to reduce emissions due
to governmental caps, Xu provides a tool that helps each entity evaluate its
performance against others to determine initiatives and strategies to meet the
company's target for emissions, energy usage, or other goal. Xu ,-r 5. In
order to determine the environmental impact for each entity, Xu utilizes
information related to resource consumption to calculate measures of
environmental impact, such as costs of energy used, types/amounts of
products manufactured and emissions, raw input product usage (e.g., paper,
metals, etc.), and costs of various pertinent resources. Xu i-fi-1 17, 26; see also
Final Action 6-7 (citing Xu).
The Examiner is arguing that it would have been obvious to provide an
entity's impact, based on the entity's share of economic contribution and
environmental burden, given what Xu and Myers disclose.
Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art at the time the invention was made to also analyze
environmental impacts, as taught by Xu, with the method and
4

Appeal2014-004350
Application 13/015,501
system of Myers since the claimed invention is merely a
combination of old elements, and in the combination each
element merely would have performed the same function as it
did separately, and one of ordinary skill in the art would have
recognized that the results of the combination were predictable.
Final Action 7-8; see also Answer 5-7 (mailed Dec. 18, 2013).
Therefore, the position the Examiner is taking is that the combination
of cited prior art disclosures would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to
the claimed subject matter, including a processor providing "the entity's
impact, the entity's impact being based on the entity's share of the economic
contribution related to the activity and environmental burden caused by the
activity." Appellants have not addressed the findings and position the
Examiner is in fact taking or pointed to any insufficiency with the
Examiner's articulated rationale for the combination.
Instead, Appellants assert that "a skilled artisan would not consult
both Myers and Xu simultaneously to provide the claimed 'impact."'
Appeal Br. 9; see also Reply Br. 3 (filed Feb. 18, 2014). In particular,
Appellants argue that "Myers does not address environmental issues because
environmental issues were not considered by Myers to be relevant to a
supply chain economy .... [and] Xu does not address the economic
contributions of the organization or group of clients to an activity because
Xu is only concerned with how an entity affects the environment compared
to its peers." Appeal Br. 9-10.
However, both Myers and Xu gather entity data to benchmark against
other entities for measuring the value added share of the entity to determine
the impact of each potential key participant in the supply chain or amongst
other entities. See Myers i-f 32. And as discussed above, Xu also utilizes
5

Appeal2014-004350
Application 13/015,501
economic cost data as well as energy usage and emissions data to calculate
the environmental impact of an entity. Xu ,-r 17. For instance, Xu discloses
that the cost of various resources are as pertinent as the consumption of
those resources in providing the environmental impact of an entity. Id.
Therefore, we are not persuaded by Appellants' assertion because the
rejection of claim 1 is based on obviousness, so all the disclosures in the
cited references must be considered not in isolation, but rather, for what the
combined teachings would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the
art.
For these reasons, Appellants' arguments are unpersuasive as to error
by the Examiner in rejecting claim 1. Therefore, we sustain the rejection of
independent claim 1, and independent claims 6 and 11, which fall with
claim 1. We also sustain the rejection of dependent claims 2-5, 7-10, and
12-15, which are not argued separately except based on their dependence on
claims 1, 6, or 11.
DECISION
The decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1-15 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. ยง 1.136(a).
AFFIRMED
