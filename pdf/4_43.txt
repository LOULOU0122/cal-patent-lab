DECISION ON APPEAL

Appeal2015-001764
Application 13/106,619
STATEMENT OF CASE
Introduction

Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
Final Rejection of claims 1-5, 8, 9, 11, 14--18, 20, 22, and 23. We have
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). We affirm.
Exemplary Claim

Exemplary independent claim 1 under appeal, with emphasis added to
the disputed portions of the claim, reads as follows:
1. An optical receiver, comprising:

an optical hybrid configured to mix an optical signal
received at a first optical input port thereof with an optical
local-oscillator signal received at a second optical input port
thereof to generate first, second, third, and fourth mixed optical
signals at respective first, second, third and fourth optical
output ports thereof;
a first optical-to-electrical (O/E) converter including first
and second photo-detectors connected to receive optical signals
from the respective first and second optical output ports, the
first O/E converter having a first electrical port that outputs a
first electrical signal representative of a difference between
electrical signals produced by the respective first and second
photo-detectors;
a second O/E converter including third and fourth photodetectors connected to receive optical signals from the
respective third and fourth optical output ports, the second O/E
converter having a second electrical port that outputs a second
electrical signal representative of a difference between
electrical signals produced by the respective third and fourth
photo-detectors; and
an electrical power combiner connected to output a third
electrical signal that is proportional to a sum of a squared

value of the first electrical signal received from the first DIE
converter at a time t and a squared value of the second
electrical signal received from the second O/E converter at said
time t.
Examiner's Rejections

5,060,312; issued Oct. 22, 1991) and Fu, Yang, HIGH LINEARITY
PHOTODIODE ARRAY WITH MONOLITHICALLY lNTEGRATED WILKINSON
POWER COMBINER, pp. 1-3 (2010). Final Act. 4--12; Ans. 3-10.
(2) The Examiner rejected claims 2 and 15 as being unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Delavaux, Fu, and Lowery (US

(3) The Examiner rejected claim 8 as being unpatentable under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) over Delavaux, Fu, and Core (US 6,782,211 Bl; issued

Aug. 24; 2004). Final Act. 14--15; Ans. 12-13.
(4) The Examiner rejected claim 11 as being unpatentable under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) over Delavaux, Fu, and Wentzel, Andreas, NOVEL
BROADBAND WILKINSON POWER COMBINER, pp. 212-215 (2006). Final Act.
15-16; Ans. 13-14.

Application 13/106,619

Principal Issue on Appeal1

Based on Appellants' arguments in the Appeal Brief (App. Br. 6-9)
and the Reply Brief (Reply Br. 2-3), the following principal issue is
presented on appeal:
Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 1-5, 8, 9, 11, 14--18, 20, 22,
and 23 as being obvious over the base combination of Delavaux and Fu
because the combination fails to teach or suggest the optical receiver
including an electrical power combiner, as recited in representative
independent claim 1, and as similarly recited in the remaining claims 2-5, 8,
9, 11, 14--18, 20, 22, and 23?

ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejections (Final Act. 4--16) in light
of Appellants' contentions in the Appeal Brief (App. Br. 6-9) and the Reply
Brief (Reply Br. 2-3) that the Examiner has erred, as well as the Advisory
Action mailed May 29, 2014 and the Examiner's response (Ans. 14--18) to

1

Appellants present detailed arguments on the merits only with respect to
claim 1 (App. Br. 6-8; Reply Br. 2-3). Appellants rely on the arguments
presented for claim 1 as to the patentability of remaining claims 3-5, 9, 14,
16-18, 20, 22, and 23, which contain similar features (App. Br. 8).
Accordingly, we select claim 1 as representative of the group of claims
(claims 1, 3-5, 9, 14, 16-18, 20, 22, and 23) rejected for obviousness over
the combination of Delavaux and Fu.
With regard to the rejection of (i) claims 2 and 15 over the
combination of Delavaux, Fu, and Lowery, (ii) claim 8 over the combination
of Delavaux, Fu, and Core, and (iii) claim 11 over the combination of
Delavaux, Fu, and Wentzel, Appellants rely on the arguments already
presented with respect to representative claim 1 (App. Br. 8-9).

Appeal2015-001764
Application 13/106,619
Appellants' arguments in the Appeal Brief. We disagree with Appellants'
conclusions.
With regard to representative claim 1, we concur with the conclusions
reached by the Examiner, and adopt as our own: (1) the findings and
reasons set forth by the Examiner in the action from which this appeal is
taken (Final Act. 4--7; Ans. 3-5); (2) the reasons set forth by the Examiner in
the Advisory Action mailed May 29, 2014; and, (3) the reasons set forth by
the Examiner in the Examiner's Answer in response to Appellants' Appeal
Brief (Ans. 14--18). We highlight and amplify certain teachings and
suggestions of the references, as well as certain of Appellants' arguments as
follows.
Appellants' Specification acknowledges that a Wilkinson power
combiner is old and well-known (Spec. 9:22-10:29). Furthermore, we agree
with the Examiner that Fu (Fig. 1; Section I. Introduction, i-f 2; Section B.
Linearity Measurement, i-f 2) teaches or suggests a Wilkinson power
combiner as recited in claim 1 (Final Act. 6; Ans. 5). In light of our
agreement with the Examiner's findings, as well as Appellants'
acknowledgement that Wilkinson power combiners are known, Appellants'
contentions that the combination of Delavaux and Fu fails to teach or
suggest the optical receiver set forth in claim 1 are not persuasive.
In view of the foregoing, we sustain the obviousness rejections of
claims 1, 3-5, 9, 14, 16-18, 20, 22, and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) based
on the base combination of Delavaux and Fu. For similar reasons, we also
sustain the Examiner's obviousness rejections of claims 2, 8, 11, and 15
(which rely on the same base combination of Delavaux and Fu).

Application 13/106,619
CONCLUSION
The Examiner has not erred in rejecting claims 1-5, 8, 9, 11, 14--18,
20, 22, and 23 as being obvious over the base combination of Delavaux and
Fu because the base combination teaches or suggests the optical receiver
including an electrical power combiner, as set forth in claim 1.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejections of claims 1-5, 8, 9, 11, 14--18, 20, 22, and
23 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) are affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l). See 37 C.F.R.
§§ 41.50(f), 41.52(b) (2013).
