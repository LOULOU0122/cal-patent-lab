coated with a plasma-resistant material such as a thermally sprayed yttria
coating. (Spec. 3 [0010], 4 [0015].) It is said to be desirable to remove the
upper chamber section for cleaning, but the yttria coating is easily damaged,
and it is sometimes preferred to replace the chamber section rather than
cleaning it. (Id. at 3 [0010].) Moreover, alignment is critical for proper
gasket sealing (Id. at 3 [0011].) Furthermore, the substantial amount of
material in the upper chamber section is said to result in a large thermal
mass that can store thermal energy from the plasma process for extended
periods and make control of multi-step multi-temperature processing more
difficult. (Id. at 3 [0012]-4 [0013].) In particular, the Specification
indicates that "heat-flow variations originating from the upper chamber
section may cause the substrate temperature to vary outside narrow recipe
parameters." (Id. at 4 [0013].)
The inventors seek patent protection for a replaceable upper chamber
section 300, shown in Fig. 3, below right.

Application 12/748,141
Upper chamber section 300 is said to have improved thermal characteristics
due to thermal choke 314-the thin-walled section of the cylinder that
minimizes thermal transfer to the bottom chamber section 250-compared to
the substantially constant-width wall of the prior art upper chamber section
illustrated supra in Fig. 2 (left).
Claim 1 is representative and reads:
A replaceable upper chamber section of a plasma reaction
chamber in which semiconductor substrates can be processed,
compnsmg:
a monolithic metal cylinder having
a conical inner surface which has a largest diameter at a
lower end thereof,
an upper flange extending horizontally outward away from
the conical inner surface and
a lower flange extending horizontally away from the
conical inner surface;
an upper annular vacuum sealing surface adapted to seal
against a dielectric window of the plasma chamber;
a lower annular vacuum sealing surface adapted to seal
against a bottom section of the plasma chamber;

a thermal choke at a lower portion of the cylinder effective
to minimize transfer of heat across the lower vacuum
sealing surface,
the thermal choke defined by a thin metal section having
a thickness of less than 0.25 inch and extending at
least 25 % of the length of the conical inner surface; and
a thermal mass section at an upper portion of the cylinder,
the thermal mass section defined by a portion of the
cylinder between the conical inner surface, an outer
surface extending vertically from the upper flange, a
horizontal surface extending from an upper end of the
thermal choke, and the upper flange.

B.

Discussion
Findings of fact throughout this Opinion are supported by a

preponderance of the evidence of record.
Lam urges that the Examiner has provided no reason to combine the
teachings of Sharpless, which are directed to a plasma processing chamber
comprising a replaceable upper chamber section, with the teachings of
Knowlton, which are directed to a heat transfer delay provided by a heat
transfer device in propellant, pyrotechnic, and explosive devices. Lam
argues that the mere prior existence of thermal chokes-a fact that Lam
acknowledges-does not suffice to demonstrate that it would have been
obvious to incorporate such a thermal choke as a thin (less than 0.25 inch
thick) walled section of the upper chamber section as required by the
appealed claims. (See Br. 6, 2d para.; App. Br. 7, 3d para.)
The weight of the evidence of record, including the references and the
rationale of the rejections, supports Lam's arguments. The optimized
chamber sections described by Sharpless reportedly weigh about 80% less
than the prior art upper chamber sections (Sharpless 3 [0029]) and also have
a thermal mass about 80% less than the [then] existing non-optimized top
pieces (id. at [0042]). Although we note that Sharpless teaches that the
relative small thermal mass allows temperature corrections by the cooling
system to be "substantially synchronized" (id.), the Examiner has not
directed our attention to any substantial concern expressed by Sharpless with
the adverse consequences of heat transfer in the prior art upper chamber
sections or in the lighter, ergonomically optimized chamber sections. The

only place such concerns are expressed in the present record appear to be in
the disclosure of the '141 Specification. Hindsight, however, is not an
appropriate basis for the legal conclusion of obviousness.
The Examiner makes no findings regarding Ikeda, which is directed to
thermal reaction furnaces for semiconductor substrate processing (Ikeda,
col. 1, 11. 5-11 ), or regarding any of the other references, that cure the
fundamental defect of the attempted combination of teachings of Sharpless
and Knowlton.
We therefore reverse the rejections of record.
C.

Order
It is ORDERED that the rejection of claims 1-3, 5-13, 15-20 is

reversed.
