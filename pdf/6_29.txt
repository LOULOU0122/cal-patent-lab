DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Leonard J. Strnad III and Yoshihiko Kodama ("Appellants") 1 appeal
under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 21-26,
28-31, 38, and 39 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as anticipated by Kawabuchi
(US 2005/0166635 Al, pub. Aug. 4, 2005). 2 The Board has jurisdiction
over the appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM-IN-PART.

CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claims 21 and 38 are independent. Claim 21 illustrates the subject
matter on appeal, and it recites:
21.

A circular-cut gemstone comprising:
a girdle having a top edge and a lower edge;
a crown extending from the girdle's top edge at a crown
angle less than that [of] an ideal-cut-diamond crown angle so that
a substantial portion of light entering one side of the crown exits
an opposite side of the crown; and
a pavilion extending downward from the girdle's bottom
edge and having a pavilion angle the same as an ideal-cutdiamond.

Appeal Br. 13 (Claims App.).
ANALYSIS

Claims 21, 22, 25, 26, 28-31, 38, and 39
In rejecting claim 21, the Examiner finds Kawabuchi' s Figure 1B
discloses a circular cut gemstone comprising a girdle, a crown extending
from the girdle's top edge at a crown angle, and a pavilion extending from
the girdle's bottom edge at a pavilion angle. Final Act. 3. The Examiner
determines an ideal-cut-diamond crown angle is 34.5°, and an ideal-cutdiamond pavilion angle is 40.75°. Id. at 7; see also Spec. i-f 5; and Appeal
Br. 3. The Examiner finds Kawabuchi' s Figure 22 discloses combining a
crown angle within the range of about 17 .5-26.0° with a pavilion angle of
40.75°, and notes the entire range of about 17.5-26.0° is less than 34.5°.
Final Act. 3--4, 7-8.
Appellants argue "Kawabuchi does not disclose a specific example
wherein the pavilion angle is 40.75° and the crown angle is less than 34.5°."

2

Appeal2014-007755
Application 12/449,079
Appeal Br. 4; see also id. at 6-8 (providing extensive discussion of
Kawabuchi disclosure). Appellants contend Atofina v. Great Lakes Chem.

Corp., 441 F.3d 991 (Fed. Cir. 2006), controls here, because Kawabuchi's
Figure 22 "may disclose a range of pavilion angles, but it does not disclose

'specific examples"' of pavilion angles. Id. at 5 (emphasis added).
Appellants acknowledge the Kawabuchi disclosure of a 40.75° pavilion
angle in a "conventional ideal cut diamond," but note such a diamond has a
crown angle of 34.5°, outside of the claimed range of less than 34.5°. Id. at
6; see Kawabuchi i-fi-f 13, 119.
Appellants also contend the claimed crown angle range of less than
34.5° "overlap[ s] only a small portion" of the range of about 17 .5-26.0°
illustrated in Kawabuchi's Figure 22. Appeal Br. 4 (annotating
Kawabuchi' s Figure 22 to illustrate the overlap). According to Appellants,
Kawabuchi' s range of crown angles fails to disclose the claimed range of
crown angles with "sufficient specificity" to constitute anticipation. Id. at 8
(citing MPEP § 2131.03 andAtofina, 441 F.3d at 999). Appellants note, in

Atofina, the court considered a claimed temperature range of 330°C to
450°C, and a prior art reference disclosing a temperature range of 100°C to
500°C. Id. at 8. Appellants further note, despite the claimed range in

Atofina occupying more than a quarter of the prior art range, the court still
found "given the considerable difference between the claimed range and the
range in the prior art, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the prior
art describes the claimed range with sufficient specificity to anticipate this
limitation of the claim." Id. at 8-9 (quoting Atofina, 441 F.3d at 999).
Appellants analogize the overlap presented here-a claimed range of less

3

Appeal2014-007755
Application 12/449,079
than 34.5°, and a prior art disclosure range of about 17.5°-26.0°-as being
"certainly much less" than the overlap presented in Atofina. Id. at 9.
The Examiner responds that Kawabuchi discloses the specifically
claimed pavilion angle of 40.75° as a "common" pavilion angle. Final
Act. 7-8. 3 The Examiner finds Kawabuchi's Figure 22 discloses, for such a
common pavilion angle, a crown angle range of about 17 .5-26.0°, which is
less than 34.5°. Id.; Ans. 3. Concerning the Atofina decision, the Examiner
notes Kawabuchi's disclosed crown angle range (about 17.5-26.0°) falls
entirely within the limitation of claim 21 (less than 34.5°), so the prior art "is
not outside of the range" as it was inAtofina. Id. at 5.
We agree with the Examiner that Kawabuchi anticipates claim 21,
including a pavilion angle of 40.75° (i.e., the same as an ideal-cut-diamond
pavilion angle) in combination with a crown angle of less than 34.5° (i.e.,
less than an ideal-cut-diamond crown angle). First, considering the pavilion
angle, Kawabuchi' s Figure 22 discloses a pavilion angle range of
37.5--41.0°, which includes the claimed 40.75°. Kawabuchi, Fig. 22,

i-fi-f 151-156. That disclosure, taken in isolation from the rest of
Kawabuchi' s disclosure, would invoke Atofina' s discussion of the
circumstances under which a prior art disclosure of a genus (37.5--41.0°) is
necessarily a disclosure of every species that is a member of the genus
(40.75°). See Atofina, 441 F.3d at 998-99.

3

The Examiner cites Kawabuchi' s paragraph 11 in support of this finding.
Final Act. 8. That paragraph does not discuss pavilion angles. We
understand, as Appellants did, that the Examiner meant to refer to the 40.75°
pavilion angle of a Tolkowsky "ideal cut" diamond. Kawabuchi i-fi-f 13, 119;
see Appeal Br. 6.
4

Appeal2014-007755
Application 12/449,079
However, Kawabuchi's disclosure is not limited to Figure 22.
Kawabuchi also discloses a prior art "ideal cut" diamond proposed by
Tolkowsky, having a pavilion angle of 40.75° and a crown angle of 34.5°.
Kawabuchi i-f 13. Kawabuchi then goes on to discuss its inventive diamond
having a pavilion angle between 37.5° and 41°, with a corresponding crown
angle in specified ranges which all fall below the ideal cut diamond's crown
angle of 34.5°. Id. i-fi-125-29, 151-156 & Fig. 22. Kawabuchi further
compares the light reflecting performance of its inventive diamond with
Tolkowsky's ideal cut diamond, in several ways. Id. i-f 119 & Figs. 3-9,

,-r 124 & Figs. 10-13, ,-r 148 & Figs. 19-20, ,-r 151 & Fig. 21. These
comparisons include determining "the amount of effective visual-perceptible
reflection rays" with pavilion angles of 40° and 41 °, such that "preferable
results can be obtained if the pavilion angle (p) is not larger than
41 degrees." Id. i-fi-1151, 154 & Fig. 21.
From that disclosure, a person of ordinary skill in the art would
appreciate the significance of the ideal cut diamond's pavilion angle
of 40.75°, and further appreciate that Kawabuchi discloses a pavilion angle
of 40.75° as a species within its overall inventive range of 37.5--41°. The
disclosure of a pavilion angle of 40.75°, albeit in connection with the ideal
cut diamond having a crown angle of 34.5°, distinguishes the present case
from Atofina. This is particularly so given the heavy focus of Kawabuchi on
comparing the light reflecting performance of its inventive diamond with
Tolkowsky's ideal cut diamond, and nonetheless choosing a range for its
inventive diamond that includes the pavilion angle of Tolkowsky' s ideal cut
diamond. The prior art reference at issue in Atofina disclosed only a
temperature range, and did not disclose any specific temperature within that

5

Appeal2014-007755
Application 12/449,079
range. See Atojzna, 441 F.3d at 1000 ("The disclosure is only that of a
range, not a specific temperature in that range.")
Comparing the claimed crown angle being less than 34.5° (with a
pavilion angle of 40.75°) with Kawabuchi's disclosure of a crown angle
range of about 17.5-26.0° (with a pavilion angle of 40.75°) also does not
invoke Atofina. The decision in Atofina concerned two different disclosures
in the prior art reference: a broader temperature range of 100-500°C, and a
narrower "preferred" temperature range of 150-350°C. Atofina, 441 F.3d at
999. The prior art's broader temperature range entirely encompassed the
claimed temperature range of 330-450°C, while the prior art's narrower
temperature range slightly overlapped the claimed temperature range. Id. at
999-1000. Neither situation is presented here, where the prior art range of
about 17 .5-26.0° is entirely encompassed within the claimed range of less
than 34.5°-that is, this case is the opposite of that presented by the broader
prior art temperature range at issue in Atofina. 4 There is no "considerable
difference" or "slight[] overlap[]" between Kawabuchi's disclosed range and
the claimed range, as there was in Atofina. Id. The present case is more
akin to other decisions where the prior art disclosure was entirely
encompassed by the claimed range, and which hold the claim to be
anticipated. See, e.g., Titanium Metals Corp. ofAm. v. Banner, 778 F.2d
775, 781 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (finding a prior art disclosure of a titanium base
alloy containing 0.25% Mo and 0.74% Ni to anticipate a claim reciting 0.20.4% Mo and 0.6--0.9% Ni).

4

Indeed, Kawabuchi' s Figure 22 indicates that, regardless of what pavilion
angle within the critical range of 37.5--41.0° is chosen, the crown angle is
always less than 34.5°.
6

Appeal2014-007755
Application 12/449,079
For the foregoing reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 21 and its
dependent claims 22, 25, 26, and 28-31 as anticipated by Kawabuchi.
Appellants present the same arguments for the patentability of independent
claim 38 and its dependent claim 39 (Appeal Br. 3-11; Reply Br. 2-5), so
we likewise sustain the rejection of those claims as anticipated by
Kawabuchi.
Claims 23 and 24

Appellants present additional argument for the patentability of
dependent claims 23 and 24 over Kawabuchi. Appeal Br. 11. Claim 23
indirectly depends from independent claim 21 to specify the crown angle is
less than 23 °, and claim 24 depends from claim 23 to specify the crown
angle is less than 19°. Id. at 13 (Claims App.). Appellants contend
Kawabuchi does not disclose a specific example with a pavilion angle
of 40.75° and a crown angle within the narrower ranges of dependent
claims 23 and 24, and no showing has been made of "sufficient specificity."
Id. at 11.

The Examiner finds Figure 22 of Kawabuchi discloses a "range of
known crown angles for a pavilion angle of 40.75 degrees is from
roughly 17-25 degrees." Final Act. 5.
As discussed above, the decision in Atofina concerned a prior art
reference disclosing "a preferred temperature range of 150 to 3 50°C that
slightly overlap[ped]" the claimed temperature range of 330 to 450°C.
Atofina, 441 F.3d at 999-1000. The court stated:

[T]hat slightly overlapping range is not disclosed as such, i.e., as
a species of the claimed generic range of 330 to 450°C.
Moreover, the disclosure of a range of 150 to 350°C does not
constitute a specific disclosure of the endpoints of that range, i.e.,
7

Appeal2014-007755
Application 12/449,079
150°C and 350°C, as [the patent challenger] asserts. The
disclosure is only that of a range, not a specific temperature in
that range, and the disclosure of a range is no more a disclosure
of the end points of the range than it is of each of the intermediate
points. Thus, [the prior art reference] does not disclose a specific
embodiment of the claimed temperature range.
Id. at 1000. That reasoning controls here, where Kawabuchi's disclosure of

a crown angle of about 17.5-26.0° slightly overlaps the claimed crown
angles of less than 23° (claim 23) or less than 19° (claim 24). In this regard,
the claimed crown angle ranges extend down almost to 0°. See Appeal
Br. 13 (parent claim 22 recites that the crown "extends upward" from
girdle). Thus, we do not sustain the rejection of claims 23 and 24 as
anticipated by Kawabuchi.
DECISION
The Examiner's decision to reject claims 21-26, 28-31, 38, and 39 as
anticipated by Kawabuchi is affirmed as to claims 21, 22, 25, 26, 28-31, 38,
and 39, and reversed as to claims 23 and 24.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended, under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
