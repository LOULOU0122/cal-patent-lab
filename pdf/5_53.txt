DECISION ON APPEAL

A.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

The Appellants filed an appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from a final rejection
of claims 107-116, 118-120, 122-128, and 132-135. 1 We have jurisdiction under
35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

Claim 131 was cancelled in an Amendment dated August 23, 2013. According to
the Examiner, "the second after-final amendment filed 23 August 2013 is entered"
and "reflects the status of the claims presented in the Brief." Examiner's Answer
dated October 31, 2013 ("Ans."), at 2.

Appeal2014-003702
Application 13/019,422
The only claim at issue on appeal is claim 107 which stands rejected under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Koo et al. 2 in view ofYazawa et al. 3 and
Hafeman et al. 4 ' 5
Claim 107 is reproduced below from the Claims Appendix of the Appeal
Brief dated August 19, 2013 ("Br."). The limitation at issue is italicized.
107. A method of sequencing a plurality of template nucleic acids,
the method comprising:
disposing a plurality of template nucleic acids in a reaction
chamber associated with a sensor, the sensor comprising a field effect
transistor to produce an output signal responsive to an ion
concentration in the reaction chamber;
introducing a first solution with a known ion concentration into
the reaction chamber and adjusting a bias voltage applied to a
reference electrode to determine an operating voltage;

introducing a second solution into the reaction chamber and
applying the operating voltage to the reference electrode in
communication with the second solution, the second solution
including a known nucleotide; and
measuring the output signal to detect ions generated through
incorporation of the known nucleotide into one or more primers that
are hybridized to at least one of the plurality of template nucleic acids.

Claims 108, 112, 122-124, 126-128, 132, 134, and 135 also stand rejected under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Koo in view ofYazawa and Hafeman.
The remaining claims on appeal stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Koo in view of Y azawa and Hafeman, and further in view of
additional prior art identified on pages 9-19 of the Examiner's Answer. The
rejection of claims 107-116, 118-120, 122-128, and 131-135 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 112, first paragraph, based on the written description requirement, was
withdrawn in the Examiner's Answer. Ans. 19.

DISCUSSION

The Examiner finds, and the Appellants do not dispute, that Koo discloses a
method of sequencing a plurality of nucleic acids comprising the step of disposing
a plurality of template nucleic acids in a reaction chamber associated with a field
effect transistor (PET) sensor wherein a PET output signal is detected based on the
change in ion concentration resulting from incorporation of a known nucleotide
into a primer. Ans. 4.
The Examiner finds Koo does not teach using a bias voltage with a reference
electrode as recited in claim 107. Nonetheless, the Examiner finds, and the
Appellants do not dispute, that Y azawa teaches the known technique of using a
bias voltage with a reference electrode. Ans. 4; see also Br. 24 ("Yazawa et al.
describes that a predetermined bias potential is supplied to a reference electrode
173 within the sample solution, in order to enhance the sensitivity of the IS PET
[ion sensitive field effect transistor] 184."). The Examiner concludes, and the
Appellants do not dispute, that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
in the art to modify the method of Koo to include the step of "predetermining and
applying an operating voltage via use of a bias voltage with a reference electrode
in accordance with the teachings ofYazawa." Ans. 4.
The Examiner finds "[ w ]hile Yazawa et al teach the operating voltage
predetermined from the bias voltage (i.e., potential; paragraph 0038), neither Koo
et al nor Y azawa et al specifically teach the operating voltage is predetermined
from a first solution with a known ion concentration" as recited in claim 107. Ans.
5; see Br. 24 ("Yazawa et al. does not describe the manner in which the bias
potential of the reference electrode 173 is selected.").
Turning to Hafeman, the Examiner finds:

3

Appeal2014-003702
Application 13/019,422
Hafeman et al teach a method wherein a bias voltage (i.e., potential)
of known magnitude is determined via use of a first solution of known
concentration of an analyte whose concentration will change during
measurement, based on standards of known concentrations of the
analyte (i.e., including a first solution), which has the added advantage
of calibrating the sensor (i.e., circuit; column 9, lines 40-50).
Ans. 5; see also Final 28-29 ("Hafeman et al specifically teach determination of
the operating voltage from a first solution with a known ion concentration (i.e., a
standard concentration of the analyte )").
The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art to modify the method of Koo in view of Yazawa "to further
comprise predetermining the operating voltage via use of a first solution of known
analyte (i.e., ion) concentration in accordance with the teachings of Hafeman."
Ans. 5. The Examiner finds one of ordinary skill in the art would have been
motivated to make the proposed modification "because said modification would
have resulted in a method having the added advantage of calibrating the sensor as
explicitly taught by Hafeman." Ans. 6 (citing Hafeman, col. 9, 11. 40-50).
The Appellants do not dispute that Hafeman calibrates the disclosed device
using known concentrations of analyte. See Br. 25-26. Rather, the Appellants
argue that "the [Examiner's] rationale suggesting that one of ordinary skill would
seek to use the calibration step of the electrode-based device of Hafeman ... to
determine the bias potential applied to the reference electrode 173 of the ISFETbased device [ofYazawa] ... does not make sense." Br. 27.
The fact that the devices disclosed in Yazawa and Hafeman may be different
does not weigh against the Examiner's conclusion of obviousness. As discussed
above, there is no dispute on this record that a predetermined bias potential is
applied to the reference electrode in Yazawa to determine an operating voltage as
4

Appeal2014-003702
Application 13/019,422
claimed. The Examiner merely relies on Hafeman to show that calibrating a
device using a solution of known ion concentration was known in the art at the
time of the Appellants' invention. See Ans. 23. The Appellants do not direct us to
any credible evidence or provide any technical reasoning showing that one of
ordinary skill in the art could not have used a solution, as disclosed in Hafeman, to
calibrate or determine the operating voltage ofYazawa's ISFET-based device. See
KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007) ("The combination of
familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does
not more than yield predictable results."). Therefore, the Appellants' argument is
not persuasive of reversible error.
For the reasons set forth above and reasons provided in the Examiner's
Answer, the§ 103(a) rejection of claim 107 is sustained.
The Appellants do not present arguments in support of the separate
patentability of any of the remaining claims on appeal. Therefore, the § 103 (a)
rejections of claims 108-116, 118-120, 122-128, and 132-135 are also sustained.
C.

DECISION

The Examiner's decision is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this
appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l).
AFFIRMED
