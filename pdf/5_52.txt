CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
"The invention relates to cathodes used in microbial fuel cells
(MF Cs), which are used for producing electricity; and microbial electrolysis
cells (MECs ), which are used to produce hydrogen." (Spec.

iJ 6. ) 3

Claim 1,

reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:
1.

An apparatus, comprising:
a reaction chamber having a wall defining an interior of
the reaction chamber and an exterior of the reaction chamber;
exoelectrogenic bacteria disposed in the interior of the
reaction chamber;
an aqueous medium having a pH in the range of 3-9,
inclusive, the aqueous medium comprising an organic substrate
oxidizable by exoelectrogenic bacteria, the aqueous medium
disposed in the interior of the reaction chamber;
an anode at least partially contained within the interior of
the reaction chamber; and
a brush or mesh cathode comprising stainless steel, nickel
or titanium, the cathode at least partially contained within the
interior of the reaction chamber.

REJECTIONS 4
Claims 1-17 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Logan and Tomita. (Ans. 3.)
Claims 1-17 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double
patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1--4 and 6-29 of U.S. Patent No.
7,491,453 in view of Tomita. (Id. at 7.)

OPINION
Findings of fact throughout this Opinion are supported by a
preponderance of the evidence of record.
The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the Examiner has
shown that a "mesh cathode" is present in or would have been obvious in
view of the applied prior art. (See App. Br. 3.)
It is undisputed that Logan teaches every limitation of claim 1 except

a "mesh cathode." (See App. Br. 2-3.) The Examiner finds that Tomita
discloses a fuel cell having "first and second cathodes" which "may be
formed" from "porous metallic materials" such as "foamed metal or alloy
prepared from nickel, copper, silver, gold, nickel-chrome alloy, and stainless
steel." (Final Act. 3 (citing various portions of Tomita including iJ 25).)
Finding that the claim limitation "mesh cathode" is not defined in the '945
Specification and that the recited "mesh cathode" and the prior art foamed

Examiner's Answer mailed November 10, 2014 ("Ans."). The Examiner
has withdrawn the indefiniteness rejection of claims 9 and 16 and they are
therefore not subject to this appeal. (See Ans. 6.) Examiner's Answer
mailed November 10, 2014 corrects a previous version mailed October 23,
2014 which contains an incorrect filing date of Appellants' Brief. (See PT090C form attached to Ans.)

metal are "both ... porous structures," the Examiner concludes that a skilled
artisan would have found the claim obvious. (Ans. 8.)
Because neither the '945 Specification nor Appellants defines the
claim term "mesh cathode," we apply the broadest reasonable interpretation
of claim terms, consistent with the specification, as would be understood by
one of ordinary skill in the art. In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech Ctr., 367 F.3d
1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted). Where, as here, the
Specification does not explicitly define a term, the term should be given its
ordinary meaning consistent with the Specification. In re Translogic Tech.,

Inc., 504 F.3d 1249, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
In this case, the '945 Specification provides that a mesh cathode such
as "titanium mesh cathode 30" includes"[ w ]ires 32." (Spec. ,-i 86.) Figure 3
illustrating a cross section view of titanium mesh cathode 30 is reproduced
below.

Figure 4 of the '945 Specification, illustrating "a tubular embodiment
of a stainless steel, nickel or titanium mesh cathode" 50 in which the "mesh
is shown at 56" is also reproduced below. (Id. iii! 32, 89.)

FIG. 4
Consistent with the texts and drawings in the '945 Specification, the
claim term "mesh" is ordinarily understood to mean "an interwoven or
interlocked structure." (See Academic Press Dictionary of Science &
Technology, 1992.) Given the ordinary meaning of this term and the fact
that the Examiner has not explained why the prior art "foamed metal" would
have suggested a metal "mesh" - "an interwoven or interlocked structure" of
metal - to the skilled artisan, we find that the Examiner committed
reversible error in rejecting claim 1 on this basis.

Appeal2015-003147
Application 12/649,945
To the extent that Tomita additionally teaches using "a mesh of metal
such as titanium" to form a current collector of a fuel cell (Tomita iJ 53
(cited in Ans. 8)), the Examiner has not explained why a titanium mesh
current collector would have suggested to a skilled artisan a titanium mesh
cathode as recited in claim 1. The Examiner argues that Example 6 of the
'945 Specification shows that a "cathode" should be defined "as including a
current collector (stainless steel mesh, SS)" to form "a single cathode
structure." (Ans. 8 (citing Spec. iJ 233).) The Examiner, however, does not
explain why his definition is consistent with other embodiments in the '945
Specification which do not expressly include a current collector as part of a
single cathode structure. We accordingly decline to read into claim 1 the
particular embodiment of Example 6.
We further note that Tomita teaches using "foamed nickel, foamed
stainless steel" for forming a cathode as well as using "a mesh of metal such
as titanium" for forming a current collector. (Tomita iii! 25, 53 (cited in Ans.
8).) Tomita's disclosure of "foamed metal" and metal mesh as distinct terms
for distinct parts of a fuel cell indicates that they are different structures each
serving a unique purpose in Tomita's fuel cell.
Appellants do not argue that the double patenting rejection is in error
and express a willingness to file a terminal disclaimer. (App. Br. 4.) The
obviousness-type double patenting rejection is therefore summarily
affirmed.

DECISION
The Examiner's obviousness rejection of claims 1-17 is reversed.
The Examiner's double patenting rejection of claims 1-17 is affirmed.
