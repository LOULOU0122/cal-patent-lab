Application 12/944,053
Technology Center 2100

Before DAVID M. KOHUT, JENNIFER L. McKEOWN, and
SCOTT E. BAIN, Administrative Patent Judges.
McKEOWN, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the Examiner's
decision to reject claims 1-24. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We affirm.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants' invention generally relates to "publishing a web electronic
advertisement at a specified location of a webpage which matches the
sentiment of the context surrounding the specified location." Spec. i-f 1.
Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed invention and reads as follows:
1.
A method of publishing specified content at a
specified location of a webpage, the method comprising:

Appeal2015-007407
Application 12/944,053
performing sentiment analysis by at least one computer
processor upon the context surrounding the specified location
where specified content is to be published, the sentiment analysis
determining a sentiment tendency of the context surrounding the
specified location, the sentiment tendency based on at least one
of statistical learning and dictionary matching; and
selecting whether or not to publish the specified content at
the specified location of the webpage based on the determined
sentiment tendency of the context surrounding the specified
location.
THE REJECTIONS
The Examiner rejected claims 1---6, 8, 9, 11-18, 20, 21, 23, and 24
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable by Farago (US 2007/0083611 Al;
pub. Apr. 12, 2007) and Tian (US 2007/0245375 Al; pub. Oct. 18, 2007).
Final Act. 3-15.
The Examiner rejected claims 10 and 22 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Farago, Tian, and Repas (US 2011/0099076 Al; pub. Apr.
28, 2011). Final Act. 16-17.
The Examiner rejected claims 7 and 19 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Farago, Tian, and Mei (US 2010/0153219 Al; pub. June
17, 2010). Final Act. 18-20.

ANALYSIS
THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION BASED ON FARAGO AND TIAN

Claims 1-6, 8, 9, 11-18, 20, 21, 23, and 24
Based on the record before us, we are not persuaded the Examiner
erred in rejecting claims 1---6, 8, 9, 11-18, 20, 21, 23, and 24 as unpatentable
over Farago and Tian.

2

Appeal2015-007407
Application 12/944,053
Appellants assert that the combination of Farago and Tian fails to
teach or suggest "performing sentiment analysis by at least one computer
processor upon the context surrounding the specified location where
specified content is to be published" and "selecting whether or not to publish
the specified content at the specified location of the webpage based on the
determined sentiment tendency of the context surrounding the specified
location." App. Br. 6-9. In particular, Appellants allege that Farago does
not perform analysis upon the context surrounding a specified location or
that the "advertisement is based on a context surrounding a specified
location of a webpage." App. Br. 7 (emphasis omitted).
We disagree. As the Examiner explains, Farago describes analyzing
the context of the multimedia items, e.g., video, surrounding the specified
location where the advertisement is to be published. Final Act. 3.
Appellants appear to emphasize the "specified location" language of the
claim but fail to persuasively explain why the analysis of the video, which
surrounds the specified location where the advertisement is published, is not
analysis at the recited surrounding the specified location. In other words, the
video surrounds the specified location by playing prior to or next to the
advertisement. As such, we find Appellants' argument unpersuasive.
Additionally, Appellants argue that the reason to combine Farago and
Tian "has been improperly gleaned from Appellants' own disclosure." App.
Br 9. More specifically, Appellants assert that,
The Examiner argues the modification of Farago with the
teachings of Tian would be obvious since, "This would have
been desirable for the purpose of determining emotional context
of content in order to provide more appropriate, relevant
supplemental content such as audio based on context/mood of

3

Appeal2015-007407
Application 12/944,053
content disclosed by (D2, 0035-0042)." FOA, p. 6. However,
there is no such teaching in Tian.
App. Br. 10.
This argument, however, ignores express teachings of Tian. As the
Examiner explains, paragraph 6 of Tian states that
there has come a desire to further enhance the user's experience
. . . one to way to improve user's experience is to deliver
background music that is appropriate to the text being delivered
[by matching the same mood or emotional qualities, thus]
disclosing and providing the motivation for combination of
[Farago and Tian].

Ans. 10-11 (citing Tian i-f 6). Therefore, we are not persuaded of error in the
Examiner's reasons to combine Farago and Tian.
Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above and by the Examiner,
we sustain the rejection of claim 1, as well as claims 2---6, 8, 9, 11-18, 20,
21, 23, and 24, not argued with particularity.

THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION BASED ON FARAGO, TIAN, AND REPAS

Claims 10 and 22

Appellants do not present any separate arguments of patentability for
claims 10 and 22, but rather rely on the arguments presented for claim 1.
See App. Br. 15. For the reasons discussed above, we find these arguments

unpersuasive. Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of claims 10 and 22.

THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION FARAGO, TIAN, AND MEI

Claims 7 and 19

With respect to claims 7 and 19, Appellants contend that "Farago does
not contemplate determining a context surrounding a specified location of a

4

Appeal2015-007407
Application 12/944,053
webpage, and more particularly, a portion or page block of a webpage where
the specified location is located." App. Br. 12.
The Examiner, however, relies on Mei for teaching dividing a
webpage into a plurality of page block and extracting a primary page block.
See Final Act. 18-19. One cannot show nonobviousness by attacking
references individually where the rejections are based on combinations of
references. See In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 426 (CCPA 1981); In re Merck
& Co., Inc., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

Similarly unpersuasive is Appellants' argument that "there is no
teaching in Mei of inferring a web page's main topic." App. Br. 13. Mei
expressly includes the step of "identify a main textual block." See, e.g., Mei
Fig. 7. As such, we are not persuaded that Mei fails to teach or suggest the
disputed limitation.
Finally, Appellants also assert that "the hypothetical combination of
Farago, Tian and Mei renders Farago unsatisfactory for its intended purpose
and/or changes its principle of operation." App. Br. 13-14. We find this
conclusory assertion unpersuasive. In particular, Appellants fail to provide
any persuasive support or explanation for this argument. For example,
Appellants do not identify what Farago's intended purpose or principle of
operation is or how it is rendered unsatisfactory or changed. See, e.g., App.
Br. 13-14.
Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of claims 7 and 19 as
unpatentable over Farago, Tian, and Mei.

DECISION
We affirm the Examiner's decision to reject claims 1-24.
