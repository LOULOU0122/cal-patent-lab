Appeal2014-009966
Application 13/272,960 1
Technology Center 3700

Before NINA L. MEDLOCK, KENNETH G. SCHOPPER, and
ROBERT J. SILVERMAN, Administrative Patent Judges.
SCHOPPER, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from the rejection of claims 1
and 7-19. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.
BACKGROUND
According to Appellants, the "invention relates generally to external
defibrillators, and more specifically to AEDs and protocols which they carry
out." Spec. i-f 1.

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is Physio-Control, Inc.

CLAHvIS
Claims 1 and 7-19 are on appeal. Claim 1 is illustrative of the
appealed claims and recites:
1.

A defibrillator for defibrillating a patient, comprising:
a power source configured to store a charge;

an energy storage device configured to receive at least a
portion of the charge, in which at least a fraction of the charge
portion can be delivered from the energy storage device via
electrodes as a shock to defibrillate the patient;
a user interface; and
a controller configured to:
obtain multiple successive data sets on at least one
sensed physiological parameter of the patient,
perform an analysis on each of the multiple data
sets,
for each performed analysis, instruct delivery of at
least one of the shocks if the result of the analysis
meets a predetermined criterion,
adjust at least one duration that is subsequent to a
first duration, each duration including a time
interval between successive performed analyses,
based at least in part on the at least one sensed
physiological parameter, and
cause the user interface to instruct delivery of CPR
for at least one of the durations.
Br. 10.

REJECTIONS
1. The Examiner rejects claims 1, 7, 9-14, and 16-19 under

35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as unpatentable over Kroll 2 in view of
Callaway, 3 Snyder, 4 and Stickney. 5
2. The Examiner rejects claims 8 and 15 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Kroll in view of Callaway, Snyder, Stickney,
and Nova. 6
DISCUSSION
Rejection 1

Appellants group all claims together with respect to this rejection. See
Br. 7-8. We select independent claim 1 as representative of these claims.
With respect to claim 1, the Examiner finds that Kroll discloses an
automatic external defibrillator (AED), which includes instructing delivery
of CPR for different intervals based on whether ventricular fibrillation (VF)
is detected. Final Act. 5. Specifically, the Examiner finds that Kroll
discloses if VF is not detected, the system provides an instruction to perform
CPR, and that Kroll discloses "an optional embodiment wherein a 'few'
manual chest compressions are given after VF is detected but before
defibrillation therapy is applied (Sections [0062]) in order to 'prime the
pump' and increase the success rate of defibrillation therapy." Id. The
Examiner also finds, inter alia:

Application 13/272,960
Therefore it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the
device in the Kroll reference to include the capability of
prompting a user to deliver a shorter period of CPR if VF is
detected and a longer period of CPR if a non-shockable rhythm
is detected, as taught and suggested by Kroll and Callaway and
further evidenced by Snyder and Stickney, for the purpose of
increasing the success rate of defibrillation of patients suffering
longer periods of VF while also having the ability to maintain
basic cardiac function during periods of non-shockable rhythms.
Id. at 6-7.
Appellants argue "that Kroll does not appear to teach anything
pertaining to the recited adjusting of CPR durations because there can be no
adjusting of CPR durations in situations where there are no CPR durations,
and there appear to be within the teachings of Kroll no CPR durations at all
in situations where VF is present." Br. 8 (emphasis omitted). More
specifically, Appellants argue that Kroll does not indicate that the "prime the
pump" chest compressions relied on by the Examiner are delivered after it is
determined that VF is present, i.e., Appellants assert that there is no
indication that these chest compressions are performed after the analysis
step 310 and determination that VF is present in the process of Kroll' s
Figure 3. Id.
We are not persuaded of error by Appellants' argument. With respect
to the "prime the pump" chest compressions cited by the Examiner, Kroll
states that the device may include an instruction "prompting the rescuer to
administer manual chest compressions to the patient prior to automatically
administering [medium voltage therapy (MVT)]" because "a few manual
chest compressions [may be necessary] before MVT can give effective
electrical CPR." Kroll i-f 62. Although, Kroll does not specifically tie this

Appeal2014-009966
Application 13/272,960
description to the process outlined in Figure 3, we find, contrary to
Appellants' assertion, that Kroll does provide an indication that these
manual chest compressions would be performed after step 310 in Figure 3
because this figure indicates that MVT is only administered in the situation
where the analysis at step 310 is performed and VF is detected. See Kroll
Fig. 3. Thus, we find that Kroll at least suggests providing a "few manual
chest compressions" after it is determined that VF is present. Further, we
note that the rejection does not rely on Kroll exclusively for disclosing
prompting a user to deliver a shorter period of CPR if VF is detected as the
Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to provide that
functionality in light of the teachings of "Kroll and Callaway and [as] further
evidenced by Snyder and Stickney." See Final Act. 6-7. Based on the
foregoing, we conclude that Appellants have not shown any error in the
Examiner's findings or conclusion.
For these reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 1. Claims 7, 9-14,
and 16-19 have not been argued separately, and thus, we sustain the
rejection of those claims for the same reasons.
Rejection 2

With respect to the rejection of claims 8 and 15, Appellants rely on
the same arguments discussed above with respect to claim 1. Thus, for the
reasons discussed above, we also sustain the rejection of claims 8 and 15.

Application 13/272,960
DECISION
The rejections of claims 1 and 7-19 are affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED
