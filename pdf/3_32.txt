Before ALLEN R. MACDONALD, and ROBERT E. NAPPI, and ELENI
MANTIS MERCADER, Administrative Patent Judges.
PERCURIAM.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is a decision on appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) of the rejection
of claims 1, and 3 through 9.
We affirm.
INVENTION
The invention is directed to a data storage system in which an initial
remote region of a first remote storage device of a remote storage system not
matching a corresponding local region of a local storage device of a remote
local system is detected. Then, a subsequent remote region on the remote
storage system matching the initial remote region is identified and the data
in the initial region is replaced with data from the subsequent remote region.
See Specification, para. 5.

Appeal2015-002989
Application 13/535,621
Claim 1 is illustrative of the invention and reproduced below:
1. A method performed by a processor, comprising:
detecting an initial remote region of a first remote storage
device of a remote storage system not matching a corresponding local
region of a local storage device of a local storage system, the remote
storage system including a plurality of remote storage devices each
including remote regions having a one-to-one correspondence with
local regions of the local storage device;
identifying a subsequent remote region included in one of the
remote storage devices of the plurality of remote storage devices of
the remote storage system matching the initial remote region by
searching a target subset of each of the remote regions; and
replacing data in the initial remote region with data from the
identified subsequent remote region.
REJECTIONS AT ISSUE
The Examiner has rejected claims 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103(a) as unpatentable over Fujibayashi (US 2003/0131278), Natanzon
(US 8,108,634 Bl, issued Jan. 31, 2012) and Vaikar (US 8,055,614 Bl,
issued Nov. 8, 2011). Final Act. 2---6. 1
The Examiner has rejected claim 6 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as
unpatentable over Fujibayashi, Natanzon, Vaikar and Reynolds (US
2008/0021936 Al, pub. Jan. 24, 2008). Final Act. 6-7.
The Examiner has rejected claim 7 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as

Appeal2015-002989
Application 13/535,621
ISSUES
Appellant argues on pages 12 through 15 of the Appeal Brief that the
Examiner's rejection of independent claim 1 is in error: These arguments
present us with the following issues:
a) Did the Examiner err in finding the combination of the
Fujibayashi, Natanzon, and Vaikar references teaches identifying
subsequent remote regions included in one of the remote storage
devices of the plurality of remote storage devices of the remote
storage system matching the initial remote region by searching the
target subset of each of the remote regions and replacing data in
the initial remote region with data from the identified subsequent
remote region?

ANALYSIS
We have reviewed the Examiner's rejections in light of Appellant's
contentions that the Examiner has erred. Further, we have reviewed the
Examiner's response to Appellant's arguments. The Examiner provides a
comprehensive response to Appellant's arguments on pages 3 through 9 of
the Answer. We have reviewed the Examiner's claim interpretation and the
cited portions of the references relied upon by the Examiner to support the
finding that Vaikar in combination with Fujibayashi and Natanzon teaches
the disputed claim limitation. We concur with the Examiner's claim
interpretation and findings and adopt them as our own. Accordingly, we
sustain the Examiner's rejection of independent claim 1 and claims 3
through 5, 8 and 9 which are grouped with claim 1.

Appeal2015-002989
Application 13/535,621
On pages 15 and 18 of the Appeal Brief~ Appellant addresses the
rejection of claims 6 and 7, by arguing that the additional references used in
the rejection don't make up for the deficiencies in the rejection of claim 1.
As discussed above we are not persuaded of error in the rejections of claims
6 and 7 and we sustain the rejection of these claims.

DECISION
The decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1, and 3 through 9 is
affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
