BACKGROUND
The subject matter on appeal relates to a method for producing
degradable polymeric particulates, which may be used in subterranean
applications such as well bore applications (Specification, hereinafter
"Spec.," iJ 2). Representative claim 1 is reproduced from the Claims
Appendix (Claims App.) to the Appeal Brief with key limitations
highlighted in italics:
1.
A method comprising: providing a degradable
polymer selected from the group consisting of: poly( Ecaprolactones ); poly(hydroxy ester ethers);
poly(hydroxybutyrates); poly( anhydrides ); polycarbonates;
poly( orthoesters ); poly( amino acids); poly( ethylene oxides);
poly(phosphazenes ); poly ether esters; polyester amides;
polyamides; and combinations thereof;
providing one solvent, wherein the one solvent is an
aqueous fluid selected from the group consisting offresh water,
salt water, brine, seawater, and combinations thereof,
combining the degradable polymer and the one solvent to
form a degradable polymer composition, wherein the
degradable polymer composition consists of the degradable
polymer and the one solvent;
allowing the one solvent to at least partially plasticize the
degradable polymer; and
applying sufficient shear to the degradable polymer
composition, wherein the degradable polymer composition
consists of the degradable polymer and the one solvent so that
degradable particulates begin to form.
Claim 15, the only other independent claim, also recites the same or similar
key limitations (Claims App.).

DISCUSSION
Re} ections I & II

The Examiner found that Todd describes methods for treating
subterranean formations with viscosified fluids comprising degradable
bridging agents in the form of polymeric particles (Final Act. 3). The
Examiner acknowledged, however, that Todd does not disclose the method
for making the polymeric particles (id.). The Examiner then relied on Casad
as disclosing a method "meeting the providing, combining and shearing
methods of the [claims]" (id. at 3--4). The Examiner concluded: "It would
have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art ... to include in Todd
the use of the method of Casad since it is recognized in the art as a suitable
method for making the desired particles of Todd" (id. at 4). Furthermore,
the Examiner appreciated that Casad describes organic solvents-not a
water-based solvent as required by the claims-in the preparation of the
degradable particulates, but nonetheless concluded (id.):
It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the

art ... to replace the organic solvents of Casad with water since
it is recognized in the art that both functionalize as suitable
9

Again, it appears that the Examiner inadvertently included withdrawn
claims 11-14, 18, and 20 in the statement of rejection.

solvents for polylactic acid polymers (including their
copolymers with glycolic acid) particles used in subterranean
formations.
The Appellants contend that the Examiner failed to articulate "any
motivation or other apparent reason known to a person of skill in the art for"
combining the references in the manner as proposed by the Examiner (Br.
8). The Appellants argue that, contrary to the Examiner's assertions, the
water-based solvents recited in the claims have not been shown to be
"equivalents" and, in fact, using a water-based solvent in the preparation of
the degradable polymer particulates would be "expressly against" Casad' s
teachings that water would hydrolyze and thus begin degradation of the
polymer particulates (id. at 8-10).
We agree with the Appellants that the Examiner's rejection is not
well-founded. Casad describes a method of making degradable polymeric
particulates by subjecting a mixture of polymer and organic diluent (and
optionally a dispersing agent) to shearing conditions at elevated
temperatures to form the degradable particulates (col. 4, 1. 65-col. 5, 1. 15;
Example 1). Casad states that the organic diluent "is inert to the polymer
and does not adversely affect the formation" of the degradable particulates
(col. 4, 11. 27-29).
Contrary to the Examiner's stated position, the relied-upon evidence
and/or reasoning fall short of establishing that organic diluents and waterbased solvents would have been considered by a person having ordinary skill
to be interchangeable in Casad and/or Todd. The Examiner did not direct us
to any teaching in Casad, Todd, or Erbstoesser, or provide other persuasive
evidence or technical reasoning, establishing that a water-based solvent
would satisfy the requirements disclosed in Casad, including the formation

5

Appeal2013-006631
Application 11/522,345
of a polymer dispersion under elevated temperatures and shearing
conditions-not polymer degradation. Thus, the Examiner failed to
demonstrate that a person having ordinary skill in the art would have
reasonably expected that a water-based solvent can be used successfully
under conditions of sufficient shear "so that degradable particulates begin to
form," as recited in claim 1. Indeed, Casad would appear to suggest the
opposite because it teaches that, under the temperature conditions
contemplated for the preparation of the degradable polymers, the polymers
would hydrolyze and degrade in the presence of water to form oil and watersoluble monomers and dimers rather than form "degradable particulates," as
required by the claims (col. 3, 11. 23-43). Although the Examiner surmises
that the hydrolysis would be "minor" (Ans. 3), that position is not supported
by objective evidence or acceptable technical reasoning and is therefore
insufficient to support a prima face case of obviousness.
For these reasons, we cannot uphold Rejections I and II.

Rejections III & IV
Relying on a Terminal Disclaimer filed October 31, 2012, the
Appellants had argued previously that the double patenting rejections were
overcome (Pre-Appeal Brief Request for Review filed October 31, 2012, at
1). The Examiner did not object to the Terminal Disclaimer, which appears

to have been "APPROVED" on November 7, 2012, nor dispute the
Appellants' contention that the rejections were overcome (Ans. 2--4; Notice
of Panel Decision from Pre-Appeal Brief Review mailed December 3,
2012). Therefore, these rejections appear to have been mooted and,
accordingly, we decline to reach Rejections III and IV.
