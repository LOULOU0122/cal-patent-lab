Application 12/795,904
THE CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claim 21, reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject
matter.
21. An amusement ride system, comprising:
an amusement ride; and
a fa9ade at least partially covering or adjoining said
amusement ride, wherein said fa9ade comprises an advertising
billboard located on a surface of said [fa9ade].
REJECTIONS
The following rejections, as presented in the Examiner's Answer, are

DISCUSSION

Rejection 1: Claims 21, 26, 29, and JO-Anticipation by Stromberg
The Examiner finds that Stromberg discloses all the limitations of
these claims. Ans. 2-3. 1 In doing so, the Examiner construes the claim term
"amusement ride" to be "any object that transports passengers." Id. at 3.
The Examiner explains the "term 'amusement' does not add any positive
structure and is a relative term" and "[a] car ride could be considered an
'amusement ride' for certain people or children." Id.
Appellants do not dispute the Examiner's finding that Stromberg
discloses the recited fa9ade. Ans. 2; Reply Br. 3-5. Appellants submit that
Stromberg discloses moveable platform 7 that is enclosed and moves
between a sidewalk level and a raised position at the level of an elevated
bus. Reply Br. at 3--4. Appellants, however, assert that "[t]here is no
language in Stromberg that discloses that the moveable platform 7
corresponds to an amusement ride." Id. at 4. Relying on dictionary
definitions of "amusement park" and "amusement ride," Appellants argue
that the "Examiner is transmogrifying the meaning of the claimed
amusement ride to such a degree that the Examiner has arrived at a
conclusion that no reasonable person would reach." Id.

1

The Examiner issues new grounds of rejection of all pending claims in the
Answer. See Ans. 2-7. Appellants have elected to maintain this appeal by
filing a Reply Brief. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.39(b)(2).
3

Appeal2014-007564
Application 12/795,904
As stated by Appellants, Stromberg's moveable platform 7 is an
enclosed vehicle that transports passengers. Although Stromberg's
moveable platform 7 is not specifically described as transporting people in
an amusement park, Appellants do not assert the transit system described in
Stromberg could not be used to transport people in an amusement park. See
Stromberg, col. 7, 11. 51-56 ("the system finds application in any
environment where it is necessary to move people from one location to
another."). We note that Appellants' Specification does not define
"amusement ride," but does indicate that the claims are not limited to the
specific structures disclosed. Spec. i-f 24 ("It should be appreciated by those
skilled in the art that the conception and the specific embodiment disclosed
may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other
structures."). We also note that Appellants have not addressed the
Examiner's assertion that riding a vehicle outside of an amusement park can
constitute "an 'amusement ride' for certain people or children." For all the
foregoing reasons, Appellants' argument that Stromberg's moveable
platform 7 is not an "amusement ride" is not persuasive.
The Examiner's finding that Stromberg anticipates claim 21 is
supported by a preponderance of the evidence and we sustain the rejection.
In contesting the new ground of rejection based on anticipation by
Stromberg, Appellants do not provide any separate arguments for the
patentability of dependent claims 26, 29, and 30. See Reply Br. passim.
Therefore, we also sustain the rejection of claims 26, 29, and 30, which fall
with claim 21, on the same basis. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv) (allowing
the Board to decide the appeal as to a ground of rejection of a group of
claims argued together on the basis of a representative claim).

Rejection 2: Claims 13, 21, 24, 26-28, 33, 36, and 38--4{}-()bviousnessBarber

The Examiner rejects independent claim 13 as obvious in light of
Barber. Ans. 4. In so doing, the Examiner finds Barber discloses all the
limitations of claim 13, including the fa9ade. Id.
Appellants contend the Examiner has not construed fa9ade consistent
with the Specification and, therefore, Barber's element 22 does not
correspond to the claimed fa9ade. Reply Br. 5---6. Appellants next contend
the claimed phrase "thereby enhancing consumer interest in said billboard
device ... is a structural limitation not an intended use", as the Examiner
asserts, because the claim recites that the advertising billboard is "located on
a surface of said fa9ade." Id. at 7. Appellants do not dispute that Barber's
4x4 sign is an advertising billboard, but contend the 4x4 sign is supported
above the bridge rather than "located on the surface of bridge 22" as
required by claim 13. Id. at 8. 2 For the following reasons, we sustain the
rejection of claim 13.
We initially address Appellants' argument that the Examiner did not
properly consider the Specification when construing "fa9ade." We give
claim terms their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the
Specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art.
See In re Suitco Surface, Inc., 603 F.3d 1255, 1259---60 (Fed. Cir. 2010); In
re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1054--55 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Although the claims

are interpreted in light of the Specification, limitations from the

Although not specifically stated by Appellants, we understand the
contentions in the Reply Brief regarding claim 13 to be Appellants' response
to the new ground of rejection in the Answer.
5

Appeal2014-007564
Application I2/795,904
Specification are not read into the claims. Jn re Van Geuns, 988 F.2d I I8I,
I I84 (Fed. Cir. I993).
Appellants' Figure I illustrates fa9ade I 40 as comprising a structure
with ornamentation to simulate an environment for the vehicle system, i.e., a
drinking glass. In this embodiment, vehicle I80 proceeds down tower I20
and behind or into fa9ade I40. Spec. i-f I 7. In Appellants' Figure 2, fa9ade
229 comprises a structure with ornamentation to simulate an environment
for the vehicle system, i.e., a racetrack. Spec. i-f 20. In this embodiment,
vehicle 250 proceeds on a track through openings 220 and 230 in fa9ade
229. Spec. i-f 20. In Appellants' Figure 3, fa9ade 340 comprises a structure
surrounding the vehicle system without ornamentation relating to the
specific environment for the tower ride disclosed in Figure 3. In this
embodiment, vehicle 380 proceeds down tower 320 and into fa9ade 340.
Spec. i-f 22. Based on the foregoing, we determine that a person of ordinary
skill in the art would reasonably construe fa9ade to be a structure that may
comprise ornamentation simulating an environment for a vehicle system that
accommodates a vehicle passing through it, behind it, or into it.
Barber's element 22 is a bridge through which vehicle I2 passes.
Barber Fig. IA. Barber's bridge accommodates vehicles I2 passing through
it. Id. Based on our construction of fa9ade, Appellants do not apprise us of
error in the Examiner's finding that element 22 may reasonably considered
to be a fa9ade.
Appellants' contention that the 4x4 sign is not located on a surface of
the fa9ade is not persuasive. The 4x4 sign is supported by posts that are part
of the rear-side surface of element 22. Barber, Fig. IA. The posts
supporting the 4x4 sign extend from the bottom of the structure near the

6

Appeal2014-007564
Application 12/795,904
vehicle track continuously to the 4x4 sign. Id. Consequently, the
Examiner's finding that the 4x4 sign is located on a surface of the fa9ade is
supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Because the 4x4 sign is
located on a surface of the fa9ade, it enhances consumer interest in the
billboard device. Therefore, we sustain the rejection of claim 13.
Appellants do not address the new ground of rejection of claim 21 as
unpatentable in light of Barber separately from the rejection of claim 13.
See Reply Br. passim. Consequently, we sustain the rejection of claim 21 in

light of Barber. 3
With respect to claims 24 and 36, the Examiner finds that "[t]he
amusement ride of Barber is considered a roller coaster." Ans. 4--5. The
Examiner reasons that claim 24 does not recite particular "structural
components of the roller coaster," and "one of ordinary skill in the art would
simply incorporate any suitable ride to accommodate any particular
environment." Id. at 10. Appellants contend that modifying Barber to
incorporate a roller coaster would change the principal of operation of
Barber because the result would no longer be a "portable amusement ride
that incorporates a multi-function trailer." Reply Br. 9-10. Appellants
merely make this assertion, but do not offer any evidence or persuasive
technical reasoning to support a conclusion that a roller coaster cannot be
incorporated into a portable amusement ride that includes a multi-function

3

To the extent that Appellants implicitly intend to rely on arguments in the
Appeal Brief regarding claim 21, i.e., that Barber does not disclose a fa9ade
and the advertising billboard is not located on a surface of the fa9ade
(Appeal Br. 11-14), those arguments are not persuasive for the same reasons
stated above for claim 13.
7

Appeal2014-007564
Application 12/795,904
trailer, or that it would involve more than ordinary skill in the art to do so.
Consequently, we sustain the rejection of claims 24 and 36.
Appellants do not address the new ground of rejection of claim 33 as
unpatentable in light of Barber separately from the rejection of claim 13.
See Reply Br. passim. Consequently, we sustain the rejection of claim 33 in

light of Barber. 4
Appellants do not address the new ground of rejection of claims 26
and 38 as unpatentable in light of Barber separately from claims 21 and 33.
See Reply Br. passim. Consequently, we sustain the rejection of claims 26

and 38 in light of Barber. 5
Dependent claims 27 and 28 recite that the vehicle when traveling
"resembles a mass of fluid" and "resembles a droplet of mercury"
respectively. Appeal Br. 41 (Claims App.). Claims 39 and 40 contain the
same recitations. Id. at 42. The Examiner rejects these claims as directed to
matters of "ornamentation only which have no mechanical function [and]
cannot be relied [on] to patentably distinguish the claimed invention from
the prior art." Ans. 5. The Examiner further explains that the claimed
recitations are "a matter of one's perception." Id. at 11.
Appellants contend that having a traveling vehicle resemble a mass of
fluid or a droplet of mercury relates to mechanical function not
ornamentation. Reply. Br. 10-11. The Specification does not describe any
4

To the extent that Appellants implicitly intend to rely on arguments in the
Appeal Brief regarding claim 33, i.e., that Barber does not disclose a fa9ade
and the advertising billboard is not located on a surface of the fa9ade
(Appeal Br. 17-19), those arguments are not persuasive for the same reasons
stated above for claim 13.
5
In the Appeal Brief, Appellants also do not argue separately for the
patentability of claims 26 and 38. Appeal Br. 14, 19.
8

Appeal2014-007564
Application 12/795,904
structure or mechanical function beyond the structure and function of the
vehicle without surface ornamentation that results in the moving vehicle
resembling a mass of fluid or droplet of mercury. Rather, the Specification
discloses the "vehicle 180 [can] be ... painted to resemble a mass of fluid."
Spec. i-f 17. Consequently, the fact that the vehicle may resemble a mass of
fluid or a droplet of mercury results from surface ornamentation painted on
the vehicle without any structural or functional change to the vehicle.
Surface ornamentation that has "no mechanical function whatsoever" cannot
be relied on to support patentability of apparatus claims. In re Seid, 161
F.2d 229, 231(CCPA1947). Appellants thus do not apprise us of error in
the rejection of claims 27, 28, 39, and 40. We sustain the rejection of these
claims.

Rejection 3: Claims 31-33, 38, and 41--44-0bviousness--Stromberg

With respect to independent claim 33, Appellants contend the
Examiner's finding that Stromberg discloses an "amusement ride" is
erroneous. Reply Br. 12-14. For the reasons stated above in connection
with Rejection 1, Appellants' contention is not persuasive and we sustain the
rejection of claim 33 for the same reasons.
Claims 31 and 43 recite the "fa9ade comprises one or more
substantially transparent sections." Appeal Br. 41--42 (Claims App.). The
Examiner notes that Stromberg does not "specifically disclose one or more
substantially transparent sections on the fa9ade." Ans. 5. The Examiner
states that billboards "can be seen everywhere" and are known to be "made
of non-transparent material or color paints or transparent plastic or glass
panel illuminated with lights." Id. The Examiner concludes "it would have

9

Appeal2014-007564
Application 12/795,904
been a matter of design choice to provide the fa9ade (8) of Stromberg with
one or more substantially transparent panels to accommodate any particular
environment." Id. at 5---6. Appellants contend that Stromberg does not
disclose transparent sections of the fa9ade and the Examiner erred by not
citing any authority for the position that the required modification to address
this deficiency "is simply a matter of design choice." Reply Br. 2-3
(submitting that the only section of the Manual of Patent Examining
Procedure discussing "design choice" is directed to "a rearrangement of the
parts").
Stromberg discloses that advertisement panels 29 "may be simple
billboard surfaces." Stromberg, col. 7, 1. 20. Appellants do not dispute the
Examiner's finding that billboards made of non-transparent or transparent
material are ubiquitous and thus were well known in the art. This
undisputed finding in combination with Stromberg's disclosure of
advertisement panels that "may be simple billboard surfaces" supports the
Examiner's conclusion that choosing transparent materials for the
construction of the recited advertising billboard would be an obvious design
choice. Therefore, we sustain the rejection of claims 31 and 43.
Appellants group claims 32 and 44 together. Reply Br. 11-12.
Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv), we select claim 32 as representative
of this group, and claim 44 stands or falls with claim 32. Claim 32 recites
that the "transparent sections are used for a retail center." Appeal Br. 41
(Claims App.). The Examiner rejects claim 32 because "'retail center' is
merely an intended use of the transparent sections and the term itself does
not contain and/or require any structural feature." Ans. 6. Appellants
contend that the Examiner erred because Stromberg does not disclose that

10

Appeal2014-007564
Application 12/795,904
fa9ade 8 is used for a retail center. Reply Br. 12. Appellants' contention is
not persuasive because it does not address the Examiner's rejection that the
recitation is merely an intended use, and not a limitation that structurally
distinguishes the claims from Stromberg. Therefore, we sustain the rejection
of claims 32 and 44. 6
Appellants do not address the new ground of rejection of claims 38,
41, and 42 as unpatentable in light of Stromberg separately from claim 33.

See Reply Br. passim. Consequently, we also sustain the rejection of claims
38, 41, and 42 as unpatentable over Stromberg. 7

Rejection 4: Claims 22 and 34-0bviousness-Barber and Stengel
Claims 22 and 34 recite the "amusement ride comprises a tower ride."
Appeal Br. 40-41 (Claims App.). The Examiner notes that Barber does not
disclose a tower ride, but relies on Stengel for disclosing a tower ride and
indicates such rides are well known in the art. Ans. 6. The Examiner then
concludes it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to
"substitute the vehicle ride of Barber with the tower ride of Stengel for the
purpose of providing an alternative ride to accommodate any particular
environment." Id.
6

If the recitation "are used as a retail center" were construed as requiring a
positive method step of operating a retail center, claim 32 seemingly would
be reciting both an apparatus and method steps of using the apparatus, and,
thus, would be indefinite pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph.
See Ultimate Pointer v. Nintendo Co., LTD, 816 F.3d 816, 826 (Fed. Cir.
2016); IPXL Holdings, L.L.C. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 430 F.3d 1377, 1384
(Fed. Cir. 2005).
7
Appellants do not dispute the Examiner's assertion that arguments in the
Appeal Brief related to claims 38, 41, and 42 are considered moot in light of
the new grounds of rejection in the Answer. See Ans. 11; Reply Br. passim.

11

Appeal2014-007564
Application 12/795,904
Appellants contend that modifying Barber to incorporate a tower ride
would change the principal of operation of Barber because the result would
no longer be a "portable amusement ride that incorporates a multi-function
trailer." Reply Br. 15. Appellants merely make this assertion, but do not
offer any evidence or persuasive technical reasoning to support a conclusion
that a tower ride cannot be incorporated into a portable amusement ride that
incorporates a multi-function trailer or that it would involve more than
ordinary skill in the art to do so. As the Examiner states a sufficient
rationale for the combination supported by the cited references, we sustain
the rejection of claims 22 and 34.
Rejection 5: Claims 23 and 35--0bviousness-Barber and Kleimeyer
Claims 23 and 35 recite the "amusement ride constitutes a bungee
ride." Appeal Br. 40-41 (Claims App.). The Examiner notes that Barber
does not disclose a bungee ride, but relies on Kleimeyer for disclosing a
bungee ride. Ans. 7. The Examiner then concludes it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to "substitute the vehicle ride of
Barber with the bungee ride as taught by Kleimeyer for the purpose of
providing an alternative ride to accommodate any particular environment."
Id.

Appellants contend that modifying Barber to incorporate a tower ride
would change the principal of operation of Barber because the result would
no longer be a "portable amusement ride that incorporates a multi-function

offer any evidence or persuasive technical reasoning to support a conclusion
that a tower ride cannot be incorporated into a portable amusement ride that
incorporates a multi-function trailer or that it would involve more than

ordinary skill in the art to do so. As the Examiner states a sufficient
rationale for the combination supported by the cited references, we sustain
the rejection of claims 23 and 35.
Rejection 6: Claims 25 and 37--0bviousness-Barber and Castille
Appellants do not address the new ground of rejection of claims
25 and 37 as unpatentable in light of Barber and Castille. 8 See Reply Br.
passim. Consequently, we summarily sustain the rejections of claims 25 and
37 in light of Barber and Castille.

DECISION
The Examiner's decision rejecting claims 13 and 21--44 is affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a). See 37 C.F.R.
§ 1.136(a)(l )(iv).

AFFIRMED

8

To the extent that Appellants implicitly intend to rely on the argument in
the Appeal Brief regarding claims 25 and 37, i.e., that modifying Barber to
incorporate a Ferris wheel changes the principal of operation of Barber
because Barber would no longer be "a portable amusement ride that
incorporates a multifunctional trailer" (Appeal Br. 36), the argument is not
persuasive for essentially the same reasons stated above for claims 22, 23,
34, and 35.
