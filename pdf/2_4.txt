OPINION
A.

Introduction4
The subject matter on appeal relates to "additive manufacturing

processes," which the '914 Specification defines as "a generic term used to
describe a process by which successive layers of a structure, device or
mechanism are formed, and in which in each layer components such as
electrical circuit components may be formed by a Direct Write method."
(Spec. 1, 11. 21-24.) "The term Direct Write is commonly used to describe a
range of technologies which allows the fabrication of two or threedimensional functional structures using processes that are compatible with
being carried out directly onto potentially large complex shapes."
(Id. at 11. 8-11.) The writing or printing materials, regardless of whether

they are powders, suspensions, vapors, or other materials, are referred to as
"inks." (Id. at 11. 27-31.) Once applied to a nascent three-dimensional
object, which is referred to as a "substrate," (id. at 2, 11. 4-7), the material is
fixed. (Id. at 1, 1. 32, to 2, 1. 2.) The commonly available printed materials
are said to have limited conductivity (id. at 2, 11. 24-27), and methods of
improving their conductivity, such as electroplating, are said to have limited
compatibility with direct writing methods because a bath of the metal
solution is needed. (Id. at 3, 1. 26, through 4, 1. 11.)

Appeal2015-002015
Application 13/126,914
The claimed method involves providing a partially conductive pattern
on a substrate surface, followed by plating the conductor using a bathless
process.
Claim 1 is representative and reads:
A method of forming a component of a conductive structure
on a substrate using an apparatus including
a surface treatment tool and
an electroplating tool,
compnsmg:

moving the surface treatment tool across a surface of the
substrate for applying a surface treatment to the substrate
to form a patterned area having at least some electrical
conductivity; and
moving the electroplating tool across the surface of the
substrate for electroplating the patterned area,
the electroplating tool having an electrode and an
electrolyte source for in situ supply of electrolyte,
by providing an anode current to the electrode,
the electroplating tool causing the patterned area in at
least a vicinity of the tool to function as a cathode,
and passing electrolyte between said patterned area
and said electrode, thereby to deposit conductive
material onto said patterned area,
wherein the steps of moving the surface treatment tool and
the electroplating tool are performed consecutively and in
a continuous progressive process across the surface of the
substrate.

and emphasis added.)

The Examiner maintains the following ground of rejection: 5
Claims 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9 stand rejected under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in view of the combined teachings of
Lowe, 6 Cleemput, 7 and Basol. 8
B.

Discussion
Findings of fact throughout this Opinion are supported by a

preponderance of the evidence of record.
Sidhu urges that the Examiner erred harmfully because "Lowe teaches
an electroplating station that focuses an electron beam onto the plane of a
web 27[ 9J, which moves at constant speed past the station." (Br. 4, 11. 9-10.)
Cleemput, as illustrated in the portion of Cleemput Fig. 1 reproduced
on the following page, teaches a screen printing process in which
"[a] squeegee 3 is moved across the surface of the screen 2 to push the paste
through the screen 2 and onto the surface of the substrate 23." (Id. at 11. 1314).

Application 13/126,914
{A portion of Cleemput Fig. 1 is reproduced below}

Thus, in Sidhu's view, the teachings of Lowe regarding a stationary beam
focused onto the surface of a moving substrate, of Cleemput regarding a
screen printing process in which a squeegee is moved above the surface of a
stationary substrate, and of Basol, in which a substrate is moved between
various stations for various processes, would not have resulted in the
claimed invention. (Id. at 6, 11. 9-30.)
This argument is not persuasive of harmful error. First, Sidhu appears
to have overlooked the Examiner's citation (FR 4) of Lowe, Figure 7,
reproduced below,

and the associated description at Lowe, page 4, paragraphs [0077]-[0082].
Lowe describes an embodiment in which tool 116 is moved in contact with
the surface of substrate 112, with electrodes 120 connected to the negative
pole of an electroplating circuit to deposit a layer of conductive metal along
tracks 114 (Lowe 4 [0082]). 10
Thus, both Lowe and Cleemput describe methods in which a tool is
moved across the substrate, as required by claim 1. Notably, Sidhu does not
dispute the Examiner's finding that the squeegee of Cleemput corresponds to
the surface treatment tool recited in claim 1.
As for Sidhu's criticism of the Examiner's reliance on Basol, we are
not persuaded that the artisan would have declined to combine the teachings
of Lowe with those of Cleemput merely because Basol transports the
substrate to different stations, rather than moving the stations past positions
on the substrate needing treatment. The Examiner provided a specific
analysis of the meaning of the terms "consecutive," and "continuous
progressive process" as they are recited in the final phrase of claim 1. (FR 5,
last para.) Sidhu has not addressed or criticized the Examiner's
interpretation in any substantive manner, and thus has not shown harmful
error in this aspect of the rejection. Put another way, Lowe does not
describe expressly how traces 114 are to be deposited on printed circuit
board 112 before they are dry electroplated. Cleemput describes a way of
depositing such traces. On the present record, Sidhu has not shown harmful
error in the Examiner's conclusion that it would have been obvious to apply
10

Sidhu belatedly recognizes this error in the Reply (Reply Brief
filed 2 December 2014). However, Sidhu does not address the Examiner's
findings regarding Lowe, Figure 7, reproduced at Ans. 3, 11. 1-16.
