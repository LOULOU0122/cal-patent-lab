DECISION ON APPEAL
This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. ยง 134 involving claims to methods
of determining IVF outcome, which have been rejected as directed to nonstatutory subject matter. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. ยง 6(b ).
We affirm.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
"Diagnosis and management of infertility is a prevalent health
concern in young adults." (Spec. 1.) One option for infertile couples is in

vitro fertilization, but it is associated with clinical complications. (Id.)
"Prediction of the chances for infertile women to give birth to a viable baby

Appeal2014-003571
Application 12/521,793
after IVF treatment is ... a major issue in the optimisation of the medical
response to increasing demands of infertile couples." (Id.) According to the
Specification, the "search for biomarkers that may predict pregnancy issues
after IVF, before initiation of treatment, remains a major challenge." (Id.)
Further according to the Specification, Appellants' invention "provides for
the first time a biomarker allowing the non-invasive evaluation and
prediction of IVF outcome." (Spec. 2.)
Claims 36, 39--41, 43, 46--48, 50-53, 57, and 64---67 are on appeal.
Claims 36, 43, 57, 64, and 66 are representative and read as follows:
36. A method for determining in vitro fertilization (IVF)
outcome comprising:
in vitro assaying for the level of soluble MHC class I
chain-related protein A (MICA) in a serum, plasma, or blood
sample from a subject;
comparing said level to a control;
predicting IVF outcome from said step of comparing, the
increased level of MICA relative to said matched control being
indicative of poor IVF outcome, increased implantation failure
rates, increased likelihood of IVF failure, and/or increased
likelihood of miscarriage; and
administering hormonal conditioning treatment to said
subject based on said step of predicting.
43. A method for selecting a subject for IVF comprising:
in vitro assaying for soluble MICA protein in a serum,
plasma, or blood sample;
selecting the subject for IVF having a level of MICA
indicative of a successful IVF probability, said level
corresponding to a level of soluble MICA protein in a matched
sample from a fertile control subject; and
transferring an embryo to said subject.
57. A method for determining the probability of pregnancy
complications in a subject comprising:

2

Appeal2014-003571
Application 12/521,793

in vitro assaying for soluble MICA protein in a serum,
plasma, or blood sample from a subject;
comparing said level to a control;
predicting a pregnancy complication from said step of
comparing, wherein an increased level of MICA relative to a
matched control is indicative of an increased probability of
pregnancy complications in the subject, wherein the pregnancy
complications are miscarriage, vascular pregnancy diseases
(VPD), preeclampsia (PE), severe preeclampsia, vascular
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), associated or not with
preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, gravidic steatosis, gravidic
nephropathy or intra-uterine foetal death (IUFD), pregnancy
diseases, or infertility associated with auto immune pathologies;
and
administering treatment of one or more pregnancy
complications to said subject based on said step of predicting.
64. A method for preparing to administer in vitro fertilization
(IVF) comprising:
in vitro assaying for the level of soluble MHC class I
chain-related protein A (MICA) in a serum, plasma, or blood
sample from a subject;
comparing said level to a matched control;
predicting a reduced likelihood of successful IVF
outcome from said step of comparing due to an increased level
of MICA relative to said matched control suggesting an
increased likelihood of poor IVF outcome, increased
implantation failure rates, increased likelihood of IVF failure,
and/or increased likelihood of miscarriage; and
administering hormonal conditioning treatment to said
subject based on said step of predicting.
66. A method for in vitro fertilization comprising:
in vitro assaying for the level of soluble MHC class I
chain-related protein A (MICA) in a serum, plasma, or blood
sample from a subject;
comparing said level to a matched control;
predicting a reduced likelihood of success of in vitro
fertilization from said step of comparing due to an increased
level of MICA relative to said matched control suggesting

greater risk of poor IVF outcome, implantation failure rates,
IVF failure, and/or miscarriage; and
administering in vitro fertilization to said subject based
on said step of predicting.
(Br. 12-16. ) 2 ' 3 The single ground of rejection by the Examiner that is before
us on review 1s:
Claims 36, 39--41, 43, 46--48, 50-53, 57, and 64--67 are rejected under
35 U.S.C. ยง 101 as directed to non-statutory subject matter.
DISCUSSION
The Examiner finds that "it is not in dispute that Appellant[ s] ha[ ve]
discovered a correlation between increased levels of sMICA [i.e., soluble
MHC class I chain-related protein A,] and a reduced likelihood of a woman
delivering a viable baby." (Ans. 6.) The Examiner notes that "the
specification teaches that soluble MICA levels in the serum greater than 2.45
ng/ml is indicative of higher implantation failure rates and greater than 3 .2
ng/ml prior to IVF cycles predicted a higher chance of miscarriage."
(Ans. 3.) The Examiner explains that, despite Appellants discovery, "the
claims recite a naturally existing relationship between the increased level of
soluble MICA in the serum, plasma or blood and the increased likelihood of

In their Response to the Restriction/Election Requirement filed October 10,
2011, Appellants elected miscarriage as the pregnancy complication. (Ans.
22.) Pending claims 54--56 and 60-63 stand withdrawn from consideration
as drawn to a non-elected invention. (Ans. 2.)

We recognize Appellants' January 29, 2014 Reply Brief, which addresses
an obviousness rejection of subject matter relating to "a silicon based
electrode in an electrochemical device." (See Reply Br. 1-3.) Neither an
obviousness rejection nor subject matter relating to a silicon based electrode
in an electrochemical device is before this panel. Therefore, we will not
further discuss Appellants' Reply Brief.

IVF failure" and only add "well-understood, routine, conventional activity
already engaged in by the scientific community [in the art of assisted
reproduction technology]." (Ans. 3--4.) The Examiner concludes, therefore,
that the claims do not include steps that are applications of a natural law that
represent patentable subject matter. (Ans. 6.) In particular, citing prior art,
the Examiner finds that "in vitro assay methods for measuring soluble MICA
[such as by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay] are well known in the
art," in addition to being a step that "merely informs a relevant audience
about a certain relationship that exists in nature." (Ans. 4.) As to the
additional steps of "administering hormonal conditioning treatment" (claims
36 and 64), "transferring an embryo" (claim 43), or "administering treatment
of one or more pregnancy complications" (claim 57), the Examiner notes
that the art of record provides evidence that these are routine in the art of in

vitro fertilization (Ans. 4, 9 (noting the generalized "hormonal conditioning
treatment" includes that which has been accomplished in the prior art routine
ovarian stimulation protocol), 18-20 (noting that embryo transfer was
routine in the field of assisted reproduction), 23 (noting that the generalized
"treatment" step includes that which has been accomplished in the prior art
as "treatment or care provided to patients who have undergone or who are
about to undergo a miscarriage"). As to claim 66, which requires
administering in vitro fertilization based on data gathering and a thought
process (making a prediction based on the comparison to measured levels of
sMICA and a matched control), the Examiner finds that the claim is simply
"the use of [the] correlation [between sMICA and IVF outcome] to
[determine whether to] undertake IVF treatment ... , [and the] steps
involved in IVF consist of well understood, routine, conventional activity

5

Appeal2014-003571
Application 12/521,793
already engaged in by the scientific community." (Ans. 27-31.) The
Examiner concludes that the pending claims all "recite[] a law of nature or
natural correlation, with additional steps that involve well-understood,
routine and conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the
field [and are] not patent-eligible." (Ans. 5, 14, 28, 33-34.)
We agree with the Examiner's conclusion that representative claims
36, 43, 57, 64, and 66 are directed to non-statutory subject matter consistent
with controlling caselaw. We "note that the Supreme Court instructs that
'[g]roundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself
satisfy theยง 101 inquiry."' Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc., 788
F.3d 1371, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting Ass 'nfor Molecular Pathology v.
Myriad Genetics, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2107, 2117 (2013) ). Thus, whether or not
"[t]he specification represents the first disclosure of a relationship between
the levels of sMICA in the blood, plasma, or serum and the outcome or
establishment of pregnancy" (Br. 4), is not determinative of whether the
representative claims are patent eligible.
The framework for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature or
natural phenomena from those that claim patent eligible applications of
those concepts involves the following two steps:
1. determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent
ineligible concept
2. if they are, consider the elements of each claim both individually
and "as an ordered combination" to determine whether additional
elements "transform the nature of the claim" into a patent eligible
application, i.e., search for an element or combination of elements
that is "sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to

6

Appeal2014-003571
Application 12/521,793
significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept]
itself."
Ariosa, 788 F.3d at 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting Mayo Collaborative
Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1289, 1294, 1298 (2012)).

Appellants do not dispute that the representative claims depend upon a
natural law or phenomena. (Br. 4 ("increased levels of sMICA correlate to a
reduced likelihood of a woman delivering a viable baby"). And we agree
with the Examiner's assessment that "[i]n the instant case, the claims recite a
naturally existing relationship between the increased level of soluble MICA
in the serum, plasma or blood and the increased likelihood of IVF failure."
(Ans. 3.) Thus, we move to the second step.
Appellants contend that "[t]he present claims recite specific, narrow,
and unconventional applications that involve steps such as administering
hormonal conditioning treatment, transferring an embryo, administering in
vitro fertilization, or treating a pregnancy complication ... [which] represent

concrete applications of any natural law falling under the claims and make
all claims patent eligible under 35 U.S.C. ยง 101." (Br. 4.) We disagree that
the recited steps transform the claims into patent eligible subject matter.
The representative patent claims 36, 43, 57, 64, and 66 focus on a
newly discovered fact about human biology (sMICA levels and the
relationship to in vitro fertilization outcome), involve no creation or
alteration of natural products, and do not purport to identify novel detection
techniques. And, as explained by the Examiner, these claims do not involve
novel treatment steps or in vitro fertilization steps. (Ans. 4, 9 (noting the
generalized "hormonal conditioning treatment" includes that which has been
accomplished in the prior art routine ovarian stimulation protocol), 18-20

7

Appeal2014-003571
Application 12/521,793
(noting that embryo transfer was routine in the field of assisted
reproduction), 23 (noting that the generalized "treatment" step includes that
which has been accomplished in the prior art as "treatment or care provided
to patients who have undergone or who are about to undergo a
miscarriage"), 30-31 (noting that in vitro assaying and administering IVF
was known in the art and citing prior art to show same). Indeed, Appellants
do not dispute that the additional steps of "administering hormonal
conditioning treatment" (claims 36 and 64 ), "transferring an embryo" (claim
43), "administering treatment of one or more pregnancy complications"
(claim 57), or administering IVF (claim 66) were conventional and routine
in assisted reproductive technology and IVF at the time the claimed
inventions were made.
Appellants' argument that the field of invention is sMICA and the
specific treatments administered by the claims are unconventional in that
field is unpersuasive. (Br. 3--4, 6, 8, 9.) As the Examiner correctly found,
"[t]he field of the invention is not limited to the 'sMICA art' (studies
involving MHC class I chain-related protein A) ... [but rather fall] more
broadly within the field of assisted reproduction technology and in vitro
fertilization." (Ans. 13.) In particular, as the Examiner noted, "instant
claims 36 and 64 are drawn to methods for determining IVF outcome and
preparing to administer IVF respectively" (Ans. 14); claim 43 involves the
routine act of embryo transfer that was routinely carried out "in the art of
assisted reproduction at the time of the invention" (Ans. 18-19); under the
"broadest reasonable interpretation of [claim 57] when read in light of the
specification and from the view of one of ordinary skill in the art, [that
claim] would encompass any routine treatment or care provided to patients

8

Appeal2014-003571
Application 12/521,793
[undergoing IVF] who have undergone or who are about to undergo a
miscarriage" (Ans. 24--25); and claim 66 recites "administering IVF to a
subject based on the prediction [of the likelihood of establishing pregnancy
based on the step of comparing sMICA levels to a matched control]" (Ans.
26).
As was the case in Mayo and Ariosa, the method claims at issue here
amount to "nothing significantly more than an instruction to doctors to apply
the applicable laws when treating their patients" using "conventional steps,
specified at a high level of generality." Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1298, 1300;
Ariosa, 788 F.3d at 1377-78. Such claims are patent ineligible. Mayo, 132
S. Ct. at 1300; Ariosa, 788 F.3d at 1378.
Appellants argue that the varied methods recited indicate that none
individually preempts all uses of the natural phenomena, thus avoiding the
"primary concern of the Supreme Court in Mayo." (Br. 10.) This argument
also does not persuade us that the representative claims are patent eligible.
"While preemption may signal patent ineligible subject matter, the absence
of complete preemption does not demonstrate patent eligibility." Ariosa,
788 F.3d at 1379. "Where a patent's claims are deemed only to disclose
patent ineligible subject matter under the Mayo framework, as they are in
this case, preemption concerns are fully addressed and made moot." Id.
For the reasons discussed, Appellants do not persuade us that the
Examiner erred in rejecting claims 36, 43, 57, 64, and 66 as directed to nonstatutory subject matter. Claims 39--41, 46--48, 50-53, 65, and 67 have not
been argued separately and therefore fall with claims 36, 43, 57, 64, and 66.
