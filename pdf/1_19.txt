WIEDER, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON APPEAL
This is a decision on appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from the
Examiner's rejection of claims 1, 3-5, 7-9, 11-13, 15, 16, and 18-20. We
have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b ).
We REVERSE.

1

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharma GmbH & Co. KG. (Appeal Br. 2.)

Appeal2015-000046
Application 11/560,267
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Appellants' claimed "invention relates to a powder inhaler having at
least one specially sharpened needle for the precise piercing or cutting open
of capsules." (Spec. 1.)
Claims 1, 9, and 16 are the independent claims on appeal. Claim 1 is
illustrative and is reproduced below (emphasis added):
1.
An inhaler for delivering a powdered medicament from a
capsule, comprising: at least one needle having a diameter of

1.00-2.00 mm, a solid substantially circular cross-section about
a central longitudinal axis, and a triangular point defined by
three substantially equally shaped bevels meeting at a tip located
on the central longitudinal axis, wherein the at least one needle
operates to perforate or cut open the capsule by piercing the
capsule and withdrawing therefrom to produce an aperture
through which to release the powdered medicament.

REJECTIONS
Claims 1, 4, 5, 16, and 19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in
view ofOhki (US 5,715,811, iss. Feb. 10, 1998) and Haroldsen
(EP 582,276 Al, pub. Feb. 9, 1994).
Claims 3 and 18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in view of
Ohki, Haroldsen, and Koss (US 4,541,427, iss. Sept. 17, 1985).
Claims 7, 8, and 20 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in view of
Ohki, Haroldsen, and Hochrainer (US 2001/0008637 Al, pub.
July 19, 2001.)
Claims 9, 12, and 13 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in view of
Hochrainer (US 5,947,118, iss. Sept. 7, 1999), Ohki, Haroldsen, and
Altermatt (US 5,263,475, iss. Nov. 23, 1993.)

Appeal2015-000046
Application 11/560,267
Claim 11 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in view of
Hochrainer '118, Ohki, Haroldsen, Altermatt, and Koss.
Claim 15 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in view of
Hochrainer '118, Ohki, Haroldsen, Altermatt, and Hochrainer '63 7.

ANALYSIS
With regard to claim 1, the Examiner finds that
Ohki is silent as to the needle having a diameter of 1.00-2.00 mm
and the point being defined by three equally shaped bevels.
However, Haroldsen teaches a needle that includes a diameter of
1.00-2.00 mm (see col. 3 ln. 25) and a triangular point defined
by three equally shaped bevels (see Fig. 17C & 18A).
(Final Action 2-3.)
Appellants argue that
Haroldsen (EP 582276) is very specific that the shaft of the
needle should be nonround, and specifies all types of non-round
cross-sections. (See, col. 1, lines 39--49; col. 2, lines 24--37;
col. 3, lines 13-15, 29--48.) The cross-section of the needle of
FIG. 17C, which the Examiner cites, is triangular and non-round.
(See, col. 5, lines 3---6.)
(Appeal Br. 7.) Appellants further argue that "the needle of Haroldsen
(EP 582276) does not have a 'diameter' as the Examiner asserts. Indeed, the
evidence on record is irrefutable in that the needle of Haroldsen (EP 582276)
must be formed of non-round stock to meet its objective." (Id. at 8.)
The Examiner answers that Ohki "discloses a substantially circular
cross-sectional needle 16" and that
[t]he modification to the Ohki needle was to only modify the tip
of Ohki to be the three triangular bevel configuration taught by
Haroldsen (Fig 17C) as well as to have the size range of 1.00-

2.00 mm taught by Haroldsen (col. 3 ln. 25) in order to provide
a well-known needle shape configuration.
(Answer 11.)
With regard to the Examiner's finding that "Haroldsen teaches a
needle that includes a diameter of 1.00-2.00 mm" (Final Action 3),
Haroldsen does not refer to a "diameter" but rather states that "[i]n its
broadest dimension, the width of the non-round wire may range from about
0.001 to about 0.075 inches." (Haroldsen, col. 3, 11. 23-25.) Haroldsen
further discloses that "[t]he term 'non-round' wire is intended to embrace
any wire that in cross-section has a shape other than round." (Id. at col. 3,
11. 29-31.) In short, Haroldsen discloses a needle having a non-round wire
with a broadest width "from about 0.001 to about 0.075 inches." (See id. at
col. 3, 11. 23-25.)
With regard to a triangular point, Haroldsen discloses that "[i]n a
particularly useful embodiment of this invention, the cross-sectional shape
of the point section formed by tapering is essentially the same as the crosssectional shape of the non-round wire, over a substantial portion of the point
section." (Haroldsen, col. 4, 11. 51-55; see also Appeal Br. 7.) In other
words, the triangular point disclosed in Haroldsen is formed, not by tapering
a round wire to a triangular point, but by tapering a triangular wire to a
triangular point. (Id. at col. 5, 11. 21-24, Figs. 17C, 18A.) The Examiner
does not "identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary
skill in the relevant field to combine the elements" of Ohki and Haroldsen to
taper a round wire to a triangular point. See KSR Int 'l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc.,
550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007).

Appeal2015-000046
Application 11/560,267
Therefore, we are persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claim 1. Independent claims 9 and 16 contain similar language and for
similar reasons, we are persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting
claims 9 and 16, and dependent claims 3-5, 7, 8, 11-13, 15, and 18-20.

DECISION
The Examiner's rejections of claims 1, 3-5, 7-9, 11-13, 15, 16, and
18-20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) are reversed.

REVERSED
