DISCUSSION
Having considered the evidence on this appeal record in light of the
respective positions advanced by the Examiner and Appellants, we do not sustain
the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 9-27 under 35 U.S.C. §103(a)
substantially for the reasons set forth at pages 4 through 12 of the Appeal Brief and
pages 3 and 4 of the Reply Brief filed July 10, 2013 ("Reply Br."). We add the
following primarily for emphasis.
Figure lB of Zanzucchi relied upon by the Examiner is reproduced below:

FIG. 18

5

Appeal2013-009068
Application 12/924,351
Figure 1B illustrates a micro laboratory disc 14 having a large number of modules
48 in "parallel" connected to well 46 to perform a large number of tests, with each
module defining loading channel 34 and/or 50 (identified by the Examiner as a
chamber at page 3 of the Final Action) and a plurality of wells 36, 40, 42, and 44
connected by channel 38. See, e.g., Zanzucchi, col. 4, 11. 21-30 and 55-62 and col.
5, 11. 3-6. One or more capillary tubes 32 containing a sample (not shown in
Figure lB) is loaded into loading channel 34 or into loading channel 50 for vertical
insertion into the loading channel 34. See, e.g., Zanzucchi, col. 4, 11. 15-27. "As
the sample loading tube 32 is inserted into the loading channel 34, a sealant, which
can be adhered to the edge of the capillary sample tube 32 or to the loading
channel 34, seals the capillary tube 32 to the channel 34." Zanzucchi, col. 5, 1. 65col. 6, 1. 2.
The sample is then subsequently treated in a series of wells 36, 40, 42, and
44, with first well 36 being used for separating or filtering the sample from the
loading channel 34 and second well 40 being used for amplifying the separated or
filtered sample from first well 36 via using the conventional PCR method. See,

e.g., Zanzucchi, col. 4, 11. 35--44. Because a significant vapor pressure may
develop in first well 36, valves 62 and 63 (not shown in Figure lB) are used to
prevent "a back pressure in both directions [of first well 36]-back toward the
sample loading channel 34 and forward to the succeeding second well 40."
Zanzucchi, col. 9, 11. 34-54.
Once all of the wells have been prepared and loaded, "a glass cover plate 63
[not shown in Figure lB] is affixed to the microlaboratory disc 14 ... to complete
a capillary structure for the connecting channel 3 8 [(identified by the Examiner as
a conduit at page 3 of the Final Action)] and to ensure that fluids in the well do not
evaporate." Zanzucchi, col. 8, 11. 35-39. "The cover plate 63 can be made of the

6

Appeal2013-009068
Application 12/924,351
same or different material as the microlaboratory disc, but the thermal coefficient
of expansion of the cover plate 63 and the material used to make the
microlaboratory disc 14 must be similar." Zanzucchi, col. 8, 11. 38--43. "The
sealing temperature required to seal the cover plate 63 to the disc 14 must also be
below the flow temperature of the disk material to prevent distortion of the etched
channels and wells." Zanzucchi, col. 8, 11. 42--46.
The Examiner acknowledges that Zanzucchi does not disclose, inter alia, "a
cover connected to the test device moveable from a first position covering the first
chamber to a second position so as to enable a user to supply the sample into the
first chamber directly" as recited in claims 9 and 21. 3 Final Act. 4. To account for

3

The Examiner also acknowledges that Zanzucchi does not indicate that its
"second chamber [(second well 40)] has an external configuration sized and shaped
so as to place the second chamber into thermal contact with controlled heating
elements provided in the analytical instrument when the test device
[(microlaboratory disc 14)] is inserted into the instrument" as recited in claim 9
because it describes using heating elements ,~1ithin the test device to conduct
amplification in second well 40. Final Act. 3. However, the Examiner finds, and
Appellants do not dispute, that "Anderson discloses a microfluidic amplification
test device in which at least one first chamber (Figure 3 :206) [configured to
separate a sample] is in communication with a second chamber (Figure 3 :210)
configured to conduct PCR. Paragraphs [0166]-[0167] [of Anderson] teach that
the test device itself may include a heating element, or, alternatively, ... contact
heating elements provided within an associated analytical instrument ('the
amplification chamber will incorporate a controllable heater disposed within or
adjacent to the amplification chamber')." Compare Final Act. 3--4 with App. Br.
8-9; see also Anderson iJiJ164-166. Stated differently, there is no dispute that a
heating element can be provided in the associated analytical instrument
(Zanzucchi's station 16 not shown in Figure lB) for heating second well 40
(configured for PCR amplification) of the micro laboratory disc taught by
Zanzucchi per the teachings of Anderson. Id. Implicit in this suggestion in the
applied prior art is that second well 40 of the micro laboratory disc taught by
Zanzucchi must also be designed or shaped to be fitted into and heated by
Zanzucchi's station (analytical instrument) having such heating element. Thus,
7

Appeal2013-009068
Application 12/924,351
this missing feature in the microlaboratory disc taught by Zanzucchi, the Examiner
relies upon the disclosure of Gerdes. Final Act. 4-5. Figure 1 of Gerdes relied
upon by the Examiner is reproduced below:

In Gerdes' Figure 1, "an extraction, amplification and detection device consists of
a first hollow elongated cylinder 1 having one closed end and an integrally-molded
cover 3 hinged to the opposing, open end and a second hollow elongated cylinder 2
[having an aperture 13 not shown] that is positioned contiguously inside the first
cylinder 1 and capable of relative rotation." Gerdes, col. 6, 11. 36--42; see also
Final Act. 4-5. "The first cylinder 1 further consists of 2 chambers: a reservoir 16
and a detection chamber 20, said detection chamber further consisting of a pad 9
and a strip 10." Gerdes, col. 6, 11. 45-47. "When sample is introduced into the
device, nucleic acid extraction and amplification takes place in the second cylinder
2 .... " Id. at col. 6, 11. 58-60; see also Final Act. 4-5. The second cylinder 2 is
rotated "relative to the first cylinder l" to lock into positions A, B, and C, with
positions B and C allowing the amplified sample from the second cylinder 2 to

Appellants' argument directed to the external configuration and the shape of a
second well for conducting PCR amplification does not convince us of harmful
error in the Examiner's §103(a) rejections.

Appeal2013-009068
Application 12/924,351
flow into the reservoir 16 and the detection chamber 20, respectively. Gerdes, col.
6, 1. 64-col. 7, 1. 12; see also Final Act. 4-5.
Based on Figure lB of Zanzucchi and Figure 1 of Gerdes discussed supra,
the Examiner concludes that "[a]t the time of the invention, it would have been
obvious to provide the opening to the first chamber 50 of Zanzucchi with a cover
component capable of being moved from a first position to a second position in
order to enable the addition of fluid." Final Act. 5.
However, on this record, the Examiner has not demonstrated that Gerdes'
hinged cap or cover suitable for a rotating cylinder (test tube) device would be
useful for the microlaboratory disc taught by Zanzucchi. As correctly stated by
Appellants, "Zanzucchi's cover 63 (Fig. 5B) must remain fixed and sealed to the
top of the device in order to define a capillary channel 3 8 ... and allow fluid to
move along the channels from the sample introduction well 50 to the remaining
wells ... and to prevent the fluids pre-loaded into the wells from evaporating after
manufacture." App. Br. 9-10. In particular, Zanzucchi discloses that:
When all of the wells have been prepared and loaded, a glass cover
plate 63 is affixed to the microlaboratory disc 14, as shown in FIG.
5B, to complete a capillary structure for the connecting channel 3 8
and to ensure that fluids in the wells do not evaporate[.] The cover
plate 63 can be made of the same or different material as the
micro laboratory disc, but the thermal coefficient of expansion of the
cover plate 63 and the material used to make the microlaboratory disc
14 must be similar. The sealing temperature required to seal the cover
plate 63 to the disc 14 must also be below the flow temperature of the
disk material to prevent distortion of the etched channels and wells.
The use of electric fields to seal the cover plate to the disk is suitable
because sealing will take place at a lower temperature than the flow
temperature, e.g., about 700° C. or less, which is well below the flow
temperature of silicon, about l 400°C., or of Coming 7059 glass,
(about 844° C.), available from Coming Glass Co., for example.
[Zanzucchi, col. 8 lines 3 5-51.]

9

Appeal2013-009068
Application 12/924,351

Zanzucchi also discloses that"[ a]s the sample loading [capillary] tube 32 is
inserted into the loading channel 34, a sealant, which can be adhered to the edge of
the capillary sample tube 32 or to the loading channel 34, seals the capillary tube
32 to the channel 34." Zanzucchi, col. 5, 1. 65-col. 6, 1. 2; see also Reply Br. 3.
Zanzucchi further teaches using an alternate, but similar, configuration involving
the capillary tube 32 inserted into the loading channel 50. Zanzucchi, col. 4, 11. 1527 and col. 6, 11. 2-8; see also Reply Br. 3. In other words, Zanzucchi teaches
using both the cover 63 and the capillary tube 32 containing a sample to seal the
surface of its micro laboratory disc to form capillary channels connecting sealed
chambers to prevent evaporation of the sample during the use of the
microlaboratory disc in an analytical device (station 16) as indicated supra. Such
cover and capillary tube also allow Zanzucchi's microlaboratory disc to have up to
1500 parallel modules for conducting broad DNA screening in parallel, i.e.,
conducting a large array of parallel tests at the same time, without evaporating
samples, during their use in the analytical device. Zanzucchi, col. 5, 11. 3-12.
On this record, the Examiner does not identify any prior art teaching or
evidence that would have indicated that Gerdes' hinged cap or cover would be
useful for the purposes taught by Zanzucchi, i.e., suitable for forming capillary
channels connecting sealed chambers in a manner that would allow Zanzucchi' s
microlaboratory disc to have up to 1500 parallel modules useful for conducting a
large array of parallel tests, without causing any evaporation of the sample, in a
particular analytical device. Final Act. 3-1 O; Ans. 2-6. Hence, we concur with
Appellants that a preponderance of the evidence does not support the Examiner's
determination that the applied prior art would have rendered the subject matter

10

Appeal2013-009068
Application 12/924,351
recited in claims 9-27 obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art within the
meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
ORDER
In view of the foregoing, the decision of the Examiner to reject claims 9-27
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) is REVERSED.
