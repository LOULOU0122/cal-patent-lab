DECISION ON APPEAL 2

1

Appellants identify the real party in interest as Dow Global Technologies,
LLC. Appeal Br. 3.

In our opinion below, we reference the Specification filed July 8, 2009
(Spec.), the Appeal Brief filed February 13, 2014 (Appeal Br.), the
Examiner's Answer mailed May 21, 2014 (Ans.), and the Reply Brief filed
July 21, 2014 (Reply Br.).

Appeal2014-008180
Application 12/499,667
STATEMENT OF CASE
Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) the Examiner's decision
to reject claims 1-5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17-20 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) as
anticipated by Pepper. 3 We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We REVERSE.
The claims are directed to a carpet or carpet tile. Claim 1 is
illustrative:
1. A carpet or carpet tile comprising

a primary backing material having a face and a back side,
a plurality of fibers attached to the primary backing material
and extending from the face of the primary backing material
and exposed at the back side of the primary backing material,
an optional precoat,
an adhesive backing material,
an optional dimensional stability layer,
an optional cap coat material, and
an optional secondary backing material adjacent to the
dimensional stability layer or adhesive backing material,
wherein at least one of the plurality of fibers, the primary
backing material, the optional precoat layer, the adhesive
backing material, the optional dimensional stability layer, or the
optional secondary backing material comprises at least one non3

Pepper et al., US 2010/0272946 Al, pub. Oct. 28, 2010. Appellants have
made a statement that Pepper was commonly owned by Dow Global
Technologies, Inc. at the time the invention in the current application (Serial
No. 12/499,667) was made. Appellants' After-Final Response filed Nov. 6,
2013 at 6-7. Thus, although Pepper qualifies as prior art for use in a
rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e), it does not qualify as prior art under 35
U.S.C. § 103. See 35 U.S.C. § 103(c) (2006); MPEP § 706(1) (8th ed., rev. 7,
July 2008).

chlorinated, non-polyvinyl butyral thermoplastic polymer or
composition having a growth tension of 40C of less than about
25 psi and a residual stress at 25% strain of less than about 63%
wherein the at least one non-chlorinated, non-polyvinyl
butyral thermoplastic polymer or composition is an olefin block
copolymer (OBC); and,
wherein the cap coat material or the adhesive backing
material further comprises

24 wt% of the OBC,
(a) at least one filler in an amount of 60% by weight
based on the total weight of the material, wherein the filler is
selected from the group consisting of coal fly ash, ATH,
CaC03, talc, recycled glass, magnesium hydroxide, ground up
tires, and ground up carpet,
(b) 4 wt% of at least one maleic anhydride grafted high
density polyethylene (MAH-g-HDPE),
(c) 1 wt% of at least one oil,
(d) optionally, a color additive such as carbon black, and
(e) 11 wt% of at least one tackifier.
Appeal Br. 15.

OPINION
Claim 1 requires the carpet or carpet tile include a primary backing
material, a plurality of fibers, and an adhesive backing material. The carpet
or carpet tile may also contain a number of other optional materials and
layers. At least one of the named components must comprise "at least one
non-chlorinated, non-polyvinyl butyral thermoplastic polymer or
composition having a growth tension of 40C of less than about 25 psi and a
3

Appeal2014-008180

residual stress at 25% strain of less than about 63%." Claim 1. The claim
then further narrows this polymer or composition to an olefin block
copolymer (OBC). Id. This is, for instance, an ethylene block interpolymer
with particular properties. Spec. 2-3. The Specification discloses that the
fibers, primary backing, adhesive backing and optional secondary backing
can all comprise a polyolefin multi-block polymer (OBC), but that the olefin
monomer chemistry of the adhesive backing differs from that of the fibers
and the primary backing. Spec. 3:7-11; see also Spec. 13:15-29.
Claim 1 further recites that the cap coat material or the adhesive
backing material further comprises "24 wt% of the OBC." The claim then
lists other ingredients (a) through (e). Although it is not clear from the
claim, "24 wt% of the OBC" is the weight percent of OBC in the
composition also containing components (a) through (e). This becomes
clear upon a reading of the Specification. The only mention in the
Specification of 24 wt% OBC refers to a formulation used to determine
growth tension at 40 °C. Specifically, the Specification describes an
example composition including 24 wt% OBC (ethylene/1-octene multiblock
copolymer), 4 wt% of a maleic anhydride grafted ethylene polymer, 60 wt%
coal ash, 1 wt% oil, and about 11 wt% tackifier, i.e., the components
required by the (a) through (e) list of claim 1. Spec. 24: 14--21.
Thus, claim 1 requires a cap coat material or adhesive backing
material that comprises 24 wt% OBC along with 60 wt% filler, 4 wt%
maleic anhydride grafted high density polyethylene, 1 wt% oil, and 11 wt%
tackifier.
To support a finding of anticipation, the Examiner points to a
disclosure in Pepper of a range of about 10-75 wt% OBC in paragraph 154

Appeal2014-008180
Application 12/499,667
and Examples 1-3 of paragraph 220, which have 39 wt%, 31.2 wt%, and
23.2 wt% OBC, respectively. Ans. 4.
In order to anticipate, a reference must identify something falling
within the claimed subject matter with sufficient specificity to constitute a
description thereof within the purview of§ 102. In re Schaumann, 572 F.2d
312, 317, (CCPA 1978). "[D]ifferences between the prior art reference and a
claimed invention, however slight, invoke the question of obviousness, not
anticipation." Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 F.3d 1359, 1371
(Fed. Cir. 2008).
Looking first at the examples cited by the Examiner, we agree with
Appellants that none of Examples 1-3 describe a composition having all the
components required by claim 1. This is illustrated well by Appellants'
Table A. Appeal Br. 9. The closest example is Example 3, but this example
has 23.2 wt% OBC instead of24 wt% and 5.8 wt% high pressure low
density ethylene polymer, instead of 4 wt% maleic anhydride grafted high
density polyethylene (MAH-g-HDPE), and 10 wt% tackifier instead of 11
wt%. Pepper i-f 220. This is not the same composition as that of claim 1.
We also agree with Appellants that paragraph 154 does not support
the finding of anticipation. Reply Br. 4. Paragraph 154 is directed to an
aqueous pre-coat material applied either as a final backing or before an
adhesive backing material is extruded. Pepper i-f 153. Pepper explains that
the particles in the dispersion of the aqueous pre-coating can be made from
OBC. Id. The 10-75 wt% range cited by the Examiner is for the OBC
particles of the pre-coat aqueous dispersion. Pepper i-f 154. The aqueous
pre-coat described by Pepper is not the same as the adhesive backing

material. Nor is there is description of a composition containing 24 wt%
OBC with the filler, MAH-g-HDPE, oil, and tackifier required by claim 1.

CONCLUSION
We do not sustain the Examiner's rejection.

DECISION
The Examiner's decision is reversed.

REVERSED
