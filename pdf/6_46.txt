FINDINGS OF FACT
The Examiner's findings of fact are set forth in the Final Action

Application 13/513,640
1. Pellico, Example 2 is reproduced below.
Example 2
Pellico Example 2 shows an enzymatic dentrifice containing
commercial glucose as the source of Beta-D-glucose. The
commerical [sic] glucose in this example is a dry, free-flowing
powder that contains approximately 95% of the Alpha anomer
and approximately 5% of the Beta anomer and which is
distributed by Com Products Corporation under the designation
Cerelose 2502 USP. Syloid 244FP is the designation for a food
grade amorphous silica thickener. Cocoamidopropyl betaine is
an amphoteric surfactant.

PRINCIPLES OF LAW
"The combination of familiar elements according to known
methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield
predictable results." KSR Int'! Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416
(2007).
"[W]hen unexpected results are used as evidence of
nonobviousness, the results must be shown to be unexpected
compared with the closest prior art." In re Baxter-Travenol Labs.,
952 F.2d 388, 392 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

_,_Rejection 1 Obviousness
=

We agree with the Examiner's fact finding, statement of the
rejection, and responses to Appellants' arguments as set forth in the
Answer. We find that the Examiner has provided evidence to support
a prima facie case of obviousness. We provide the following
additional comment to the Examiner's argument set forth in the Final
Action and Answer.
As to claim 1 interpretation, we agree with the Examiner that
the term "non-aqueous" has not been defined by
appellant [in the Specification] and is distinct from
"anhydrous", which is completely water-free. Note that the
instant disclosure teaches away from "anhydrous" formulations
insofar as it states, "A drawback to the use of such anhydrous
4

Appeal2015-003389
Application I3/5I3,640
products is that, due to the absence of water, application of the
oral composition tends to desiccate oral tissues, which lead to
irritation and tissue damage" (Specification p. I, para. [0003]).
Accordingly, the "non-aqueous" formulations of the instant
invention are not completely free of water. In other words,
there is a tolerance for small amounts of water. For instance,
Example IE of Pellico (see col. 6), which comprises less that
I% water, would reasonably suffice as "non-aqueous".
Ans. 6. Appellants do not take issue with or address the Examiner's
claim interpretation in the Brief. Arguments not made are waived.
The Examiner argues that Pellico teaches or suggests each
element claimed. Ans. 3. Pellico, Example 2 (FF I) illustrates an
enzymatic dentrifice containing commercial glucose as the source of
Beta-D-glucose. The composition of Example 2 also contains glucose
oxidase, and does not contain water, and is therefore non-aqueous.
Example 2, however, does not disclose the claimed polymer,
polyethylene glycol. The Examiner also relies, alternatively, on
Pellico, Example IE set forth above (FF2). Pellico, Example IE also
discloses a (lOOg) dental composition with Beta-D-glucose, glucose
oxidase, polyethylene glycol, as claimed, and also 0.975(g) of water.
Appellants contend that, "[a]lthough Pellico discloses that water
should be at a relatively low concentration level, nowhere in Pellico is there
a teaching or suggestion that the entire composition must be non-aqueous".
Br. 3.
The Examiner interprets the Pellico disclosure of "not more
than about IO wt.% of water" (Col. 4, 11. 45-47) to include water
amounts of less than about I 0% water, including 0% and less than I%

5

Appeal2015-003389
Application 13/513,640
(see Pellico at Example 1 A-IE and Example 2). Ans. 5. We find that

Pellico's, Example 2, would support the Examiner's interpretation that
0% water is encompassed by Pellico' s statement that its dentifrice
contain "less than about 10% water." In conjunction with the
Examiner's interpretation of the language of claim 1 that small
amounts of water are included in the meaning of the term "nonaqueous" in claim 1, we find claim 1 obvious in view of Pellico,
Example IE, and in view of Pellico's additional disclosure suggesting
that its dental compositions may include water amounts of less than
about 10%, including compositions containing 0% water.
Appellants further argue that they have presented evidence of
secondary considerations by showing "surprising evidence of higher
peroxide formation when using their single phase composition as
opposed to the conventional dual tube aqueous formulation." Br. 3-4.
Ho\'l1ever, \'l.;e agree \'l1ith the Examiner that, "the issue \'l1ith regard to

dual tube aqueous formulations would not apply to the formulations of
Pellico since they are single phase formulations comprising low to 0%
water (again see Pellico at Example 1 A-IE and Example 2)." Ans. 6.
Appellants have not distinguished the disclosure of Pellico with
appropriate evidence or compared the claimed invention with the
closest prior art, in this case the Pellico disclosure.
Rejection 1 is affirmed for the reasons of record.

Rejections 2 and 3

Rejections 2 and 3 tum on the same issue as rejection 1, that is,
whether Pellico teaches a non-aqueous composition. Appellants argue
6

Appeal2015-003389
Application 13/513,640
that Rejections 2 and 3 are allowable for the reasons argued with
respect to Rejection 1. Br. 4, 5. Having found that Pellico teaches a
non-aqueous composition, Rejections 2 and 3 are also affirmed for the
reasons of record.

CONCLUSION OF LAW
The cited references support the Examiner's obviousness
rejections, which are affirmed for the reasons of record. All pending,
rejected claims fall with claim 1. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection
with this appeal may be extended under 3 7 C.F .R. § 1.13 6( a). See 3 7
C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
