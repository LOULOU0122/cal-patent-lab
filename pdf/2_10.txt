DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Matthias Huisinga et al. (Appellants) seek our review under 35 U.S.C.
§ 134 of the Examiner's final rejection of claims 1, 7, and 9 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b) as anticipated by Sanchez-Martinez (US 2007/0212923 Al, pub.

Sept. 13, 2007); and claims 2-6 and 8 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 (a) as
unpatentable over Sanchez-Martinez. 2 We have jurisdiction under 35
U.S.C. § 6(b).

According to Appellants, the real party in interest is Braun GmbH. Appeal

We REVERSE.
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claim 1, the sole independent claim, is reproduced below and
illustrates the claimed subject matter, with disputed limitations emphasized.
1. An epilation head for an epilation device particularly
for plucking hair from human skin having a rotating cylinder and
rotating around a rotational axis, the rotating cylinder having a
number of plucking units for grasping and plucking out hair and
having a skin oriented surface, wherein each plucking unit
comprises a movable clamping unit, a stationary clamping unit,
wherein the movable clamping unit and the stationary clamping
unit form a closable plucking gap and wherein in that the
movable clamping units have a skin contacting surface and the

total area of the skin contacting surfaces of the movable
clamping units is greater than about 5% of the area of the skin
oriented surface.
ANALYSIS

Anticipation of Claims 1, 7, and 9 by Sanchez-Martinez
We are persuaded by Appellants' arguments that the Examiner fails to
establish anticipation in rejecting claims 1, 7, and 9 over Sanchez-Martinez.

See Appeal Br. 2.
The Examiner finds Sanchez-Martinez anticipates claim 1 by
disclosing an epilation head for an epilation device having movable

matters. See In re Schneider, 481F.2d1350, 1356-57 (CCPA 1973); In re
Mindick, 371 F.2d 892, 894 (CCPA 1967); see also MPEP § 1002.02(c) and
§ 1201. Thus, the relief sought by Appellants should be presented by a
petition to the Commissioner under 37 C.F.R. § 1.181 instead of by appeal
to this Board. Accordingly, we do not further consider this issue.

Appeal2014-005476
Application 13/315,736
clamping units where, inter alia, "the total area of the skin contacting
surfaces of the movable clamping units is greater than about 5% of the area
of the skin oriented surface." Final Act. 3 (citing Sanchez-Martinez, Figs. 1,
2 (illustrating an epilation head having a skin oriented surface including the
skin contacting surface of movable clamping unit 10)).
Appellants take issue with the analysis and conclusions presented in
the Final Action, explaining that Sanchez-Martinez "is silent with regard to
a skin oriented surface and is further silent with regard to skin contacting
surface or the ratio of the absent skin contacting surfaces from the
unmentioned skin oriented surface," and does not "inherently include the
otherwise undisclosed elements." Appeal Br. 2. We agree. Appellants
conclude that "[t]he absence of direct or inherent disclosure of the elements
in the reference render the reference incapable of supporting an anticipation
rejection under 35 USC§ 102." Id.
The Examiner does not respond to Appellants' contentions as set forth
in the Appeal Brief, but merely reproduces the Final Action verbatim. See
Ans. 2-6. Thus the Examiner has provided no basis for disputing
Appellants' explanation of the short-comings of Sanchez-Martinez.
[U]nless a reference discloses within the four comers of the
document not only all of the limitations claimed but also all of
the limitations arranged or combined in the same way as recited
in the claim, it cannot be said to prove prior invention of the thing
claimed and, thus, cannot anticipate under 35 U.S.C. § 102.
Net MoneyIN, Inc., v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 F.3d 1359, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

For the foregoing reasons, we do not sustain the Examiner's decision
rejecting claims 1, 7, and 9 as anticipated by Sanchez-Martinez.

Appeal2014-005476
Application 13/315,736
Obviousness of Claims 2-6 and 8 over Sanchez-Martinez
Regarding dependent claims 2-6, and 8, the Examiner's rejection is
based on the same unsupported findings discussed above with respect to the
disclosure of Sanchez-Martinez. See Final Act. 4-5; repeated verbatim at
Ans. 4-5. Accordingly, for similar reasons as discussed above for claim 1,
we do not sustain the Examiner's decisions rejecting claims 2-6, and 8 over
Sanchez-Martinez

DECISION
The Examiner's prior-art rejections are reversed.

REVERSED
