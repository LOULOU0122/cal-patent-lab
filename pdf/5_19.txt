BACKGROUND
The subject matter involved in this appeal relates to a system for
generating hydrogen gas. Spec. 1. Claims 1 and 15-the only independent
claims-illustrate the subject matter on appeal and are reproduced from the
Claims Appendix of the Appeal Brief as follows:
1.
A system for producing hydrogen gas used in powering
an internal combustion engine of a vehicle, said system
compnsmg:
a hydrogen reactor having a chamber and a set of
electrode plates arranged in a predetermined stacked array
within said chamber, said electrode plates including a plurality
of positively charged and negatively charged plates disposed in
a predetermined spaced position relative to one another to
define said predetermined stacked array, a plurality of nozzles
arranged and constructed to direct an electrolyte between said
set of electrode plates, said electrolyte including water and
metallic particles suspended in said water, whereby said
hydrogen reactor produces hydrogen gas through electrolytic
decomposition of the water; and
a delivery pipe collecting said hydrogen for delivery to
the internal combustion engine.

15. A system for generating a mixture of oxygen and
hydrogen for enriching the fuel in an internal combustion
engine by injecting said mixture into an intake manifold of said
engine while said engine is running, said system comprising:
a reactor formed of a closed chamber, a plurality of
parallel plates secured within said chamber, an electrolyte inlet
including a plurality of nozzles, an electrolyte outlet and a gas
mixture outlet, said nozzles being arranged and constructed to
direct jets of an electrolyte under pressure along said plates;
a circulator connected to said electrolyte inlet and
electrolyte outlet and circulating therebetween, said electrolyte
being formed of a water, hydrogen peroxide and a plurality

Application 13/098,553

metallic particles sized and shaped to promote the formation of
gas bubbles as said electrolyte flows between said plates;
an electric power source connected to some of said plates
to charge said plates to one of a positive and negative polarity;
and
a conduit connecting said reactor to the internal
combustion engine;
wherein a gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is
collected at said outlet, said gas mixture resulting from the
electrolysis of said electrolyte between said plates, said gas
mixture being fed through said conduit to the internal
combustion engine.

Application 13/098,553
DISCUSSION
Appellants do not distinguish between Rejections I, II and III in their
arguments. App. Br. 2-9; Reply Br. 2-5. Generally, Appellants direct their
arguments toward independent claims 1 and 15, and separately argue claim
7. Id. We address each of Rejections I-III in tum.
I

With regard to Rejection I, we select claim 1 as representative and
decide the propriety of Rejection I as to claims 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8-14 based on
the representative claim alone. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv). Separately
argued claim 7 is separately addressed.
Appellants do not dispute the Examiner's finding that Klein discloses
a system for generating hydrogen gas which includes all of the features
recited in claim 1, except that Klein does not provide a plurality of nozzles
arranged and constructed to direct a metal particle-containing electrolyte
between electrode plates. Compare Final Act. 4--5 with App. Br. 2-9; Reply
Br. 2-5. Neither do Appellants dispute the Examiner's determination that it
would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill, in light of the teachings of
Kim, to provide Klein's system with "a forced electrolyte circulating device"
including "a plurality of jets" in order to "flow electrolyte under pressure
between the electrode plates," and thereby enhance the electrolysis
efficiency. Compare Final Act. 5---6 with App. Br. 2-9; Reply Br. 2-5.
Appellants argue that the Examiner incorrectly determined that
Spaziante would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to add metal
particles to the electrolyte used in Klein's hydrogen generator. App. Br. 812. Claims directed to an apparatus must be distinguished from the prior art
based on recited structure. In re Schreiber, 128 F.3d 1473, 1477-78 (Fed.
4

Appeal2015-002033
Application 13/098,553
Cir. 1997); Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Bausch & Lomb Inc., 909 F.2d 1464,
1469 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("[A]pparatus claims cover what a device is, not what
a device does."). The material worked upon by an apparatus ordinarily does
not limit an apparatus claim. Ex parte Thibault, 164 USPQ 666, 667 (Bd.
App. 1969) ("expressions relating the apparatus to contents thereof during an
intended operation are of no significance in determining patentability of the
apparatus claim"). Here, Appellants do not point us to any evidence or
claim language that would support a finding that the particle-containing
electrolyte is a structural element of the claims, or structurally limits the
recited nozzles. To the contrary, the Appellants identify the nozzles only
generically as "a plurality of jets or nozzles," Spec. 13, and that it is the
metal particles which are to be "dimensioned and configured" for passage
through the nozzles, id. at 15. On this record, we are persuaded by the
Examiner's reasoning, Ans. 12, that it would have been obvious to provide
Klein;s apparatus with Kim;s nozzles, and that such nozzles would have
been capable of delivering electrolyte with suitably sized particles. 8
Accordingly, we are persuaded that the Examiner's findings based on
Klein and Kim are sufficient to support Rejection I. Because we do not rely
upon any teaching from Spaziante in reaching our determination,
Appellants' arguments directed to purported deficiencies in the Examiner's
reliance on Spaziante are not persuasive.

8

The Examiner identified the particle-containing electrolyte as a nonlimiting recitation in the Answer. Appellants do not address this point in
their Reply Brief.

Appeal2015-002033
Application 13/098,553

Claim 7

Claim 7 depends from claim 1 and recites that, in use, the electrolyte
is under "sufficient pressure to sweep gas bubbles formed on at least some of
said plurality of electrode plates." The Examiner found, and Appellants do
not dispute, that Kim teaches providing a "forced electrolyte circulating
device (43)" including a "pump (41) ... to flow electrolyte under pressure
between the electrode plates in order to make the bubbles generated between
the electrode plates flow at a rapid speed." Compare Final Act. 5 with App.
Br. 2-9; Reply Br. 2-5.
Appellants contend that adding metal particles to the circulating
electrolyte aids in sweeping bubbles off the electrode plates and improves
process efficiency. App. Br. 12. That fact, however, does not refute the
Examiner's finding that Kim's electrolyte circulating device would be
capable of delivering electrolyte under a pressure sufficient to sweep gas
bubbles, as is recited in claim 7.
We sustain Rejection I.

II
Appellants do not present any separate argument against Rejection II.
Accordingly, we sustain Rejection II for the same reasons given in
connection with Rejection I.

III
With regard to Rejection III, we select claim 15 as representative and
decide the propriety of Rejection III based on the representative claim alone.
See 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv). The Examiner did not rely upon Kim in
6

Appeal2015-002033
Application 13/098,553
support of Rejection III. Instead, the Examiner determined that, in light of
Tzanavaras, it would have been obvious to "direct a respective jet of
electrolyte toward one of the plurality [of] electrode plates." Final Act. 11
(citing Tzanavaras col. 4, 11. 60-68). Tzanavaras discloses an electroplating
apparatus, in which electrolyte jets facilitate turbulent agitation at a substrate
surface during an electroplating operation. Tzanavaras, Abstract. The
Examiner failed to articulate a reason why one of ordinary skill would have
modified Klein's hydrogen generator to include nozzles taught solely in
connection with electroplating. For that reason, we do not sustain the
Examiner's obviousness determination based on Klein, Tzanavaras, and
Spaziante.

New Ground of Rejection

Each of claims 15-17 is rejected on a new ground under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as unpatentable over Klein and Kim.
The apparatus recited in claim 15 includes all the features recited in
claim 1 and further requires "a circulator connected to said electrolyte inlet
and electrolyte outlet," "an electric power source," and a conduit connecting
the hydrogen reactor to an internal combustion engine. See App. Br. 14, 16
(Claims Appendix). Claim 16 specifies that some plates are neutral, and
claim 17 adds that the reactor, circulator and power source "are sized and
shaped for mounting" on the engine. Id. at 17.
The above-mentioned features also are recited in claims 6 and 9,
which the Examiner rejected under Rejection III and which we sustained,
supra, based on the Examiner's findings made in reliance on Klein and Kim.

Particularly, in connection with Rejection I, the Examiner found that Klein
7

Appeal2015-002033
Application 13/098,553

teaches a DC power source and a delivery pipe connecting the hydrogen
generator to an internal combustion engine. Final Act. 5. The Examiner
further found that Kim teaches an electrolyte circulating device to control
electrolyte temperature, and that it would have been obvious to provide
Kim's circulating device in Klein's reactor for that purpose. Id. These
findings are supported by substantial evidence as cited by the Examiner,
Final Act. 4---6, and not contested by Appellants, see App. Br. 2-9; Reply Br.
2-5.
Accordingly, we find each of claims 15-17 to be unpatentable over
Klein and Kim based on the Examiner's undisputed findings regarding those
references in connection with Rejection I of claims 6 and 9.

CONCLUSION
We sustain the Examiner's rejection of claims 1, 2, and 4--14 under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a).
We do not sustain the Examiner's rejection of any of claims 15-17
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
We enter a new ground of rejection, rejecting claims 15-17 under
35 U.S.C. § 103(a).

DECISION
The Examiner's decision is affirmed-in-part and a new ground of
rejection entered.

TIME PERIOD FOR RESPONSE
Regarding the affirmed rejection(s), 37 C.F.R. § 41.52(a)(l) provides
8

Appeal2015-002033
Application 13/098,553
"Appellant may file a single request for rehearing within two months from
the date of the original decision of the Board."
In addition to affirming the Examiner's rejection(s) of one or more
claims, this decision contains new grounds of rejection pursuant to 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.50(b). 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) provides "[a] new ground of rejection
pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered final for judicial review."
37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) also provides that Appellant, WITHIN TWO
MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE DECISION, must exercise one of
the following two options with respect to the new grounds of rejection to
avoid termination of the appeal as to the rejected claims:
( 1) Reopen prosecution. Submit an appropriate amendment of
the claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so
rejected, or both, and have the matter reconsidered by the
Examiner, in which event the proceeding will be remanded to
the Examiner. . . .
(2) Request rehearing. Request that the proceeding be reheard
under§ 41.52 by the Board upon the same record ....
Should Appellant elect to prosecute further before the Examiner
pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b)(l), in order to preserve the right to seek
review under 35 U.S.C. §§ 141or145 with respect to the affirmed rejection,
the effective date of the affirmance is deferred until conclusion of the
prosecution before the Examiner unless, as a mere incident to the limited
prosecution, the affirmed rejection is overcome.
If Appellant elects prosecution before the Examiner and this does not

result in allowance of the application, abandonment or a second appeal, this
case should be returned to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board for final action
on the affirmed rejection, including any timely request for rehearing thereof.
