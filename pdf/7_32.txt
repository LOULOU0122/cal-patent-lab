THE REJECTIONS ON APPEAL 1
Claims 1-5, 7-11, and 29-37 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first
paragraph, as failing to comply with the written description requirement.
1

The Examiner withdrew the "rejection under 35 U.S.C. [§] 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Canty (US 4,323,062) in view of Ewers et al (US
6,939,296)." Ans. 5. Because all of the prior art rejections are based on the
combination of Canty and Ewers (either by themselves or in combination

second paragraph, as being indefinite.

ANALYSIS
The re} ection under 3 5 U.S. C. § 112, first paragraph

Claims 1 and 34
As emphasized by the Examiner, independent claims 1 and 34 recite
"at least one flexible patch ... wherein the at least one patch comprises a
polymer with increased rigidity relative to an underlying portion of the
surgical drape." Final Act. 3. The Examiner states, "[t]here is no support
that the entire patch itself is flexible and of a polymer that has increased
rigidity relative to an underlying portion of the drape." Final Act. 4; see also
Ans. 6.
Appellants disagree with the Examiner and reference paragraph 55 of
Appellants' Specification. App. Br. 6; see also Reply Br. 3. Paragraph 55
states, in relevant part:
The patch 30 can be planar and flexible to conform to underlying
material. In some embodiments, the patch 30 has increased
structural rigidity relative to the portion of the surgical drape it is
affixed to. For example, a patch 30 of silicone can have
increased structural rigidity relative to a polyethylene portion of
a drape 20.
Appellants additionally reference paragraph 38 of Appellants'
Specification. Reply Br. 3--4. Paragraph 38 of Appellants' Specification

with another reference), and because there is no indication that the other
references teach that which is disclosed by the combination of Canty and
Ewers, we consider the Examiner's withdrawal of the "rejection" under 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) to be applicable to all of the asserted prior art rejections.
3

Appeal2014-008955
Application I2/63 I,300
states, in relevant part: "The patch can be of any suitable material, including
a polymer, fabric, textile or a combination thereof and can provide increased
structural rigidity to the surface of the surgical drape."
From the foregoing, it is apparent that Appellants' Specification
provides clear and ample support for "at least one flexible patch ... wherein
the at least one patch comprises a polymer with increased rigidity relative to
an underlying portion of the surgical drape" as recited in claims I and 34.
Accordingly, based on the record presented, we do not sustain the
Examiner's rejection of independent claims I and 34, or of dependent claims
2-5, 7-I I, 29-33, 36, and 37, under 35 U.S.C. § I I2, first paragraph.
Claim 35
Specifically with respect to claim 35, the Examiner states:
Claim 3 5 recites "wherein the at least one patch has a
maximum thickness that is greater than a thickness of the
underlying portion of the surgical drape that the patch is
attached" which is not supported by the original specification.
Applicant's Figures appear to show the patch and drape of being
about the same thickness.
Final Act. 4; see also Figs. IA, IB, IC, 5, and 9A.
In response, Appellants make two arguments. First, Appellants assert
that "[a]t least Figures IA, IB, IC and 5 illustrate the patch 30 having a
thickness greater than that of the drape 20." App. Br. 7; Reply Br. 7.
Second, Appellants assert: "Furthermore, paragraph [0054] of the
specification states that the patch may have thickness up to about 0.5 inches.
Appellant submits that one skilled in the art would understand that such a
patch would have a thickness that is greater than a thickness of a typical
surgical drape." App. Br. 7; Reply Br. 7.

4

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
Appellants' arguments are not persuasive. Turning to Appellants'
first argument that Appellants' drawings illustrate the patch having a
thickness greater than the drape, Appellants' Specification addresses the
supplied drawings stating, "[t]hicknesses and dimensions of some
components may be exaggerated for clarity." Spec. i-f 35. Hence, by
Appellants' own admission, the drawings cannot be relied upon for
representing the true relative thicknesses of the claimed surgical drape and
patch.
Referring to Appellants' second argument that a skilled person would
understand that a patch would be thicker than the drape, Appellants have
provided no support for this allegation, and it is not otherwise self-evident
from the record. That is, the Specification is silent as to the thickness of a
typical surgical drape and as such, there is no dimension to which the
thickness of the patch may be compared. Further, Appellants have provided
no affidavits or other evidence indicating the thickness of a typical drape. In
other words, absent evidentiary support, we consider Appellants' allegation
to be speculative and conclusory. See In re Pearson, 494 F.2d 1399, 1405
(CCPA 1974) ("Attorney's arguments in a brief cannot take the place of
evidence."); see also In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1997); In
re De Blauwe, 736 F.2d 699, 705 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (lawyer arguments and

conclusory statements which are unsupported by factual evidence are
entitled to little probative value). For this reason, we do not accept
Appellants' argument that the patch, even at 0.5 inches in thickness, is
thicker than a typical surgical drape.
Accordingly, based on the record presented, we sustain the
Examiner's rejection of claim 35 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph.

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300

The rejection under 35U.S.C.§112, second paragraph
Regarding this rejection, the Examiner again addresses independent
claims 1 and 34 and their recitation of "at least one flexible patch ...
wherein the at least one patch comprises a polymer with increased rigidity
relative to an underlying portion of the surgical drape." Final Act. 5. The
Examiner links the rejection of claim 1 with its dependent claim 4 and
concludes that the language of those claims, when read together, is
inconsistent. See Ans. 7-8. In particular, the Examiner states:
The arrangement of Claim 4 is exemplified in Figure 3B ... As
discussed above, the disclosure does not specify that the
embodiment of Figure 3B that the second material is flexible or
that the inner portion [] has increased structural rigidity relative
to the portion of the drape to which it is attached. Claim 1
appears to require that the whole patch is made of a flexible
polymer having increased rigidity, whereas claim 4 is now
reciting that the inner portion is flexible and a second portion is
more rigid which is unclear. It is unclear if the recited first and
second materials of claim 4 are different materials (as claimed)
than the polymer material of claim 1.
Ans. 7; see also Final Act. 5.
In response, Appellants again reference paragraph 55 of Appellants'
Specification, and specifically emphasize its teaching that, "[ fJor example,
the inner portion may be thinner than the outer portion and/or the inner
portion may comprise a different, more flexible material than the outer
portion." Reply Br. 9-10. Appellants assert, "[t]his does not mean that the
outer portion is not flexible or is rigid, as the Examiner appears to be
asserting." Reply Br. 10. Appellants conclude:
[T]he present application does not preclude the second material
from being flexible. Further, the present application does not
preclude the inner portion from having increased structural
rigidity relative to the portion of the drape to which it is attached.
6

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
The configuration of Claim 4 provides a patch that has a flexible
inner portion that has increased structural rigidity relative to the
underlying drape and a perimeter portion that is also flexible but
with increased structural rigidity relative to the inner portion.
That is, Claim 4 depends from Claim 1 and simply adds a
structural limitation to the patch and does not contradict Claim 1
many way.
Reply Br. 9.
Appellants' arguments are persuasive. The Examiner fails to
appreciate that the entire patch can be flexible and have increased rigidity
relative to an underlying portion of the surgical drape to which it is attached,
wherein the patch may also have an inner portion with a flexible material
and "a second material with increased structural rigidity" (albeit still
flexible) "about a perimeter of the flexible material of the inner portion" as
claimed. As noted above, each of these possibilities is set forth in paragraph
55 of Appellants' Specification.
Accordingly, based on the record presented, we do not sustain the
rejection of independent claims 1 and 34 and dependent claims 2-5, 7-11,
29-33, and 35-37 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph.
NEW GROUND OF REJECTION
It is understood that "[t]he rejection under 35 U.S.C. [§] 103(a) as

being unpatentable over Canty (US 4,323,0620) in view of Ewers et al (US
6,939,296) has been withdrawn" by the Examiner but that no reason for the
withdrawal has been provided. Ans. 5. However, we enter a new ground of
rejection of claims 1-5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 29-34, 36, and 37 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) for reasons different from, but also in addition to, those stated by
the Examiner. See Final Act. 2-3. We do not enter a new ground of
rejection with respect to claims 9 and 35. This new ground of rejection

7

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
tracks the rejection expressed by the Examiner in the Final Office Action at
pages 5 to 12 (with the exception that we do not adopt that language directed
to claims 9 and 35). We do not replicate this language here but will
reference the Final Office Action as needed.
Regarding the stated rejection of claims 1--4, 8, 11, 29-34, 36, and 37
as being unpatentable over Canty and Ewers (Final Act. 6-10), Appellants
acknowledge the correlation of "reinforcement sheet 14 of Canty as the
surgical drape and the latex sheet 60 as the patch of Claim 1." App. Br. 11;
see also Final Act. 6.

Appellants respond to the rejection stating, "[t]he tubing T of Canty
does not extend through at least the portion of the reinforcement sheet 14
that is attached to the main sheet 12." Appeal Br. 11. There is no claim
requirement that the tubing extend through a portion "attached to the main
sheet 12," only that a "cable, tool, or instrument" extend through a surgical
drape, and Appellants do not explain how Canty fails to teach tube T
extending through sheet 14. 2 See Canty Figs. 8, 9.
"Appellant[s] further submit[] that the latex sheet 60 does not snugly
hold tubing passing therethrough." App. Br. 11. However, Appellants
appear to disregard that portion of Canty which teaches that flap 3 8 is

2

Canty discloses a surgical drape 10 "having a main sheet 12 and a
reinforcement sheet 14" (Canty 2:29-31) and that "sheet 14 is folded"
(Canty 3 :42) to form "a flap 38 comprising the doubled reinforcement sheet
14" (Canty 2:51-52). Canty also teaches that "tubing Tor the like may be
readily threaded through the cross slits 64 in the flap 38 in order to receive
and retain the tubing Tor the like in place during the surgical procedure."
Canty 4: 4--7. Of further interest is Appellants' acknowledgement that
"Canty explains the flap 38 is the member that actually retains the tubing in
place." App. Br. 11.
8

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
formed with "a pair of elongated sheets 58 and 60 of relatively high friction
material, such as latex, on opposed sides of the flap 38." Canty 3 :46-48
(emphasis added); see also Canty Figs. 6-9. Nor is there any dispute that
Canty discloses "cross slits 64 extending through the flap 38 and high
friction sheets 58 and 60" (Canty 3:50-55, emphasis added) or that

cross slits 64 receive tubing T or the like, such that the tabs 66
[formed by the cross slits] frictionally engage against the wall of
the tubing T or the like to retain it in place, with the sheets 58
and 60 of relatively high friction material enhancing the
frictional engagement between the tabs 66 and the tubing T or
the like.
Canty 3:65 to 4:3 (emphasis added). Appellants do not address these
teachings in Canty or explain how they are not applicable to the
limitation/arguments set forth above.
Appellants further contend, "the slits 64 and tabs 66 are defined by the
flap 38, which in tum is defined by the folded reinforcement sheet 14 and
not the latex sheets 58, 60." App. Br. 12 (emphasis added). However; this

contention appears to be contradicted by the above express teachings in
Canty, and Appellants do not explain how this is not the case.
As stated in the rejection, Ewers is relied upon for teaching "providing
a seal made of a flexible polymer material having increased rigidity." Final
Act. 6, referencing Ewers 10:3-16 and 12:8-18. Appellants contend that
"Ewers describes pads or seals that are applied to a patient's abdominal
wall." App. Br. 12; see also id. at 14. Being applied to a patient's
abdominal wall is not germane to the reason Ewers is relied upon.
Appellants further "submit[] that Ewers does not teach or suggest a seal that
has increased rigidity relative to a portion of a surgical drape to which the
seal is attached." App. Br. 13. However, Appellants do not explain how
9

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
there is error in relying on Ewers for teaching a seal whose rigidity, or
flexibility, can be tailored as needed. 3 Further, Appellants' attempt to limit
Ewers' teachings to only "a gel" or a "gel-like" substance (App. Br. 14) is
not accurate. 4
Regarding Appellants' contentions concerning dependent claim 9
(App. Br. 15), as stated above, we do not adopt that portion of the Final
Rejection directed to claim 9. Consequently, the Examiner's withdrawal of
the obviousness rejection of claim 9 remains applicable.
Regarding dependent claim 30, the stated rejection relies on Canty for
disclosing this limitation. Final Act. 8. However, Appellants argue Ewers
in rebuttal. App. Br. 15-16. Appellants' focus on the incorrect reference is
not indicative of any error in the stated rejection.
Regarding dependent claims 31, 33, and 37, Appellants' contentions
do not address Canty's disclosures discussed supra, and particularly those of
patch 60 having cross-slits through which tubing extends See App. Br. 16,
18.

3

When addressing the referenced portions of Ewers, Appellants
acknowledge that they "describe embodiments wherein the seal has layers
that have different rigidity relative to one another." App. Br. 14. However,
Appellants contend that these "passages do not disclose or suggest that a seal
has increased rigidity relative to a portion of a surgical drape to which the
seal is attached." App. Br. 14. However, the stated rejection recites a
reliance on Canty, not Ewers, for disclosing a patch that "is fixably attached
to" a surface of the drape. Final Act. 6.
4
For example, Appellants acknowledge, "Ewers teaches that these pads are
mixtures that can be described as a gel." App. Br. 14; see also Ewers 8:4849. However, Ewers states, "[i]t is contemplated that the material of the pad
35 may also include silicone, soft urethanes and even harder plastics which
might provide the desired sealing qualities with the addition of a foaming
agent." Ewers 8:39--42.
10

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
Regarding dependent claim 35, the stated rejection relies on a scaling
of Figure 7 of Canty (see Final Act. 9), and there is no indication that the
drawings in Canty are drawn to scale. Hence, as stated supra, we do not
adopt the stated rejection of dependent claim 35.
Regarding independent claim 34, Appellants simply contend that this
claim "is patentable over the cited art for at least the several reasons
discussed above in reference to Claim 1." App. Br. 19. Appellants'
contention is not persuasive that the reasons expressed in the stated rejection
of claim 1 are incorrect.
Further, Appellants are not persuasive that the stated reason to
combine Canty and Ewers is faulty. See Final Act. 6.
Regarding the rejection of claim 10 (which depends from claim 8) as
being obvious over Canty, Ewers, and Butterworth (Final Act. 11 ),
Appellants contend that Butterworth does not cure the defects of Canty and
Ewers. App. Br. 19. However, Butterworth was not relied upon for such
curing, instead, the rejection relies on Butterworth to teach a releasable
cover overlying an adhesive. Final Act. 11. Appellants' contention is not
persuasive that this rejection is in error.
DECISION
The Examiner's rejection of claims 1-5, 7-11, 29-34, 36, and 37
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph, is reversed.
The Examiner's rejection of claim 35 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first
paragraph, is affirmed.
The Examiner's rejection of claims 1-5, 7-11, and 29-37 under 35
U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, is reversed.

11

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
We also enter a NEW GROUND of rejection regarding claims 1-5, 7,
8, 10, 11, 29-34, 36, and 37 under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). This New Ground of
Rejection is entered because it relies on reasons different from and/or
additional to those stated by the Examiner and also to provide Appellants a
fair opportunity to respond.
Further, 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) provides that, "[a] new ground of
rejection pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered final for judicial
review." 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b) also provides that Appellants must, WITHIN
TWO MONTHS, exercise one of the following options:
( 1) Reopen prosecution. Submit an appropriate amendment of the
claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected,
or both, and have the matter reconsidered by the examiner, in which
event the proceeding will be remanded to the examiner....
(2) Request rehearing. Request that the proceeding be reheard under§
41.52 by the Board upon the same record ....
Should Appellants elect to prosecute further before the Examiner
pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 41.50(b)(l), in order to preserve the right to seek
review under 35 U.S.C. §§ 141or145 with respect to the affirmed rejection,
the effective date of the affirmance is deferred until conclusion of the
prosecution before the Examiner unless the affirmed rejection is overcome.
If Appellants elect prosecution before the Examiner and this does not

result in allowance of the application, abandonment or a second appeal, this
case should be returned to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board for final action
on the affirmed rejection, including any timely request for rehearing thereof.
In summary, it should be noted that the Examiner's rejections of claim
9 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first and second paragraphs are reversed, and that
12

Appeal2014-008955
Application 12/631,300
the Examiner's rejection of this claim under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) has been
withdrawn.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l)(iv).
