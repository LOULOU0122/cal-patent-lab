DECISION ON APPEAL

Appeal2015-007413
Application 13/013,247
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellants 1 appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from a Final Rejection of
claims 1-20. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We affirm.

THE INVENTION
The application is directed to "a system and method for automatically
selecting sensors." (Spec. i-f 1.) Claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative:
1. A system comprising:
a display unit coupled to a computer processor and configured
to display a map or model of an area monitored by one or more
sensors and to display a location and orientation of the one or
more sensors in the monitored area;
a computer processor configured to receive, via contacting a
screen surface of the display unit, a region or path within the
monitored area, wherein the contacting the display unit
comprises a drawing of the region or path on the screen surface
of the display unit by an operator;
a computer processor configured to orient the one or more
sensors towards the path or region in response to the drawing on
the screen surface of the display unit; and
a computer processor configured to display the monitored
area on the display unit after the orienting of the one or more
sensors.

Appellants identify Honeywell International Inc. as the real party in
interest. (See App. Br. 2.)

THE REJECTIONS

1.

Claims 1---6 and 8-20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a)

as unpatentable over Brunetti and Morgan. (See Final Act. 3-12.)
2.

Claim 7 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as

unpatentable over Brunetti, Morgan, and Cressy. (See Final Act. 12-13.)

APPELLANTS' CONTENTIONS
Appellants argue that the rejections are in error because the
combination fails to teach or suggest "a computer processor configured to
receive, via contacting a screen surface of a display unit, a region or path
within a monitored area, wherein the contacting the display unit comprises a
drawing of the region or path on the screen surface of the display unit by an
operator," as recited in claim 1, and as similarly recited in independent
claims 6 and 15. (App. Br. 7.)

Application 13/013,247
ANALYSIS
The Examiner finds the subject language satisfied in Morgan, which
teaches as follows:
A primary aspect of the preferred embodiment is the use of a
graphics user interface screen 30 between the user and the processor 20. Referring to FIG. 2, the interface screen 30 is designed
to provide a graphical representation (similar to a "map") of the
area that a user chooses to view. Depending on what mode the
network is operating in, the user can simply point to a specific
area on the "map" and the processor 20 will determine which
camera has the best view of that specific area and select that view
to be displayed on one of the monitors. Therefore, instead of
having to deal with switches, buttons and knobs, the user merely
has to point to an area on the touch screen 30 to have a view of
the area displayed. This arrangement significant[ly] reduces the
amount of time necessary to locate and track a particular scene
because only minimal thought process is required. The user
simply points to the desired area on the screen. That area is
instantaneously displayed on a screen.
(Morgan 2:63-3:13.)
Appellants argue that "simply pointing to an area on a screen as in
Morgan is not a disclosure of a drawing of a region or path on a screen by an
operator, as is recited in the claims," because "[a] pointing is a simple, single
touch of the screen," whereas "[t]he terms 'draw' and 'drawing' mean to
make a picture or image by making lines on a surface." (App. Br. 7, citing
www.merriam-webster.com.) Appellants further assert that "a simple
pointing to an area of a screen does not make a picture or image by making a
line on the screen" and that "a drawing requires movement along the screen
while touching the screen, which is more than a simple touch, and which
requires different processing logic than a simple touch." (Id.)

4

Appeal2015-007413
Application 13/013,247
Appellants, thus, appear to argue that the term "drawing," as claimed,
requires the making or rendering of a picture or image on the screen. (Id.)
We are not persuaded of error by Appellants' arguments. In particular, we
do not agree that the claims require that a "picture or image" be rendered on
the screen. The Specification simply states "the operator 120 uses one or
more gestures with his or her hand to define a region of interest 130." (Spec.

i-f 13.) Nowhere does it describe representing that gesture on the screen. 2
We thus conclude that the claims do not require the path or region to be
mirrored on the display. The remaining question, then, is whether Morgan's
disclosure of touching a single point, as opposed to tracing a line or other
shape, would suffice to meet the claim language. We join the Examiner in
concluding that it would, as we do not discern any basis for distinguishing,
in this context, a point indicated by a finger and, for example, a short line or
small circle traced by that same finger.
Because we conclude that Morgan does teach "receiv[ing], via
contacting a screen surface of a display unit, a region or path within a
monitored area, wherein the contacting the display unit comprises a drawing
of the region or path on the screen surface of the display unit by an
operator," as recited in claim 1 and as similarly recited in claims 6 and 15,
we sustain the rejections of claims 1-20.

2

For example, in Figure 2 the region of interest 130 is indicated by semicircular swiping gesture, which is represented in the figure by an arrow
showing the path of the finger movement, but is not shown as being drawn
on the map.

DECISION
The rejections of claims 1-20 are affirmed.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
