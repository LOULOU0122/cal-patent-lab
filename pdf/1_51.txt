Application 12/991,502
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 2
The Invention
Appellants' disclosed and claimed "invention relates to a method and
arrangement in a telecommunication system, in particular to paging
optimization in an evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) applying so called Home
eNodeBs ... [and m]ore particularly, the present invention relates to
methods and arrangements in a gateway node and a core network node for
paging a communication device." Spec. 1, 11. 5-9 ("Technical Field").
Exemplary Claims
Claims 1 and 2, reproduced below, are representative of the subject
matter on appeal (emphases added to contested limitations):
A method in a gateway node for forwarding a
page message to a communication device, wherein the gateway
node serves a plurality of radio base stations, wherein a radio
communication system comprises the gateway node; the
communication device and said plurality of radio base stations,
the method comprising:
1.

receiving the page message and a list of Closed
Subscriber Group (CSG) Identities, in conjunction therewith,
wherein each of the CSG Identities is indicative of which radio
base stations among said plurality of radio base stations the
communication device is allowed to access;

2

Our decision relies upon Appellants' Appeal Brief ("App. Br.," filed
Feb. 19, 2014); Examiner's Answer ("Ans.," mailed June 6, 2014); Final
Office Action ("Final Act.," mailed Aug. 21, 2013); and the original
Specification ("Spec.," filed Nov. 8, 2010). We note Appellants did not file
a Reply Brief in response to the factual findings and legal conclusions in the
Examiner's Answer.

Appeal2015-004677
Application 12/991,502
selecting, based on the list of CSG Identities received in
conjunction with the received page message, a subset of radio
base stations among said plurality of radio base stations; and

forwarding the page message to each radio base station
in the selected subset of radio base stations, whereby the
communication device is paged only via radio base stations that
the communication device is allowed to access.
2.
The method according to Claim 1, further
configuring the gateway node, before receiving the page
message, to select the subset of radio base stations based on the
list of CSG Identities that will be received in conjunction with
the page message.

Prior Art
The Examiner relies upon the following prior art as evidence in
rejecting the claims on appeal:
Gupta et al. ("Gupta") US 2009/0094680 Al

Apr. 9, 2009

Rejections on Appeal
RI.

Claim 2 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second

paragraph, as being indefinite. Ans. 3.
R2.

Claims 1-8 and 14-17 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e)

as being anticipated by Gupta. Ans. 4.
ISSUES AND ANALYSIS
In reaching this decision, we consider all evidence presented and all
arguments actually made by Appellants. We do not consider arguments that
Appellants could have made but chose not to make in the Briefs, and we
deem any such arguments waived. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(l)(iv).

3

Appeal2015-004677
Application I2/99I,502
We agree with particular arguments advanced by Appellants with
respect to the indefiniteness Rejection RI of claim 2 and anticipation
Rejection R2 of claim I for the specific reasons discussed below. We
highlight and address specific findings, arguments, and conclusions
regarding claims I and 2 for emphasis as follows.
1.

§ I I2,

iJ 2 Rejection RI of Claim 2

Issue 1

Appellants argue (App. Br. I 0) the Examiner's rejection of claim 2
under 35 U.S.C. § I I2, second paragraph, as being indefinite is in error.
These contentions present us with the following issue:
Did the Examiner err in concluding "[i]t is confusing how 'to select
the subset of radio base stations based on the list of CSG Identities that will
be received in conjunction with the page message' 'before receiving the page
message', wherein the page message comprises the list of CSG [Closed

Subscriber Group]," in connection with the definiteness of dependent
claim 2 under§ I I2? Ans. 3--4.
Analysis

Appellants contend:
Claim 2 is about configuring the gateway node to be able to
perform a selection step once the CSG identities are received
with the page message. The gateway node would need to be so
configured so that once the page message and CSG identities
are received, it can perform other steps. This claim appears
clear on its face, and Applicants respectfully request
reconsideration and allowance of the claim.
App. Br. IO (emphasis added).

4

Appeal2015-004677
Application 12/991,502
While Appellants' argument appears to be conclusory, relating to
preparatory configuration actions to be taken by the gateway node in
advance of receiving the page message and the actual CSG Identities list, we
do not agree with the Examiner's conclusion that the current recitation of
claim 2 is confusing, and reasonably interpreted as being inconsistent with
the recitations of claim 1.
"[I]f a claim is amenable to two or more plausible claim constructions,
the USPTO is justified in requiring the applicant to more precisely define the
metes and bounds of the claimed invention by holding the claim ...
indefinite." Ex parte Miyazaki, 89 USPQ2d 1207, 1211 (BP AI 2008)
(precedential). See also In re Packard, 751F.3d1307, 1324 (Fed. Cir.
2014), (J. Plager concurring) ("In my view (and that of the per curiam

court), it is within the authority of the USPTO to so interpret the applicable
standard").
We disagree with the Examiner's conclusion of indefiniteness because
claim 1, from which claim 2 depends, recites "receiving the page message
and a list of Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identities, in conjunction

therewith" (emphasis added), which can reasonably be interpreted as the list
of CSG Identities being received at the same time as the page message.
Dependent claim 2 recites, "configuring the gateway node, before receiving

the page message, to select the subset of radio base stations based on the list
of CSG Identities that will be received .... "
Thus, claim 2 does not require, and explicitly disclaims, the page
message needing to be received in order to configure the gateway node. We
read this limitation as merely requiring preparatory action to configure the

5

Appeal2015-004677
Application 12/991,502
gateway node to account for the fact that CSG Identities will be received in
the future. 3
Therefore, on this record, we are persuaded of at least one error in the
Examiner's resulting legal conclusion of indefiniteness of dependent claim 2.
2.

§ 102(e) Rejection R2 of Claims 1-8 and 14--17

Issue 2
Appellants argue (App. Br. 10-12) the Examiner's rejection of claim 1
under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) as being anticipated by Gupta is in error. These
contentions present us with the following issue:
Did the Examiner err in finding the cited prior art discloses a "method
in a gateway node for forwarding a page message to a communication
device" that includes, inter alia, the steps of "receiving the page message
and a list of Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identities, in conjunction
therewith; wherein each of the CSG Identities is indicative of which radio
base stations among said plurality of radio base stations the communication
device is allowed to access," and "forwarding the page message to each
radio base station in the selected subset of radio base stations, whereby the
communication device is paged only via radio base stations that the
communication device is allowed to access," as recited in claim 1?

Analysis
Appellants contend, "Gupta has not been shown to disclose a network
node that forwards any message to a selected subset of radio base stations.
3

Although not before us on Appeal, we leave it to the Examiner to
determine whether claim 2 meets the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C.
§ 112, first paragraph.
6

Appeal2015-004677
Application 12/991,502
Instead, in Gupta, the communication device (or access terminal -

a mobile

phone) requests access to an access point that it may or may not have access
to .... The access point must then determine whether to grant access based
on the access list ... [but] in the present claims, no determination is made
because only radio base stations that have been selected will page the
communications device." App. Br. 11 (citing Gupta i-fi-153-54). In
particular, Appellants contend Gupta does not disclose "receiving" or
"forwarding" a page message, as claimed. Id.
Anticipation of a claim under 35 U.S.C. § 102 occurs when each
claimed element and the claimed arrangement or combination of those
elements is disclosed, inherently or expressly, by a single prior art reference.
Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 593 F.3d 1325, 1332 (Fed. Cir.

2010). A reference inherently discloses an element of a claim "if that
missing characteristic is necessarily present, or inherent, in the single
anticipating reference." Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms.; 339 F.3d 1373;
1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). "Inherency,
however, may not be established by probabilities or possibilities. The mere
fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not
sufficient." Therasense, 593 F.3d at 1332 (citing Cont'! Can Co. USA, Inc.
v. Monsanto Co., 948 F.2d 1264,1269 (Fed. Cir. 1991)).

We agree with Appellants' arguments, and disagree with the
Examiner's findings regarding the disclosure of Gupta. We disagree with the
Examiner because, while Gupta generally discloses access control, there is
no explicit disclosure of a page message, nor is there any evidence of record
that would support a finding that such a page message is inherently disclosed
by the disclosure of Gupta.
7

Appeal2015-004677
Application 12/991,502
Therefore, based upon the findings above, on this record, we are
persuaded of at least one error in the Examiner's reliance on the cited prior
art to disclose the disputed "page message" limitations of claim 1, such that
we cannot sustain the Examiner's anticipation rejection of independent
claim 1, or independent claim 8 which recites the contested limitations in
commensurate form. For the same reasons, we cannot sustain the
anticipation rejection of dependent claims 2-8 and 14--17 which variously
depend from claims 1 and 8.
CONCLUSIONS
(1)

The Examiner erred with respect to indefiniteness Rejection RI

of claim 2 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, and we do not sustain
the rejection.
(2)

The Examiner erred with respect to anticipation Rejection R2 of

claims 1-8 and 14--17 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) over the cited prior art of
record, and we do not sustain the rejection.
DECISION
We reverse the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 1-8 and 14--17.
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with
this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. § 1.136(a)(l )(iv).
