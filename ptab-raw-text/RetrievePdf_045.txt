INTRODUCTION

Background
Petitioner, Micron Technology, Inc. (“Micron”), filed a Petition (IPR2015-

00504, Paper 2, “Pet.”) to institute an inter partes review of claims 1, 9, 10, 12, 30,
32, 42, and 45 (the “challenged claims”) of U.S. Patent No. 5,764,571 (Ex. 1001,
the “’571 Patent”). See 35 U.S.C. § 311. Patent Owner, MLC Intellectual
Property, LLC, filed a Preliminary Response (Paper 7, “Prelim. Resp.”). We have
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 314(a).
Subsequently, Petitioner Unified Patents, Inc. filed a Petition (IPR201500517, Paper 1) to institute an inter partes review of the same challenged claims of
the ’571 Patent. The proposed grounds in each petition are the same and each
reference relied on in the ’504 Petition also is relied on in the ’517 Petition. Both
petitions rely on the same Declaration by Dr. R. Jacob Baker (Ex. 1003), and also
rely on additional exhibits, identical in each. This is acknowledged by Patent
Owner (IPR2015-00517, Paper 7, 2), where Patent Owner points out that Ex. 1011
in the ’504 Petition was not included in the ’517 Petition because it was indicated
as being not available because that exhibit allegedly is confidential. Id. at 2–3.
Patent Owner also suggests that Micron “lift[ed] the Micron Petition and
photocop[ied] the supporting exhibits” (id. at 2), but we need not reach such a
conclusion to decide the merits of the petitions filed. The issues presented in each
case are essentially the same. Accordingly, to facilitate the just, speedy, and
inexpensive resolution of these cases, we address both Petitions in this Decision.2

Patent 5,764,571
We review the Petitions under 35 U.S.C. § 314, which provides that an inter
partes review may not be instituted “unless . . . there is a reasonable likelihood that
the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged in
the petition.”
Based on our review of the record, we conclude that neither Petitioner is
reasonably likely to prevail in demonstrating that at least one of the challenged
claims is not patentable, based on the Petitions filed. See 35 U.S.C. § 314.
B.

Grounds
Petitioners contend that the challenged claims are unpatentable under

35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over two grounds (Pet. 3):
(1) claims 1, 9, 10, 12, 30, 42, and 45 as obvious over Kitamura3; and
(2) claims 1, 9, 12, 30, 32, 42, and 45 as obvious over Mehrotra4.
C.

Related Proceedings
Petitioner states that the ’571 Patent is or was at issue in MLC Intellectual

Property, LLC v. Micron Technology, Inc., No. 3:14-cv-03657 (N.D. Cal.); BTG
International Inc. v. Apple Inc. et al., No. 2:09-cv-00223 (E.D. Tex. July 20,

THE ’571 PATENT

Overview
The ’571 Patent is titled, “Electrically Alterable Non-Volatile Memory with

N-Bits per Cell,” and “relates to non-volatile memory (NVM) devices; and, more
particularly, is concerned with an apparatus and method for programming and/or
verifying programming of a multi-level NVM device with stable reference
voltages.” Ex. 1001, 1:17–21. The ’571 Patent asserts to develop “a multi-bit
semiconductor memory cell that has the non-volatile characteristic of a mask
programmable read-only-memory (ROM) and the electrically alterable
characteristic of a multi-bit per cell DRAM,” such as a multi-bit per cell
electrically alterable non-volatile memory (EANVM). Id. at 2: 31–37.
An embodiment of the ’571 Patent discloses a reading process for a memory
cell configured to store two bits of information, and thus having four memory
states such as (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1), and having three sense amplifiers (154,
156 and 158) to determine the current memory state of the memory cell, as shown
in Figure 6 below. Id. at 7:9–55.

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
Figure 6 is a block diagram for reading a multi-bit per cell EANVM system.
Each of the three sense amplifiers uses a different reference signal/voltage (i.e.,
Ref 1, Ref 2, and Ref 3) to collectively distinguish between the four memory
states, and they collectively output a two bit representation of the memory state at
I/O terminals 162 and 164. Id. at 7:3138.

B.

Illustrative Claim
Of the challenged claims, claims 1, 9, 12, 30, 42, and 45 are independent

claims. Claim 1 is illustrative and recites:
1.

A multi-level memory device comprising:

an electrically alterable non-volatile multi-level memory cell
for storing input information in a corresponding one of Kn
predetermined memory states of said multi-level memory cell, where
K is a base of a predetermined number system, n is a number of bits
stored per cell, and Kn >2;
memory cell programming means for programming said multilevel memory cell in accordance with said input information;
reference voltage selecting means for selecting one of a
plurality of reference voltages in accordance with said input
information, each of said reference voltages corresponding to a
different one of said predetermined memory states; and
comparator means for comparing a voltage of said multi-level
memory cell with the selected reference voltage, said comparator
means further generating a control signal indicating whether the state
of said multi-level memory cell is the state corresponding to said input
information.
Ex. 1001, 12:626.

CLAIM CONSTRUCTION

As a step in our analysis for determining whether to institute a trial, we
interpret the claims. Consistent with the statute and the legislative history of the
Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. No. 11229, 125 Stat. 284 (2011)
(“AIA”), we analyze patentability using the broadest reasonable interpretation of
the claims in an unexpired patent. See 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b); Office Patent Trial
Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg. 48,756–48,963 (Aug. 14, 2012).
For the purposes of this decision, and on this record, we determine that no
claim term needs express interpretation apart from the following. See Vivid Techs.,
Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng’g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (only those
terms which are in controversy need to be construed, and only to the extent
necessary to resolve the controversy).
A.

Reference Voltage Selection
Claim 1 recites “reference voltage selecting means for selecting one of a

plurality of reference voltages,” with claims 9, 12, and 30 reciting “selecting
device which selects one of a plurality of reference signals,” and claims 42 and 45
reciting “selecting one of a plurality of predetermined reference signals.”
Petitioners acknowledge that the means-plus-function element in claim 1 is
“governed by 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 6,” and that the construction of the claim term in
claim 1 “is applicable to claim terms” recited in claims 9, 12, 30, 42, and 45,
discussed above. Pet. 5, 8.
Petitioners assert that “the verify reference voltage select circuit 222 selects
and provides such a reference voltage to the comparator,” and is the corresponding
structure described in the specification. Id. at 56 (citing Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 4552). For

6

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
purposes of this Decision, we construe the referenced claim terms according to that
structure and apply the same to the analysis below.
B.

“Reference Voltages” “Reference Signals”
All of the independent claims of the challenged claims recite either

“reference signals” or “reference voltages.” Petitioners emphasize that “a person
of ordinary skill in the art would have interpreted these features to be broad enough
to include and be met by either a digital reference voltage/ signal or an analog
reference voltage/signal.” Id. at 10 (citing Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 53–58). For purposes of
this Decision, we construe the reference voltages and signals terms as being met by
either digital or analog reference voltages/signals, and apply that construction to
the analysis below.

OBVIOUSNESS OVER KITAMURA

Overview
On the record before us, for the reasons that follow, we are not persuaded

there is a reasonable likelihood that Petitioners will prevail in demonstrating that
the challenged claims are unpatentable over Kitamura.
Petitioners contend that challenged claims 1, 9, 10, 12, 30, 42, and 45 are
unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Kitamura. Pet. 19–38. Specifically,
Petitioners argue that Kitamura teaches most aspects of the claimed subject matter,
and proposes to modify Kitamura by combining specific circuitry disclosed “for
use in performing the programming function (e.g., applying a program signal) of
the ‘memory cell programming means’ and ‘programming signal source.’” Id. at
25–26. Patent Owner counters that Kitamura does not teach or suggest a

7

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
“reference voltage selecting means,” or “reference voltages,” per the challenged
claims. Prelim. Resp. 4–10.
B.

Analysis
Petitioners contend that Kitamura discloses an electrically alterable, non-

volatile memory device with a memory cell capable of storing two bits of
information, requiring four memory states. Pet. 19–20 (citing Ex. 1010 ¶ 6).

Figure 1 of Kitamura illustrates a block diagram for its memory device.
Petitioners contend that the memory device of Kitamura includes memory
cell 1, which can be programmed to one of four memory states. Ex. 1010 ¶¶ 9, 14.
The cell is programmed by iteratively applying writing signals/programming
pulses to the cell to move the memory state to its desired state, whereby the
programming ceases when then device determines that the memory cell is correctly
programmed based on a comparison of a signal representing the current memory
state of the cell with a signal representing the desired memory state (9 in Fig. 1).

8

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
Id. The desired memory state signal is produced by D/A (digital-to-analog)
conversion circuit 10 based on the inputs B0 and B1. Id. at ¶¶ 9–11, 14. The
memory device also includes A/D (analog-to-digital) conversion circuit 13 to read
and output (D0 and D1) the current state of the memory cell. Id.
Petitioners also contend that “the D/A conversion circuit 10 converts the two
digital bits B0 and B1 to an analog signal by selecting the analog signal that
corresponds to bits B0 and B1,” and provide a mapping table (Table 1) as an
example of input B0 and B1 values and output analog signals. Pet. 22–23.
Petitioners’ declarant, Dr. R. Jacob Baker, further provides that one of ordinary
skill in the art would have known to configure the output voltages of D/A
conversion circuit 10 to be toward the middle of ranges used to read the different
states to reduce false reads. Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 74–75. Dr. Baker also provides that the
output of the D/A conversion circuit may be non-linear or random in the circuits
employed by Kitamura. Id. at ¶ 76. Dr. Baker continues with an example of how
an output voltage may be chosen (id. at ¶¶ 77–79), but this discussion goes beyond
and indeed, does not cite to the explicit disclosure of Kitamura.
Patent Owner contends that based on evidence and arguments submitted in
the Petitions, Petitioners have not demonstrated that the D/A conversion circuit
makes a selection of any type, or selects among a plurality of reference voltages.
Prelim. Resp. 6. Patent Owner elaborates that both Kitamura and Petitioners
discuss the D/A conversion circuit as converting the input bits, not selecting a
reference signal or voltage, and that selection cannot mean the same as conversion
if applying plain meanings to both terms. Id. at 6–8. Lastly, Patent Owner points
out that Petitioners have relied solely upon D/A conversion circuit 10 of Kitamura
to teach the selecting device / selecting one of a plurality of reference signals in

9

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
accordance with the input information elements of the claims. Id. at 9–10 (citing
Pet. 29–30). We agree with Patent Owner.
Kitamura is largely silent as to the specific functioning of the D/A
conversion circuit 10. Kitamura discloses that D/A conversion circuit 10 and A/D
conversion circuit 13 “preferably share a voltage dividing element and a reference
voltage supply (for the purpose of making their characteristics uniform),” and level
differences to maximize the operating margin (Ex. 1010 ¶ 11), but does not
disclose a “selection” between reference voltages or signals. Although Petitioners
emphasize the obviousness of certain elements of the challenged claims (Pet. 25–
26), the obviousness of selecting a reference voltage versus outputting a voltage
from a D/A conversion is not discussed. Indeed, Dr. Baker’s discussion is clear
(Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 74–79) as to how the output voltages could be set, but it remains
unclear how Kitamura itself suggests the examples proffered. The normal function
of a D/A converter is not to select between reference voltages, but to render the
digital input into analog form. We are not persuaded that Kitamura teaches or
suggests the selection of one of a plurality of reference voltages in accordance with
the input information, per the challenged claims. In addition, the Petitions fail to
provide any rationale for why Kitamura’s disclosure of D/A conversion renders the
selection of a reference voltage or signal obvious.
For these reasons, Patent Owner’s contentions that Kitamura does not teach
or suggest “reference voltage selecting means,” or equivalent elements, or
“reference voltages,” per the challenged claims, are persuasive.
C.

Conclusion
Having considered the Petitions and Patent Owner’s Preliminary Response,

we determine that Petitioners have not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of

10

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
prevailing in establishing that challenged claims 1, 9, 10, 12, 30, 42, and 45 are
unpatentable as obvious over Kitamura.

OBVIOUSNESS OVER MEHROTRA

Overview
On the record before us, for the reasons that follow, we are not persuaded

there is a reasonable likelihood that Petitioners will prevail in demonstrating that
the challenged claims are unpatentable over Mehrotra.
Petitioners contend that challenged claims 1, 9, 12, 30, 32, 42, and 45 are
unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over Mehrotra. Pet. 38–58. Specifically,
Petitioners argue that Mehrotra teaches most aspects of the claimed subject matter,
and proposes that it would have been obvious to implement digital and analog
versions of the verification elements of the challenged claims. Id. at 42–45. Patent
Owner counters that Mehrotra does not teach or suggest a “reference voltage
selecting means,” per the challenged claims. Prelim. Resp. 10–16.
B.

Analysis
Petitioners contend that Mehrotra discloses an electrically alterable, non-

volatile memory device with memory cells each capable of storing more than one
bit of information. Pet. 38 (citing Ex. 1004, 2:14–15). Mehrotra’s memory device
130 includes Read Circuits 220 to read the current memory state of a memory cell
in Addressable EEPROM Array 60, Read/Program Latches and Shift Registers
(RPLSR) 190 to select and determine the reference signal corresponding to the
desired memory state for a memory cell, and Compare Circuit 200, as illustrated in
Figure 5, reproduced below. Id. at 7:59–8:27.

11

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571

Figure 5 (partial) is a block diagram for Mehrotra’s EEPROM system.
Petitioners also contend that the Compare Circuit receives information from
the RPLSR and information corresponding to the current memory state of the
memory cell through the Read Circuits, and compares the current memory state to
the desired memory state to determine if the memory cell is correctly programmed
to the desired memory state. Pet. 39 (citing Ex. 1004, 20:4–16).
Patent Owner contends that Petitioners have purported to identify the
“reference voltage selection means” as the RPLSR circuit of Mehrotra, but such a
circuit does not make a selection, per the challenged claims. Prelim. Resp. 11.
12

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
Patent Owner continues that Mehrotra discloses that data to be programmed into a
memory cell are latched or stored in the RPLSR circuit, but that Petitioners have
provided “no evidence that latching or storing of data bits involves a ‘selection’ or
a selection of ‘one of a plurality of voltage references.’” Id. at 11–12 (citing Ex.
1004, 19:27–56, 65–66). Additionally, Patent Owner points out that Mehrotra’s
RPLSR circuit provides a similar function to the 2-bit input latch/buffer 224,
discussed in the ’571 Patent (Ex. 1001, 8:40–43, Fig. 8), which is different from
the verify reference voltage select circuit 222, also discussed in the ’571 Patent and
acknowledged by Petitioners as the corresponding structure for the claimed
“reference voltage selecting means.” Prelim. Resp. 14–15. Lastly, Patent Owner
argues that Mehrotra also fails to disclose “a plurality of reference voltages in
accordance with said input information.” Id. at 16. We agree with Patent Owner.
Petitioners allege that “the RPLSR 190, selects and provides a voltage or
current signal(s) or waveform(s) that represents the desired memory state to the
Compare Circuit.” Pet. 40. However, Mehrotra details that “the data [are] staged
for programming the addressed cell by being sent via a serial data line 259 to a set
of read/program latches and shift registers 190.” Ex. 1004, 8:25–27. This
indicates that the RPLSR receives data and sets registers, but does not disclose that
a reference voltage or signal, from a plurality of reference signals or voltages, is
selected by the RPLSR, per the challenged claims. Although it appears that the
RPLSR produces a reference signal, representing the input information in bit form
of the desired memory state, we are not persuaded that this is the same as the
selection of one of a plurality of reference voltages in accordance with the input
information, per the challenged claims.
In addition, Petitioners and Petitioners’ declarant, Dr. Baker, discuss at
length the obviousness of producing an analog implementation of Mehrotra’s
13

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
digital verify process through the Compare Circuit (Pet. 42–45, Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 98–
104). Although it might have been obvious to devise an analog implementation of
Mehrotra’s verify process, Mehrotra provides no teaching or suggestion that such
an implementation would select a reference voltage or signal in such an analog
implementation. Any analog implementation of a digital process, and vice versa,
would maintain the same function prescribed, to be considered obvious. Without
some other suggestion for the selection of a reference voltage or signal, we are not
persuaded that such a transformation (digital to analog) would necessarily meet the
limitations of the challenged claims.
Additionally, although Petitioners and Dr. Baker discuss Kokubun5 and Lee6
with respect to analog voltage comparison circuits for memory devices being
generally well known in the art (Pet. 43, Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 98–100), we agree with
Patent Owner that Petitioners have not sought institution of grounds over Mehrotra
in combination with Kokubun, Lee, or some combination of all three. Prelim.
Resp. 17. There is no discussion in the Petitions of such combinations and the
mere recitation of elements being prior art is not necessarily sufficient to show
obviousness. “[A] patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious
merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was, independently, known in
the prior art.” KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007).
For these reasons, Patent Owner’s contentions that Mehrotra does not teach
or suggest “reference voltage selecting means,” or equivalents, per the challenged
claims, are persuasive.

Conclusion
Having considered the Petitions and Patent Owner’s Preliminary Response,

we determine that Petitioners have not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of
prevailing in establishing that challenged claims 1, 9, 12, 30, 32, 42, and 45 are
unpatentable as obvious over Mehrotra.

VI.

DUPLICATION OF EFFORT

Patent Owner contends that the grounds of the ’517 Petition should be
denied because they are duplicative of the grounds provided in the ’504 Petition.
IPR2015-00517, Prelim. Resp. 19–20. Given that we institute on no ground
recited in either Petition, Patent Owner’s contentions are moot.

VII. MOTION TO SEAL
Petitioner Micron also filed a Motion to Seal (IPR2015-00504, Paper 3),
requesting that the Infringement Contentions filed as Exhibit 1011 to the Petition
be treated as Protective Order Material and be sealed such that Exhibit 1011 is
available only to the Board, and parties to the Petition in accord with 37 C.F.R. §
42.55. Petitioner Micron asserts that the Exhibit contains proprietary information
(“[t]he Infringement Contentions include proprietary information concerning
the operation of Petitioner’s products, which is information not publically made
available by Petitioner”), and sought use of the default protective order set forth in
the Office Patent Trial Practice Guide. Paper 3, 1–2. Patent Owner has not
opposed this Motion.
The standard for granting a motion to seal is “good cause,” reflecting the
strong public policy for making all information in inter partes review proceedings

15

IPR2015-00504
IPR2015-00517
Patent 5,764,571
open to the public. 37 C.F.R. § 42.54. The moving party bears the burden of
showing that the relief requested should be granted. 37 C.F.R. § 42.20(c). This
includes showing that the information is truly confidential, and that such
confidentiality outweighs the strong public interest in having an open record. See
Garmin Int’l v. Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC, Case IPR2012-00001, slip op. at 3
(PTAB Mar. 14, 2013) (Paper 36). Petitioner Micron has made a sufficient
showing.
Accordingly, the Motion to Seal Exhibit 1011 is granted.

VIII. ORDER
For the reasons given:
It is ORDERED that the Petitions are denied as to all challenged claims;
It is FURTHER ORDERED that no inter partes review is instituted;
It is FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner Micron’s Motion to Seal is
granted;
It is FURTHER ORDERED that the proposed protective order appended as
Exhibit A to Paper 3 (IPR2015-00504) is entered in this proceeding;
It is FURTHER ORDERED that Exhibit 1011 in IPR2015-00504
remains sealed.
