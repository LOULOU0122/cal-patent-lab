UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE
BEFORE THE PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD
BLACKHAWK SPECIALITY TOOLS, LLC,
Petitioner,
v.
WEATHERFORD INTERNATIONAL, LLC,
Patent Owner.
Case IPR2015-00892
Patent 5,575,333

Before MEREDITH C. PETRAVICK, JAMES P. CALVE, and
JAMES A. WORTH, Administrative Patent Judges.
WORTH, Administrative Patent Judge.

ORDER
Termination of the Proceeding
37 C.F.R. § 42.74

Pursuant to our e-mail authorization, on October 6, 2015, the parties
filed a Joint Motion to Terminate Proceedings (Paper 17, “Joint Mot.”)
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 317(a), as well as 37 C.F.R. §§ 42.72 and 42.74(a).
Contemporaneously, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 317(b) and 37 C.F.R.

IPR2015-00892
Patent 5,575,333
§ 42.74(c), the parties filed a Joint Request that the Termination Agreement
Be Treated as Business Confidential Information and Kept Separate (Paper
18), including true copies of a Settlement Agreement (Ex. 1014, referred to
by the parties as a “Termination Agreement” or “Agreement”).
The parties previously have identified a related, co-pending U.S.
litigation between the parties (Pet. 1; Paper 5, 1; Prelim. Resp. 3 n.1) and
now inform us that “the district court has recently confirmed the dismissal of
the pending action between Weatherford and Blackhawk involving the ‘333
Patent.” Joint Mot. 5. Further, the parties inform us that “[o]ther than as
indicated in the Agreement, there are no written or oral agreements or
understandings, including any collateral agreements, between the parties,
including but not limited to licenses, covenants not to sue, confidentiality
agreements, or agreements of any kind, that are made in connection with, or
in contemplation of, the termination of this proceeding.” Id. at 4. Thus, we
understand that the filed agreement settles all disputes between the parties
with respect to this proceeding. Under these circumstances, we determine
that good cause exists to terminate this proceeding, without rendering a final
written decision.
ORDER
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that the Joint Motion to Terminate is granted;
FURTHER ORDERED that Joint Request that the Termination
Agreement Be Treated as Business Confidential Information and Kept
Separate is granted;

IPR2015-00892
Patent 5,575,333
FURTHER ORDERED that the Termination Agreement included in
Ex. 1014 shall be treated as business confidential information, to be kept
separate from the patent file; and
FURTHER ORDERED that the case is terminated.
