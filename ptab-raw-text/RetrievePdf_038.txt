DECISION
Denying Request for Rehearing
37 C.F.R. § 42.71
Petitioner filed a Request for Rehearing (Paper 10, “Rehearing Req.”)
of our decision denying institution of inter partes review (Paper 9, “Dec.”)
of claims 1–26 of U.S. Patent No. 5,718,737 (Ex. 1001, “the ’737 patent”).
We deny the Request for Rehearing for reasons that follow.

ANALYSIS
When considering a request for rehearing, the Board reviews its
decision for an abuse of discretion. 37 C.F.R. § 42.71(c). The party
requesting rehearing bears the burden of showing that the decision should be
modified, and “[t]he request must specifically identify all matters the party
believes the Board misapprehended or overlooked.” Id. at § 42.71(d).
Petitioner seeks rehearing of the Board’s denial of inter partes review
of (1) claims 1–26 as having been obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over
Wilsker, 1 Nix,2 Dusdorf, 3 and Baltazar4 in view of knowledge of one skilled
in the art; (2) claims 1–26 as anticipated under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) by Nix;
and (3) claims 1, 6–9, 15–18, and 24–26 as anticipated under 35 U.S.C.
§ 102(b) by Wilsker. Rehearing Req. 1. We address those issues below.
A. Obviousness over Wilsker, Nix, Dusdorf, and Baltazar
Petitioner avers that the Board misapprehended that (1) a glass’s
redox number determines its “remaining” color; (2) Nix explicitly teaches

how to adjust the redox number and, thus, the “remaining” color of a glass
batch; and (3) Wilsker, Dusdorf, and Baltazar each solve the same problem
and, therefore, would have been combined by a person of ordinary skill in
the art. Rehearing Req. 4. We considered, but found unpersuasive, those
same arguments in the Petition (Paper 1, “Pet.”). Rather than pointing out
any matter misapprehended or overlooked, the Request for Rehearing
expresses disagreement with the panel’s determination and attempts to offer
additional reasoning or argument to make out Petitioner’s case.
Ultimately, the Petition fails to identify disclosure in the applied prior
art of the specified method steps of (1) adding a decolorizing or colorizing
agent that selectively decolorizes or enhances a color of mixed color glass
cullet; and (2) creating a glass product of a “remaining” or “particular”
color, as required by each independent challenged claim. Ex. 1001, 7:39-54
(claim 1); 8:22–27 (claim 9); 9:1–6 (claim 18). Petitioner again argues that
“Nix discloses how to control color by adjusting a single variable (redox
number) using any number of reducing or oxidizing agents, in any amounts.”
Rehearing Req. 6. As we stated in our Decision, however, that assertion
misstates the disclosure of Nix. Dec. 10.
Nix is not shown to disclose a method of creating recycled glass
products from mixed color glass cullet by adding decolorizing or colorizing
agents in order to control the final color of a glass product. See id. at 10–11
(determining that the Petition does not identify any such disclosure in Nix).
Petitioner argues that Nix teaches a method by which one of ordinary skill in
the art could “increase or decrease the batch redox number until a target
color is achieved,” Rehearing Req. 6 (quoting Pet. 19 (emphasis added by
Petitioner)) (citing Ex. 1004, p. 272, Table 1), but the table in Nix, upon
3

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
which Petitioner relies, does not suggest using decolorizing or colorizing
agents to create recycled glass products of a “particular” or “remaining”
color in the manner recited in the challenged claims.
Petitioner again directs us to Nix’s disclosure that “the redox state of a
glass batch is of extreme importance for forecasting the colour [sic].” Id. at 9
(quoting Pet. 18 (citing Ex. 1004, p. 271ll. 5–6) (emphasis added by
Petitioner). For reasons stated in our Decision, however, Nix’s reference to
“forecasting” the color of an existing batch is not shown to suggest a method
for adding a decolorizing or colorizing agent to selectively decolorize or
enhance a color in mixed colored glass cullet and for creating recycled glass
products of a remaining or particular color. Id.; see Dec. 8–11 (explaining
the Board’s reasoning). Petitioner’s views in that regard are no more
persuasive in the Request for Rehearing than in the Petition.
Petitioner presents new argument in the Request for Rehearing,
which, because it is new, could not have been misapprehended or
overlooked in our Decision. For example, Petitioner argues for the first time
in the Request for Rehearing that carbon enhances “dead leaf green” color in
Nix’s cullet-containing batch. Rehearing Req. 6–8. That new argument
suggests, at best, that carbon can be used to enhance green as opposed to
amber color, depending on the other ingredients and conditions of a given
glass batch. Id. Petitioner does not establish, however, that Nix discloses an
addition of carbon to selectively enhance the “dead leaf green” color in
Nix’s example of a laboratory glass melt. Id.; see Pet. 18 (quoting Ex. 1004,
278). Here again, we are mindful that the claims cover a method of adding
ingredients that selectively decolorize or enhance a cullet color to create a
recycled glass product of a “remaining” or “particular” color—and Nix’s
4

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
example is not shown to disclose any such selective decolorization or
enhancement. Ex. 1001, 7:39-54 (claim 1); 8:22–27 (claim 9); 9:1–6 (claim
18); see Pet. 18–20; see also Dec. 9–11. Petitioner does not direct us to
disclosure in Nix suggesting that carbon or any other glass batch addition is
used to selectively decolorize or enhance a color of mixed color glass cullet
so as to produce recycled glass products of a “remaining” or “particular”
color.
Petitioner also argues, for the first time in the Request for Rehearing,
that Nix suggests a method of producing amber glass “by using a reducing
agent above the melt.” Rehearing Req. 10. That argument was not raised in
the Petition and cannot form the basis for a successful rehearing request. In
any event, the Petition does not establish adequately that “a reducing
atmosphere above the melt” (id.) represents the addition of a colorizing
agent to the “mixed color glass cullet” (Ex. 1001, 7:45–46), the “glass melt”
(id. at 8:22), or the “virgin batch mixture” (id. at 9:1) as specified in the
challenged claims.
Petitioner avers that the Board misapprehended or overlooked other
arguments regarding the combined disclosures of Nix, Wilsker, Dusdorf, and
Baltazar. Rehearing Req. 11–14. We considered those arguments, but
found them inadequate to support institution of inter partes review. For
example, we acknowledged that Wilsker relates to a method of nullifying a
bluish-green color. Dec. 12. But for reasons stated in our Decision, Wilsker
is not shown to disclose a method that includes “a selective decolorization or
colorization of ‘unsorted mixed color glass cullet’ as required by each
challenged claim.” Id. (citing Ex. 1001, 7:45–47; 8:22–24; 9:2–5
(independent claims 1, 9, and 18)). Nor does the Petition show sufficiently
5

IPR2015-00944
Patent 5,718,737
that the limitation is suggested by Baltzar’s “colorant adjustment” (Ex. 1008,
50), or Dusdorf’s “batch correction” (Ex. 1007, 1, 6). Dec. 13–14; Pet. 46–
47.
Petitioner urges that, notwithstanding the lack of “precise teachings
directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim[s],” the Board
should “take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of
ordinary skill in the art would employ” when combining “familiar elements
according to known methods” that do “no more than yield predictable
results.” Rehearing Req. 4 (quotation omitted) (emphasis supplied by
Petitioner omitted). The Petition, however, fails to show sufficiently that
manipulating the ingredients of a glass melt, to decolorize or enhance a color
of mixed color glass cullet, would have been a “predictable use of prior art
elements according to their established functions.” KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex,
Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 417 (2007). The Petition also fails to explain adequately
how a person of ordinary skill in the art, employing inferences and creative
steps, would have been led to modify and combine the teachings of the cited
references in a manner that would have resulted in a method for creating
recycled glass products as recited in the challenged claims.
The Request for Rehearing does not establish error in our Decision
declining review based on the ground of obviousness over the combined
disclosures of Wilsker, Nix, Dusdorf and Baltazar.

B. Grounds Based on Anticipation by Nix or Wilsker
The anticipation grounds depend on argument that Nix or, in the
alternative, Wilsker, discloses with anticipatory specificity the addition of
colorizing or decolorizing agents to enable the manufacture, from mixed
color glass cullet, of glass products of a “particular” or “remaining” color.
Dec. 15–16. As stated above in our analysis of the obviousness ground,
nothing in the Request for Rehearing persuades us that we abused our
discretion in determining that the Petition does not identify such a disclosure
in Nix or Wilsker.
The Request for Rehearing again argues that Nix teaches a step of
creating a recycled glass product of a “remaining” or “particular” color.
Rehearing Req. 14. Although Nix refers generally to “[m]odern container
glass batches [that] include appreciable quantities of recycled cullet,”
Ex. 1004, 271, Petitioner does not show sufficiently that Nix discloses a
method of creating recycled glass products of a “remaining” or “particular”
color starting from mixed color glass cullet. See Dec. 15. Nor, as discussed
above, does Petitioner show sufficiently that Nix discloses the addition of a
decolorizing or colorizing agent for selectively decolorizing or enhancing a
color of such cullet.
The Request for Rehearing does not establish error in our Decision
declining review based on the grounds of anticipation by Nix or Wilsker.
CONCLUSION
We deny Petitioner’s Request for Rehearing.
