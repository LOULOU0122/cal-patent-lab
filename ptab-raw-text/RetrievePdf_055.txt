IPR2015-01454 (Patent 8,549,310 B2)
Pursuant to our authorization, the parties filed Joint Motions to
Terminate each of the captioned proceedings on January 5, 2016. Paper 22.2
For each proceeding, the parties represent that the “Parties have resolved
their disputes and executed a settlement agreement to request termination of
this proceeding and dismissal of the Parties’ related proceeding regarding
the [subject] patent[s]: Sensus USA, Inc. v. Certified Measurement, LLC,
No. 3:14-cv-1069 (D. Conn.).” Id. at 3. With each of their Motions to
Terminate, the parties filed what they represent is a “true and correct copy”
of the parties’ written settlement agreement as Exhibit 2003.3 Id. at 6. The
parties additionally represent that “[t]here are no other agreements, oral or
written, between the parties made in connection with, or in contemplation of,
the termination of these proceedings.” Id. In concurrently filed Motions to
File Settlement Agreement as Business Confidential Information, the parties
request that the agreement be treated as business confidential information
and be kept separate from the file of the respectively involved patents.
Paper 23.
“An inter partes review instituted under this chapter shall be
terminated with respect to any petitioner upon the joint request of the
petitioner and the patent owner, unless the Office has decided the merits of
the proceeding before the request for termination is filed.” 35 U.S.C.
§ 317(a). The Office has not yet decided the merits of the proceeding, which
remains at an early stage. We determine that good cause exists to terminate

IPR2015-01262 (Patent 5,828,751)
IPR2015-01454 (Patent 8,549,310 B2)
each proceeding with respect to all parties without rendering a final written
decision.
At the request of a party to the proceeding, the agreement or
understanding shall be treated as business confidential
information, shall be kept separate from the file of the involved
patents, and shall be made available only to Federal
Government agencies on written request, or to any person on a
showing of good cause.
35 U.S.C. § 317(b). After reviewing the parties’ settlement agreement, we
find that the settlement agreement contains confidential business information
regarding the terms of settlement. We determine that good cause exists to
treat the settlement agreement as business confidential information pursuant
to 35 U.S.C. § 317(b).

It is
ORDERED that the joint Motions to Terminate are granted;
FURTHER ORDERED that these proceeding are hereby terminated
as to both Petitioner and Patent Owner;
FURTHER ORDERED that the joint Motions to File Settlement
Agreement as Business Confidential Information are granted; and
FURTHER ORDERED that the filed settlement agreement (Ex. 2003
in IPR2015-01262; Ex. 2002 in IPR2015-01454) be treated as business
confidential information pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 317(b) and 37 C.F.R.
§ 42.74(c) and also remain designated as “Parties and Board Only” in PRPS.
