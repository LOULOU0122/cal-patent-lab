IPR2015-01391
Patent 5,825,898
I. DISCUSSION
On October 16, 2015, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Terminate this
proceeding (Paper 6), a true copy of the parties’ settlement agreement (Ex. 2001),
and a request to treat the settlement agreement as business confidential information
under 35 U.S.C. § 317(b) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.74(c) (Paper 7).
This proceeding is still in its preliminary stages. Petitioner, Realtek
Semiconductor Corporation (“Realtek”), filed a Petition requesting an inter partes
review of claims 1–28 of U.S. Patent No. 5,825,898 (“the ’898 patent”). Paper 1.
Patent Owner, Andrea Electronics Corporation (“Andrea”), has not filed a
Preliminary Response, and we have not entered a decision whether or not to
institute an inter partes review.
In the Joint Motion to Terminate this proceeding, the parties represent that
they have settled their disputes regarding the ’898 patent. Paper 6, 2. The parties
identify the following related matters: (1) the ’898 patent was asserted against
multiple companies in the United States Court for the Eastern District of New
York; (2) the ’898 patent is the subject of an International Trade Commission
investigation; and (3) in the United States Court for the Northern District of
California Realtek filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Andrea concerning a
licensing agreement related to the ’898 patent. Id. at 2–4. The parties, however,
do not represent that the ’898 patent is involved in any other proceedings before
the Office. See generally id. Under these circumstances, we determine that it is
appropriate to terminate this proceeding without rendering any further decisions.
See 37 C.F.R. § 42.72.
