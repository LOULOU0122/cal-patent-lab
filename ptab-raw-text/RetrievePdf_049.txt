CBM2015-00154
Patent 5,816,918
I.

INTRODUCTION
Intermix Media, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition (Paper 1, “Pet.”),

requesting institution of a covered business method patent review of claims
1–34, 38, 39, and 45–77 of U.S. Patent No. 5,816,918 (Ex. 1001, “the ’918
patent”). Bally Gaming, Inc. (“Patent Owner”) filed a Preliminary Response
(Paper 9, “Prelim. Resp.”). We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 324.
We determine that information in the Petition does not demonstrate it
is more likely than not that Petitioner would prevail with respect to claims
1–34, 38, 39, and 45–77 of the ’918 patent. 35 U.S.C. § 324(a).
Accordingly, we do not institute a covered business method patent review as
to those claims for the reasons that follow.
A. Related Proceedings
The ’918 patent is the subject of Bally Gaming, Inc. v. eUniverse, Inc.,
No. 3:03-cv-0062-LRH-VPC (D. Nev.) and Bally Gaming, Inc. v.
Worldwinner.com Inc., No. 3:03-cv-0063-LRH-VPC (D. Nev.). Pet. 14;
Paper 5, 1–2.
The ’918 patent was also the subject of Reexamination No.
90/006,601, and an ex parte Reexamination Certificate issued on June 30,
2014 that canceled claims 35–37 and 40–44 and amended claims 34, 38, 39,
45, and 46. Additionally, claims 1, 3, 15–22, 24, 25, 28, 32–34, 39, 73–75
and 77 of the ’918 patent have been challenged in related covered business
method patent review CBM2015-00155.
B. The ’918 Patent (Ex. 1001)
The ’918 patent relates to “redemption games allowing a player to
receive one or more prizes in connection with playing the game.” Ex. 1001,
1:16–19. Figure 1 of the ’918 patent is reproduced below.

Patent 5,816,918

Figure 1 is a block diagram of a game apparatus. Id. at 4:62–63,
5:49–51. The ’918 patent states that “prize information is automatically
determined for each of the prizes, the prize information being determined in
view of a desired profitability of the game apparatus.” Id. at 4:1–4. Game
unit 10 can include game processor 12; monetary input device 14 that, for
example, can be a coin deposit slot or credit card reader; player input device
16 such as buttons, keyboards, dials, joystick controls, touch screen, track
ball, or any other input used in playing a game; game output device 18, such
as display screen 56; universal ticket dispenser 20 that can dispense
vouchers for redeeming prizes; specific prize ticket dispenser 22; and
communication device 24 for optionally communicating with other game
apparatuses. Id. at 6:10–14, 6:34–50, 7:4–10, 7:52–61, 8:13, 8:32–35,
11:35–39.
Of the challenged claims, claims 1, 15, 21, 34, 38, 39, 45, 47, 59, and
73 are independent, and claims 34, 38, 39, and 45 were amended during
reexamination. Claim 1 is reproduced below:
3

CBM2015-00154
Patent 5,816,918
1. A method for providing a prize redemption system for
a game apparatus, said prize redemption system being
customizable by an operator, said method comprising:
receiving a prize list on a game apparatus, said prize list
including names of a plurality of prizes available to be won by
playing said game apparatus, wherein said game apparatus
receives monetary income from players in exchange for use of
said game apparatus, and wherein said players may win prize
credits by playing said game apparatus;
receiving a cost of each of said prizes on said game
apparatus; and
determining on said game apparatus a prize cost to be
associated with each of said plurality of prizes, said prize cost
being in terms of prize credits and determined in view of a
desired profitability of said game apparatus, and wherein a player
of said game apparatus may select one of said prizes by
exchanging a number of prize credits equal to said prize cost of
said selected prize.
C. Challenge
Petitioner solely challenges claims 1–34, 38, 39, and 45–77 as
unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Pet. 1, 15–80.

II.

ANALYSIS
A. Asserted Ground Under 35 U.S.C. § 101
On the merits, the information in the Petition does not demonstrate it

is more likely than not that claims 1–34, 38, 39, and 45–77 of the ’918
patent are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101.
In Alice Corp. Pty, Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014), the
Supreme Court clarified the process for analyzing claims to determine
whether claims are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. In Alice, the
Supreme Court applied the framework set forth previously in Mayo
4

CBM2015-00154
Patent 5,816,918
Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1289
(2012), “for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural
phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent-eligible
applications of these concepts.” Alice, 134 S. Ct. at 2355. The first step in
the analysis is to “determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one
of those patent-ineligible concepts.” Id. If they are directed to a patentineligible concept, the second step in the analysis is to consider the elements
of the claims “individually and ‘as an ordered combination”’ to determine
whether there are additional elements that “‘transform the nature of the
claim’ into a patent-eligible application.” Id. (quoting Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at
1297, 1298,). In other words, the second step is to “search for an ‘inventive
concept’––i.e., an element or combination of elements that is ‘sufficient to
ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent
upon the [ineligible concept] itself.’” Id. (alteration in original)
(quoting Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1294). Further, the “prohibition against
patenting abstract ideas ‘cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the
use of the formula to a particular technological environment’ or adding
‘insignificant postsolution activity.”’ Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 610–
11 (2010) (quoting Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S.175, 191–92 (1981)).
For the first step of the Alice test, Petitioner argues that (1)
independent claim 15 is directed to the abstract idea of “receiving money
from a player, allowing a player to play a game, providing a dynamic set of
prizes to the player based on various factors, and allowing the player to
choose and redeem a prize”; (2) independent claim 1 is directed to the
abstract idea of “providing a list of prizes to game players, where the cost of
each prize is determined based on the number of credits and desired
5

CBM2015-00154
Patent 5,816,918
profitability of the apparatus”; (3) independent claim 21 is directed to the
abstract idea of “providing prizes for a game, where the cost of the prizes is
determined based on the desired payout and profitability of the game”; (4)
independent claims 34, 38, and 45 are directed to the abstract idea of
“providing a tournament for a game of skill over a network” and “providing
a menu for presenting and selecting prizes based on prize credits”; (5)
independent claim 39 is directed to the abstract idea of “providing a
tournament game”; (6) independent claim 47 is directed to the abstract idea
of “providing a list of prizes to game players, where the cost of each prize is
automatically determined based on the number of credits and desired payout
and profitability of the apparatus”; (7) independent claim 59 is directed to
the abstract idea of “providing a list of prizes to game players, where the
cost of each prize is automatically determined based on the number of
credits and desired payout and profitability of the apparatus”; and (8)
independent claim 73 is directed to the abstract idea of “providing prizes for
a game, where the cost of the prizes is determined based on the desired
payout.” Pet. 28, 35, 37, 40–41, 42, 44, 46, 48–49. Petitioner additionally
asserts abstract ideas for each of the challenged dependent claims. Id. at 50–
80.
As for the second step of the Alice test, Petitioner contends that any
recited structures are generic, the remaining claim elements are directed to
the abstract idea or well known, or the claims do not recite a technical
solution to a technical problem. Pet. 31–33 (claim 15), 35–36 (claim 1), 37–
39 (claim 21), 41 (claims 34, 38, 45), 42–43 (claim 39), 44–45 (claim 47),
47 (claim 59), 49 (claim 73), 50–80 (dependent claims 2–14, 16–20, 22–33,

6

CBM2015-00154
Patent 5,816,918
46, 48–58, 60–72, 74–77). For example, with respect to claim 15, Petitioner
states
- Element [a] claims the abstract idea of displaying a prize table.
- Element [b] claims the abstract idea of receiving an input of the
prizes available for players of the games, and the ability to
receive money from players, both of which the ‘918 Patent
admits were commonly known and which are computer
implementations of previously-manual processes.
- Element [c] claims the abstract idea of receiving payout input
from the operator, which is expressed in terms of the monetary
value of the prizes versus the amount of money received.
- Element [d] claims the abstract idea of determining cost of each
prize in accordance with the desired payout and profitability.
- Element [e] claims the abstract idea of receiving monetary
input.
- Element [f] claims the abstract idea of implementing the game
process and providing a player with a score.
- Element [g] claims the abstract idea of displaying a prize
selection screen with a plurality of prizes and a prize cost (i.e., a
price list).
- Element [h] claims the abstract idea of the player selecting a
prize that has a cost less than the number of credits the player
has.
- Element [i] claims the abstract idea of the player receiving a
redemption coupon or other indication for redeeming a prize.
Id. at 32–33.
Petitioner fails to provide a credible analysis considering the elements
of the challenged claims “individually and ‘as an ordered combination”’ to
determine whether the additional elements transform the nature of the
challenged claims into a patent-eligible application in accordance with the
second step of the Alice analysis. The Petition fails to provide a credible and
sufficient explanation as to whether an element or combination of elements
is sufficient to ensure that the ’918 patent in practice amounts to
7

CBM2015-00154
Patent 5,816,918
significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself. The
Petition, instead, asserts cursory and conclusory arguments with no or
insufficient evidence that the additional claim elements are well known or
recite generic structure. See Pet. 31–80. Petitioner’s failure to do a full
analysis under Alice constitutes a breach of 37 C.F.R. § 42.304(b)(4), as well
as 35 U.S.C. § 322(a)(3), which requires identifying the grounds “with
particularity.”

III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we determine that the information in the

Petition does not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that claims 1–34,
38, 39, and 45–77 of the ’918 patent are unpatentable in the sole challenge
under 35 U.S.C. § 101.

IV.

ORDER
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Petition is denied for the

reasons discussed, and no trial is instituted.
