I.

INTRODUCTION
On January 15, 2016, we instituted an inter partes review of claims 1–14 of

U.S. Patent No. 5,594,936. Paper 8.
Patent Owner sought permission to file, and then filed, a “Request for
Adverse Judgment” on February 6, 2016. Paper 10. The request, made pursuant to
37 C.F.R. § 42.73(b)(4), states “Patent Owner hereby abandons the contest, and
requests adverse judgment.” Id. No opposition has been filed by Petitioner.
II.

DISCUSSION
A party may request judgment against itself at any time during a proceeding.

37 C.F.R. § 42.73(b). Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 42.73(b)(4), “[a]bandonment of the
contest” is construed as a request for adverse judgment. Here, Patent Owner has
abandoned the contest as to all claims subject to trial in this proceeding and
requested adverse judgment. Paper 10. Under these circumstances, entry of
judgment adverse to the Patent Owner and cancellation of claims 1–14 is
appropriate.
III.

ORDER
Accordingly, it is:
ORDERED that Patent Owner’s Request for Adverse Judgment under 37

C.F.R. § 42.73(b) with respect to claims 1–14 of U.S. Patent No. 5,594,936 is
granted;
FURTHER ORDERED that judgment is herein entered against Patent
Owner with respect to claims 1−14 of Patent 5,594,936;
FURTHER ORDERED that this constitutes a final written decision under
35 U.S.C. § 328(a); and
FURTHER ORDERED that claims 1–14 of U.S. Patent No. 5,594,936 be
canceled.
