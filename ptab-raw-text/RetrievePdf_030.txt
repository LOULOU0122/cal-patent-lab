JUDGMENT
Termination of the Proceeding
35 U.S.C. § 317 and 37 C.F.R. § 42.72
After obtaining Board authorization, on December 16, 2015, the
parties filed a “Joint Motion to Terminate Proceeding Pursuant to 35 U.S.C.
§ 317 and 37 C.F.R. §§ 42.72 and 42.74.” Paper 16. The parties also filed
therewith a true copy of the written settlement agreement (Ex. 2001), and a
“Joint Request to Treat the Settlement Agreement as Business Confidential

IPR2015-00558
Patent 5,682,750
Information and Kept Separate Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 317(b) and 37 C.F.R.
§ 42.74(c).” Paper 17.
The parties indicate that they have “they have settled their dispute,”
and that the settlement “resolves all related matters,” which includes this
proceeding, a related district court proceeding and a related arbitration.
Paper 16, 1. The inter partes proceeding is still at an early stage, as neither
party has filed any substantive papers subsequent to the Decision on
Institution. Based on the facts of the case, we are persuaded that it is
appropriate to terminate the proceeding as to both Petitioner and Patent
Owner. Therefore, the joint motion to terminate and the request to file the
settlement agreement as business confidential information are granted.

Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that the joint motion to terminate the proceeding is
granted;
FURTHER ORDERED that the joint request to file the settlement
agreement as business confidential information, to be kept separate from the
patent file, is granted; and
FURTHER ORDERED that the proceeding is terminated.
