ORDER
Dismissing the Petitions
37 C.F.R. §§ 42.5(a), 42.71(a)
On August 14, 2015, pursuant to Board authorization, Petitioner
Samsung Techwin America and Patent Owner Trover Group, Inc. filed Joint
Motions to Terminate these related proceedings. IPR2015-01296, Paper 10;

IPR2015-01296 (Patent No. 5,751,346)
IPR2015-01298 (Patent No. 5,751,345)
IPR2015-01298, Paper 7; (collectively, “Mot.”). With the Joint Motions, the
parties filed copies of a written settlement agreement between them, and
Joint Requests to Keep Separate, seeking to have the settlement agreement
treated as confidential business information under 35 U.S.C. § 317(b) and 37
C.F.R. § 42.74(c). IPR2015-01296, Ex. 1011, Paper 11; IPR2015-01298,
Ex. 1010, Paper 8.
These proceedings are in their initial stages; the Board has not yet
decided the merits of the Petitions. The parties indicate that they have
agreed to resolve their dispute related to the challenged patents. Mot. 1.
Under these circumstances, we determine that it is appropriate to dismiss the
petitions and decline to institute trial. See 35 U.S.C. § 314; 37 C.F.R.
§§ 42.5(a), 42.71(a). This paper does not constitute a final written decision
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a).

In light of the foregoing, it is
ORDERED that the Joint Motions to Terminate (IPR2015-01296,
Paper 10; IPR2015-01298, Paper 7) are granted;
FURTHER ORDERED that the Petitions (IPR2015-01296, Paper 2;
IPR2015-01298, Paper 2) are dismissed;
FURTHER ORDERED that no trial is instituted; and
FURTHER ORDERED that the parties’ Joint Requests (IPR201501296, Paper 11; IPR2015-01298, Paper 8) to have their settlement
agreement (IPR2015-01296, Ex. 1011; IPR2015-01298, Ex. 1010) treated as
business confidential information, to be kept separate from the patent file,
are granted.
