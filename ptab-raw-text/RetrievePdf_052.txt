INTRODUCTION
A.

Background

EMC Corporation, EMC International U.S. Holdings, Inc., and
VMware, Inc., (collectively, “Petitioner”) filed a Petition requesting inter
partes review of claims 1–8 of U.S. Patent 5,825,891 (Ex. 1001, “the ’891
patent”) pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §§ 311–319. Paper 1 (“Pet.”). Clouding
Corp. (“Patent Owner”) filed a Preliminary Response. Paper 11. On
January 26, 2015, we instituted an inter partes review of claims 1–8 on
certain grounds of unpatentability alleged in the Petition. Paper 12 (“Dec.”).
After institution of trial, Patent Owner filed a Patent Owner Response (Paper
25; “PO Resp.”) and Petitioner filed a Reply (Paper 29; “Reply”). An oral
hearing was held on August 17, 2015. A transcript of the hearing has been
entered into the record. Paper 39 (“Tr.”).
The Board has jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c). In this Final
Written Decision, issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R.
§ 42.73, we determine that Petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the
evidence that all claims for which trial is instituted, namely, claims 1–8, are
unpatentable.
B.

ANALYSIS
Claim Construction

The Board interprets claims in an unexpired patent using the broadest
reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which
they appear. 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b); In re Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC, 793
F.3d 1268, 1277–79 (Fed. Cir. 2015), reh’g en banc denied, 2015 WL
4100060 (Fed. Cir. July 8, 2015) (“We conclude that Congress implicitly
approved the broadest reasonable interpretation standard in enacting the
AIA.”). Under that construction, claim terms are given their ordinary and
customary meaning, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the
art in the context of the entire patent disclosure. In re Translogic Tech., Inc.,
504 F.3d 1249, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Claim terms generally are given their
ordinary and customary meaning, unless it appears from the specification or

4

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
the file history that they were used differently by the inventor, in a clear,
deliberate, and precise manner. In re Paulsen, 30 F.3d 1475, 1480 (Fed. Cir.
1994).
In the Decision to Institute, we construed the terms “temporary
configuration password,” “authenticating,” “tunnel record,” and “tunnel
record information.” Dec. 6–12. As is pertinent to our discussion below, we
construed “authenticating” as “a process which validates a computer or
user.” Id. at 11.
Patent Owner does not dispute the Board’s claim construction nor
advance an alternative construction. Petitioner argues that Patent Owner’s
expert recites the Board’s constructions and affirms that he is applying them.
Reply 3–4. Accordingly, Petitioner urges, the Board should adopt its earlier
constructions in its final determination. Id. at 4. Based on considering anew
the complete record now before us, we see no reason to alter our earlier
constructions, and maintain the constructions for this Final Written Decision.
We see no need to construe expressly any other claim limitations.
B.

Claims 1–5 as Obvious over Aziz and
Kaufman and Aziz and Weiss

Petitioner contends that claims 1–5 would have been obvious over
Aziz and Kaufman and over Aziz and Weiss. Pet. 46–54. Patent Owner
disagrees. PO Resp. 7–20.
1.

Aziz (Ex. 1005)

Aziz describes a method to perform secure tunneling for encrypting
data packets between computers. Ex. 1005, 1:5–11, 6:3–15. According to
Aziz, there are several security advantages to tunneling—a technique that
encrypts the entire original Internet Protocol (IP) packet, rather than only the

5

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
data portion of the IP packet. Id. Notably, Aziz explains that tunneling
prevents the topology and the number of nodes in the private network from
being discovered by a hacker. Id. When transmitting an IP packet using
tunneling, all an unintended observer can determine is that there are a certain
number of firewalls that communicate with each other, and no information,
either as to which nodes in the private network are communicating on an
end-to-end basis or as to the number of nodes that exist in the private
network, is revealed to unintended observers. Id.
Aziz further describes several network schemes that utilize its
invention. For instance, Figure 2 of Aziz, reproduced below, illustrates
Internet 20 coupled to private network 22 through a firewall server FWA:

Figure 2 of Aziz diagrammatically illustrates one possible network
scheme using the teachings of the invention in an Internet environment. Ex.
1005, 2:54–56. As shown in Figure 2 of Aziz, each private network (22, 26,
and 30) is coupled to Internet 20 through a firewall server (FWA, FWC, and
FWB, respectively). Id. at 4:65–5:16. The firewall servers are IP server
computers, which encrypt and decrypt data packets or datagrams sent and

6

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
received to nodes on the private networks over Internet 20. For example,
when node I on private network 22 sends a packet to node J on private
network 30, firewall server FWA first determines that node J is coupled to
network 30, and that firewall server FWB serves network 30. Id. at 5:54–
6:2. Then, firewall server FWA encapsulates the original IP data packet
(header and data) and transmits the data packet in an encrypted IP packet
intended for remote firewall FWB. Id.
In another embodiment, Aziz describes a portable computer that
connects to a public network where the computer is assigned an IP address
dynamically. Ex. 1005, 10:37–11:53, Fig. 8. In that situation, Aziz utilizes
a tunneling scheme in which the cryptographic credentials are associated
with the inner IP address. Id.
2.

Kaufman (Ex. 1007)

Kaufman describes a network authentication scheme, specifically a
technique for distributing keys in a secure manner. Ex. 1007, 266–269.1
Figure 10-1 of Kaufman, reproduced below, illustrates Kaufman’s key
distribution technique (Ex. 1007, 269):

The page numbers in our citation to Kaufman are the original page
numbers in the textbook, on the top right and left corners of each page.
7

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
Figure 10-1 illustrates Kaufman’s described process of “Obtaining a TGT.”
Id. at 269. As shown in Figure 10-1 of Kaufman, Alice (a user) logs into the
workstation by entering her name and password. Id. at 266. To minimize
security risk, the workstation asks the server (Key Distribution Center
(KDC)) for a session key S A for Alice to use for just this one session. Id.
Kaufman’s system derives Alice’s master key from her password. Id. The
KDC generates a session key S A and transmits S A (encrypted with Alice’s
master key) to the workstation. Id. The KDC also sends a ticket-granting
ticket (TGT), which is S A (and other information, such as Alice’s name and
the TGT’s expiration time) encrypted with the KDC’s master key. Id. The
workstation uses Alice’s master key (derived from her password) to decrypt
the encrypted S A . Id. at 267. After that, the workstation forgets Alice’s
password and only remembers S A and the TGT. Id. When Alice later needs
to access a remote resource, her workstation transmits the TGT, which
includes S A , to KDC, along with the name of the resource to which Alice
needs a ticket. Id.
3.

Weiss (Ex. 1009)

Weiss describes a method for distributing encryption key codes from a
central data site to remote access units. Ex. 1009, 1:1–5. Weiss describes a
randomly generated source number that is used to generate a master key
digital code number. Id. at 17:13–15. The master key code may be used to
transfer additional keys securely over an insecure channel connecting the
computers. Id. at 39:27–40:7. The random source numbers are destroyed to
prevent discovery through re-computation of the master key codes. Id. at
20:3–9, 23:2–9.

Analysis

After considering the Petition, Patent Owner Response, Reply, and all
evidence relied on by Petitioner and Patent Owner, we are persuaded that
Petitioner has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 1–5
would have been obvious over Aziz and Kaufman and over Aziz and Weiss.
The Petition sufficiently accounts for each of the elements in these claims
and provides well-supported reasons to combine the prior art teachings to
satisfy the claim elements.
Patent Owner challenges Petitioner’s contention that Aziz’s “firewallto-firewall” communication scheme can be modified using the Kerberos key
exchange technique described by Kaufman. PO Resp. 9–10. Specifically,
Patent Owner argues Aziz seeks to avoid, and counsels readers against, the
type of key exchange taught by Kaufman. Id. at 11. Patent Owner also
challenges Dr. Reynolds’s statement that one of ordinary skill in the art
would have recognized the advantages of using a private key to encrypt
communications as described by Kaufman in place of the public key
encryption described in Aziz because it involves a key that is smaller in size,
a key that takes less computational effort in the encryption/decryption
process, and a key that eliminates the need for public maintenance. Id.
Patent Owner maintains that Dr. Reynolds “fails to convincingly explain
why any person of ordinary skill in the art would employ such keys in a
system as taught by Aziz.” Id. at 12. Patent Owner summarizes that “[o]ur
argument is that the combination that the Petitioners have proposed is not a
combination that would be made and, therefore, the obviousness argument is
not a legally sound argument.” Tr. 61:17–20.

9

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
Petitioner argues, first, that Patent Owner does not dispute that the
prior art teaches all the elements of claims 1–5. Reply 4–5; Tr. 10:17–19.
Petitioner argues, next, that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have
combined the teachings of Aziz and Kaufman, or Aziz and Weiss, because
they all relate to techniques for secure computer communications, and teach
key distribution techniques. Reply 6 (citing Ex. 1028 ¶¶ 9–18). Petitioner
relies on the testimony of Dr. Reynolds, who opines that there are numerous
advantages to be had by using a private key, as in Kaufman and Weiss, in
place of the public key encryption described in Aziz:
[S]ome advantages of using a private key over a public key
include a key that is smaller in size, a key that takes less
computational effort to encrypt, and a key that eliminates the
need for public maintenance.
Ex. 1020 ¶¶ 54, 68; Ex. 1028 ¶¶ 12–14. Dr. Reynolds further explains that
making such combinations would not have been beyond the skill level of
one of ordinary skill in the art, and would not yield more than predictable
results. Ex. 1028 ¶ 10. Petitioner argues that even Patent Owner’s expert
confirmed that one of ordinary skill in the art would have been familiar with
private key schemes, public key schemes, and their relative advantages.
Reply 9–10. In sum, Petitioner argues that “one of ordinary skill in the art
would have been motivated to replace the public key encryption described in
Aziz with the private key technique described in Kaufman and Weiss,
especially if, in a particular network, the need for encryption/decryption
performance outweighed the advantage of public keys.” Id. at 11.
As noted by Petitioner, there is no dispute on the claim construction,
and there is no dispute that the combination of Aziz and Kaufman or Aziz
and Weiss meets every element of claims 1 through 5. Reply 1; Tr. 10:15–
10

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
19. Thus, the dispute regarding claims 1–5 reduces to whether one of
ordinary skill in the art would have combined the necessary elements of
Aziz with Kaufman or Weiss to yield the claimed subject matter. In this
regard, we are persuaded by Petitioner’s arguments that one of ordinary skill
in the art would have combined Aziz with Kaufman or Weiss to arrive at the
claimed invention.
Preliminarily, Petitioner argues that the claims themselves “don’t
require either public or private key approaches. They are agnostic on that.”
Tr. 13:10–11. We agree with Petitioner that the claims do not require or
prohibit use of one or the other of a private key or a public key approach.
Aziz, in its teaching of a method to perform secure tunneling for encrypting
data packets between computers, discusses use of a key management scheme
to encrypt those data packets, i.e., the “public key” technique referred to by
Petitioner. Ex. 1005, 1:5–11; 6:16–40; Ex. 1020 ¶ 49.
Regarding the combination of Aziz’s methods with the “private key”
technique of Kaufman and Weiss, we credit the testimony of Petitioner’s
expert, Dr. Reynolds, that using a private key technique, as in Kaufman and
Weiss, in place of a public key technique would have had advantages known
to those of ordinary skill in the art. Ex. 1020, ¶¶ 54, 68; Ex. 1028 ¶¶ 12–14.
Patent Owner’s expert, Dr. Nettles, agreed that “there are advantages and
disadvantages to public- and secret-key encryption schemes” and that they
would have been understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art at the
time of the ’891 patent. Ex. 1027, 34:5–15, 42:11–16; Tr. 19:1–9, 21:18–24.
Patent Owner’s expert also agreed that, in general, at the time of the ’891
patent, “a person of ordinary skill in the art could have implemented a
system using either public-key or private-key techniques.” Id. at 41:15–20.

11

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
Accepting that one of ordinary skill in the art would have known of the
relative advantages of the public-key and private-key techniques, and how to
implement a system using either technique, it follows that one of ordinary
skill in the art would have known to use in the system of Aziz the privatekey technique of Kaufman and/or Weiss to obtain the benefits of using a
private-key technique.
We also agree with Petitioner’s argument that replacing a public key
with a private key would have been an alternative technique known to one of
ordinary skill in the art. Reply 11; Ex. 1028 ¶ 14; Tr. passim. Petitioner’s
expert opined that, depending on the relative needs of the particular network
— either security and efficiency, or allowing encrypted communication
between parties that do not already share a secret — a person of ordinary
skill in the art would have been motivated to choose either a public key or a
private key system design. Ex. 1028 ¶ 14; Tr. 72:17–73:2. Patent Owner’s
expert did not counter that the combination of Aziz and Kaufman would
yield unpredictable results. Ex. 1027, 63:2–18. Aziz does not, based on the
information before us, prohibit a design that includes a private key
arrangement. We note that Aziz itself teaches that its system could be used
in other network arrangements. Ex. 1005, 5:11–16; 10:37–11:53; 11:55–
12:11. Petitioner’s expert opines that this teaching in Aziz would have
motivated a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the teachings of
Aziz with either Kaufman or Weiss. Ex. 1028 ¶ 15. Given that one of
ordinary skill in the art would have known about the relative advantages of
the public-key and private-key techniques, and also of situations in which
one might be preferred over the other, we agree with Petitioner that one of

12

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine Aziz with
Kaufman and/or Weiss.
Patent Owner does not argue persuasively to the contrary. Although
Patent Owner argues that Aziz seeks to avoid, and counsels readers against,
the type of key exchange taught by Kaufman, Patent Owner does not
reconcile this with Aziz’s statement that Aziz’s system could be used in
other network arrangements. Nor does Patent Owner’s expert provide
adequate reasoning to counter Petitioner’s assertion that one of ordinary skill
in the art would have used a private key exchange in the system of Aziz.
Patent Owner relies on assertions made by its expert that, in Kaufman
and Weiss, both computers would need to be operational to exchange private
key information successfully. PO Resp. 10; Ex. 2002 ¶¶ 18, 24. Petitioner
explains, persuasively, how neither Kaufman nor Weiss actually requires
that both computers would need to be operational in order to exchange
private key information successfully. Tr. 15:21–16:18; 16:24–17:11; Ex.
1028 ¶ 16. Patent Owner also argues that Aziz prefers use of DH public key
certificates over other methods. PO Resp. 8. This section of Aziz expresses
a preferred embodiment and does not preclude or advocate affirmatively
against using other methods. Additionally, as explained by Petitioner’s
expert, this section contrasts DH public key certificate methods with other
public key certificate methods such as RSA; it does not contrast DH public
key certificate methods with private key methods. Ex. 1028 ¶ 17.
Given the totality of the arguments, one of ordinary skill in the art
would have known that the design of the Aziz system could have been
modified to include a private key system to encrypt communications, and
would have been motivated to do so to capitalize upon the advantages of the

13

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
private key system. Upon review of the complete record, we find that
Petitioner has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 1
is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious over Aziz and Weiss
and over Aziz and Kaufman.
We have reviewed the arguments presented in the Petition and the
supporting evidence regarding the obviousness of claims 2–5, the substance
of which was not disputed by Patent Owner in its Response. Patent Owner,
in its Response, relies solely on its arguments and evidence concerning
claim 1. See generally PO Resp. In the Scheduling Order, we cautioned
Patent Owner that any arguments for patentability not raised in the Response
would be deemed waived. Paper 13, 3. In sum, we find a preponderance of
the evidence establishes that claims 1–5 would have been obvious in view of
Aziz and Kaufman, and in view of Aziz and Weiss.
C.

Claims 6–8 as Obvious over Aziz and
Rodwin

Petitioner contends that claims 6–8 would have been obvious over
Aziz and Rodwin. Pet. 54–57. Patent Owner disagrees. PO Resp. 20–24.
1.

Rodwin (Ex. 1008)

Rodwin describes a method for providing a remote computer with
access to a local computer network. Ex. 1008, Abs. More precisely,
Rodwin describes using a remote access system to authenticate a remote
user, and to provide an IP address to the remote user from a dynamic IP
address assignment and management server. Id. Figure 1A of Rodwin
illustrates a remote access system, and is reproduced below:

14

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891

Figure 1A of Rodwin shows a simplified diagram of a remote access
system in which a remote access device according to the invention provides
a remote user at a remote computer with access to a local computer network.
Ex. 1008, 4:18–21. As shown in Figure 1A, remote user 18 (e.g., a
telecommuter) initiates an attempt to gain access to network 14 and the
network services and resources available thereon, via remote access device
16 by entering username 20 into remote computer 12. Id. at 1:15–35, 4:48–
52. Username 20 is sent to remote access device 16 through communication
link 22. Id. at 4:57–63. Remote access device 16 authenticates the remote
user before the remote user is granted access to the network and network
services. Id. at 5:16–20. Remote access device 16 also passes an identifier,
which includes username 20, over network 14 to dynamic IP address
assignment/management server 30. Id. at 5:20–23. Server 30 dynamically
assigns IP addresses based on the username. Id. at Abs., 5:26–31. The IP
address, which uniquely identifies the remote computer on the network, is
needed by the remote computer to communicate on the network and access
the network services and resources available thereon. Id.

Analysis

After considering the Petition, Patent Owner Response, Reply, and all
evidence relied on by Petitioner and Patent Owner, we are persuaded that
Petitioner has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 6–8
would have been obvious over Aziz and Rodwin. The Petition sufficiently
accounts for each of the elements in these claims and provides wellsupported reasons to combine the prior art teachings to satisfy the claim
elements.
Notwithstanding that Rodwin does not describe a tunneling technique
to encrypt network packets expressly, Petitioner asserts that claims 6–8 are
unpatentable because such a technique was known in the art as evidenced by
Aziz, and that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have utilized
Rodwin’s authentication approach in the firewall tunneling system of Aziz
to authenticate a remote user and assign a dynamic IP address to such a user.
Pet. 21–22. Indeed, Aziz describes a method for performing secure
tunneling for encrypting data packets between computers and the advantages
of utilizing such a method of tunneling, such as preventing hackers from
discovering the data and information regarding the private network. Ex.
1005, 1:5–11, 6:3–15.
Patent Owner argues that, although Petitioner relies on Rodwin’s user
authentication to teach the “authenticating the first computer” limitation
recited in claim 6, “[n]owhere, however, does Petitioner explain how
authenticating a user (as taught by Rodwin) is equivalent to authenticating a
computer.” PO Resp. 20. Specifically, Patent Owner argues that Rodwin
explains why usernames and passwords are an insufficient basis upon which
to authenticate computers. Id. at 21. Patent Owner summarizes that “it is

16

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
clear that while the usernames authenticate users, inasmuch as the
usernames are portable across devices . . . they do not authenticate
computers.” Id.
Regarding the combination of Aziz and Rodwin, Patent Owner argues
that Petitioner offers no compelling reasons why a person of ordinary skill in
the art would ever make the combination of Aziz and Rodwin. Id. at 23.
Patent Owner challenges Dr. Reynolds’s statement that “the system taught
by Aziz would likely have been implemented in a manner that included
authentication as recited in the claims,” arguing that Aziz teaches a specific
methodology for authenticating users, depending on whether the user has a
known IP address or a dynamically assigned IP address. . Id. at 23 (citing
Ex. 1020 ¶ 79). Patent Owner maintains that Dr. Reynolds “never explains
why such a combination [of Aziz and Rodwin] would ever be made.” Id. at
24.
Petitioner argues that Patent Owner’s Response presents no arguments
apart from attorney argument already rejected by the Board. Reply 13.
According to Petitioner, Patent Owner’s argument fails in that (1)
authenticating users is within the Board’s construction of “authenticating”;
and (2) Patent Owner provides no evidence to support its argument. Id. at
15. Dr. Reynolds opines that in certain network arrangements,
authenticating a user validates the computer. Id. at 16 (citing Ex. 1028 ¶¶
25–27); Tr. 35:17–36:7. Moreover, Dr. Nettles admits that a computer’s
MAC address, such as Rodwin’s “MAC+index” mode, could be used to
authenticate the computer. Reply 17; Tr. 36:17–37:11.
Claim 6 requires the step of “authenticating the first computer.” We
construed the term “authenticating” to mean “a process which validates a

17

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
computer or user.” Dec. 11. Patent Owner does not propose an alternative
construction for “authenticating.” The Specification does not discuss or
define the term “authenticating.”
Initially, we note that based on our construction of “authenticating” —
“authenticating a user or a computer” — authenticating can happen by
authenticating the user, or by authenticating the computer. In this sense,
looking only at the term “authenticating,” Rodwin “authenticates” because it
authenticates the user. Patent Owner does not dispute that Rodwin
authenticates the user. Additionally, our construction does not exclude
authenticating a computer by authenticating its user. Nor, as discussed
below, does Rodwin necessarily fail to authenticate the computer itself.
Nevertheless, we look at our construction of the term “authenticating”
in view of how it appears in claim 6, which recites “authenticating the first
computer.” Even under this approach, however, Rodwin authenticates.
First, Rodwin’s system, which Patent Owner agrees authenticates the
user, is not divorced from the computer used by the user. The process of
authenticating the user can also authenticate the computer. Reply 16 (citing
Ex. 1028 ¶¶ 19–27). Petitioner’s expert opines that a person of ordinary
skill in the art “would know that authenticating a computer and
authenticating a user are interlaced concepts.” Ex. 1028 ¶ 25. In the ’891
patent, for example, Figure 11 describes the process of the user’s computer
accessing the internet. Ex. 1001, 6:38–52. Step 194 of Figure 11 states “Id
User Computer and Prompt for User Name and Password.” Ex. 1001, Fig.
11. Referencing Figure 11, the specification provides: “The firewall
computer identifies (step 194) the computer and may prompt the user for a
user name and a user password. If the user name and password are

18

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
authorized (step 196), the firewall updates (step 198) the tunnel records with
the internet address sent as part of the connect request.” Id. at 6:45–50
(emphasis added). Petitioner’s expert also opines that “computers are often
authenticated by implication: authenticating the user meant the computer
was authenticated and trusted also.” Ex. 1028 ¶ 25. We credit this
testimony; we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that the
process of authenticating Rodwin’s user excludes authenticating the
computer being used by the user.
Second, Petitioner argues that the MAC+index mode of Rodwin can
be used to authenticate the computer. Reply 16–17 (citing Ex. 1028 ¶¶ 28–
34). Petitioner argues that this point, raised for the first time in its Reply
Brief, is properly responsive to Patent Owner’s arguments regarding the
teachings of Rodwin. Tr. 44:17–45:7. We agree. Patent Owner argues in
its Response that Rodwin authenticates users, using usernames, but that
Rodwin’s usernames do not authenticate computers. PO Resp. 20–22. Both
Patent Owner’s expert and Petitioner’s expert weighed in on this argument.
Ex. 1027, 85:9–16; Ex. 1028 ¶¶ 25–34. Patent Owner addressed the
MAC+index approach in its Motion for Observations on Cross-Examination.
Paper 35, 4. Patent Owner also discussed the MAC address issue at oral
hearing, agreeing that a “MAC address will authenticate a computer” while
maintaining the position that “MAC addresses simply are not sufficient.”
Tr. 64:24–66:15. Thus, we consider this argument as properly before us.
Regarding the merits of this argument, we are persuaded that Rodwin
“authenticates” computers through use of their MAC address. Rodwin, like
Aziz, has a DHCP server that assigns IP addresses to computers. Ex. 1008,
10:4–12. Rodwin provides that it is desirable that each remote computer “be

19

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
uniquely and deterministically identifiable by the dynamic IP address
assignment/management server(s).” Id. at 2:39–40. The MAC+index mode
of Rodwin identifies a mode of operation of the remote access device in
which the reconnection feature does not work but username sharing is
allowed. Id. at 9:13–16. Petitioner’s expert opines that one of ordinary skill
in the art would have been aware of the automated use of addresses such as
MAC addresses as a method for automatically authenticating a computer.
Ex. 1028 ¶¶ 31 (citing Ex. 1007, 183), 33. Patent Owner’s expert agrees that
a DHCP server “could use the computer’s MAC address, determine whether
that MAC address is on an approved list of computers and, if it is on that
approved list of computers, to return an IP address.” Reply 17 (citing Ex.
1027, 85:9–16). Rodwin, in addition to authenticating a user, also provides
for authenticating a computer.
Regarding the combination of Aziz and Rodwin, Petitioner argues that
a person of ordinary skill in the art “would have combined Aziz with
Rodwin, using Rodwin’s authentication approach to create a new firewallto-firewall tunnel as taught in Aziz.” Pet. 21. Petitioner further explains
that Rodwin’s “remote access point could readily and predictably have been
coupled to the Aziz firewall to provide multiple users of the single remote
access point the enhanced security of the Aziz firewall-to-firewall tunneling
scheme.” Id. at 21–22 (citing Ex. 1020 ¶¶ 79–80). Dr. Reynolds testifies
that, in the combined system, the remote access device of Rodwin would
support remote users with changing IP addresses and Aziz’s tunnel would
provide secure communication between the remote users and the network
served by the remote access device. Ex. 1020 ¶ 80. We also credit the
testimony of Dr. Reynolds that combining the teachings of Aziz and Rodwin

20

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
would not have been beyond the skill level of one of ordinary skill in the art,
and would have yielded nothing more than predictable results. Ex. 1028 ¶¶
19–23.
Patent Owner’s argument, which focuses narrowly on an exemplary
network of Aziz that utilizes two firewall servers on two different networks
(FWX and FWY), does not account for Aziz’s disclosure that its tunneling
technique may be implemented in different network configurations. See Ex.
1005, Fig. 8. Rodwin’s network configuration involves only one network
and the server is connected to that network (item 14 of Figure 1A of
Rodwin, reproduced above). Notwithstanding paragraph 32 of its expert’s
declaration (Ex. 2002), Patent Owner provides no persuasive explanation as
to why a person of ordinary skill in the art could not have applied Aziz’s
tunneling technique to a communication between a remote computer and a
local network as disclosed in Rodwin, given all of the stated security
advantages of the tunneling technique and teachings of exemplary
implementations in Aziz.
Upon review of the complete record, we find that Petitioner has
established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claim 6 is unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious over Aziz and Rodwin. We have
reviewed the arguments presented in the Petition and the supporting
evidence regarding the obviousness of claims 7 and 8, the substance of
which was not disputed by Patent Owner in its Response. Patent Owner, in
its Response, relies solely on its arguments and evidence concerning claim 6.
See generally PO Resp. In the Scheduling Order, we cautioned Patent
Owner that any arguments for patentability not raised in the Response would
be deemed waived. Paper 13, 3. In sum, we find a preponderance of the

21

IPR2014-01216
Patent 5,825,891
evidence establishes that claims 6–8 would have been obvious in view of
Aziz and Rodwin.
D.

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, after considering the Petition, Patent
Owner Response, Reply, and all evidence relied upon by Petitioner and
Patent Owner, we are persuaded that Petitioner has shown, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that claims 1–5 would have been obvious
over Aziz and Kaufman and over Aziz and Weiss, and that claims 6–8
would have been obvious over Aziz and Rodwin.
III.

ORDER

In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby:
ORDERED that claims 1–8 of the ’891 patent are held unpatentable;
and
FURTHER ORDERED that because this is a final written decision,
parties to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must
comply with the notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
