FINAL WRITTEN DECISION
Inter Partes Review
35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73
I. INTRODUCTION
Petitioner, Universal Remote Control, Inc., filed a Petition requesting
an inter partes review of claims 1, 9, 10, and 14–17 of U.S. Patent No.
5,414,761 (Ex. 1001, “the ’761 patent”) under 35 U.S.C. §§ 311–319. Paper

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
1 (“Petition” or “Pet.”). Patent Owner, Universal Electronics, Inc., filed a
Preliminary Response. Paper 8 (“Prelim. Resp.”). Upon consideration of
the Petition and Preliminary Response, on January 6, 2015, we instituted an
inter partes review of claims 1, 9, 10, and 14–17 on one ground of
unpatentability, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 314. Paper 9 (“Dec.”).
Subsequent to institution, Patent Owner filed a Patent Owner
Response in both unredacted (confidential) and revised redacted forms
(Papers 14 and 44 (“PO Resp.”)), along with a Motion to Seal (Paper 15).
Petitioner filed a Reply in both unredacted (confidential) and revised
redacted forms (Papers 21 and 45 (“Pet. Reply”)), along with a Motion to
Seal (Paper 22).
Petitioner filed a Motion to Exclude (Paper 28; “Pet. Mot. to
Exclude”) certain portions of Exhibits 1053 and 1054. Patent Owner filed
an Opposition to the Motion to Exclude (Paper 35; “PO Exclude Opp.”), and
Petitioner filed a Reply (Paper 37; “Pet. Exclude Reply”).
Patent Owner filed a Motion to Exclude (Paper 29; “PO Mot. to
Exclude”) Exhibit 1043, and portions of Petitioner’s Reply that rely on
Exhibit 1043. Petitioner filed an Opposition to the Motion to Exclude
(Paper 33; “Pet. Exclude Opp.”), and Patent Owner filed a Reply (Paper 36;
“PO Exclude Reply”). Patent Owner filed a Motion for Observations (Paper
30) and Petitioner filed a Response to the Observations (Paper 34).
An oral hearing was held on August 19, 2015, and a transcript of the
hearing is included in the record (Paper 47; “Tr.”).
The Board has jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c). This Final Written
Decision is issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73.

Patent 5,414,761
For the reasons that follow, we determine that Petitioner has shown by
a preponderance of the evidence that claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15 of the ’761
patent are unpatentable. Petitioner, however, has not shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that claims 16 and 17 are unpatentable.
A. Related Proceedings
According to the parties, the ’761 patent is involved in the following
lawsuit: Universal Electronics, Inc. v. Universal Remote Control, Inc., No.
SACV 13-00984 AG (JPRx) (C.D. Cal.). Pet. 1; Paper 4.
B. The ’761 Patent
The ’761 patent relates to a remote control that includes input
circuitry with a set of keys or pushbuttons for inputting commands to the
remote control, infrared signal output circuitry for supplying an infrared
signal to a controlled device, and a central processing unit (CPU) coupled to
the input circuitry. Ex. 1001, Abstract, Fig. 8, Fig. 9B. Memory is coupled
to the CPU, which stores code data for generating infrared light to control an
apparatus. Id. Memory may be updated from outside the remote control
through data coupling circuitry and structure coupled to the CPU. Id.
Figure 20 of the ’761 patent is reproduced below.

Patent 5,414,761

Figure 20 is a fragmentary perspective view of a connector having
conversion circuitry and a battery case cover by which data can be input into
the RAM of the operating circuitry of a remote control device. Ex. 1001,
4:28–33. Signal coupling and converting assembly 206 includes connector
assembly 207, cable 208, and cover plate 210 for battery compartment 45
(Fig. 7). Cover plate 210 has three pins 212, 214, and 216 on its underside,
which are positioned to connect with three serial ports 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 7) of
the remote control device. Id. at 19:43–49. Pins 212, 214, and 216 are
connected by three wire conductors 224, 226, and 228 in cable 208 to
connector assembly 207, which contains conversion circuitry 230.
Conversion circuitry 230 (Figs. 21, 22) enables using some of the nine
sockets 250 of connector assembly 207 for communication with serial ports
1, 2, and 3 via pins 212, 214, and 216. Id. at 19:49–59.

Patent 5,414,761
C. Illustrative Claim
Each of claims 1, 14, 15, 16, and 17 is independent. Claim 1,
reproduced below, is illustrative.
1. A remote control system with data coupling including:
a remote control comprising input means including a set of keys
or pushbuttons for inputting commands into the remote control,
infrared signal output means including IR lamp driver means
for supplying an infrared signal to a controlled device, a central
processing unit (CPU) coupled to the input means and to the
signal output means, memory means coupled to the CPU and
data coupling means including receiving means coupled to the
CPU for enabling at least one of (a) instruction codes or
(b) code data for creating appropriate IR lamp driver
instructions for causing the infrared signal output means to emit
infrared signals which will cause specific functions to occur in a
specific controlled device, for operating a variety of devices to
be controlled, to be supplied from outside the remote control
through the receiving means directly to the CPU for direct entry
to the memory to enable the remote control to control various
devices to be controlled upon the inputting of commands to the
keys of the input means and a data transmission system
including coupling means for coupling the receiving means to a
computer, directly, through a telephone line, through a modem
and a telephone line, or through decoding means and a
television set which receives a television signal containing at
least one of the instruction codes or the code data.
Id. at 22:51–23:9.

D. Ground of Unpatentability
We instituted trial based on the sole ground that claims 1, 9, 10, and
14–17 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) based on Ciarcia1 and
Hastreiter.2
II. ANALYSIS
A. Real Party-in-Interest
Petitioner certifies that Universal Remote Control, Inc. (“URC”) is the
real party-in-interest. Pet. 1. Patent Owner, however, contends that
Petitioner failed to also name Ohsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and/or Ohsung
Electronics U.S.A., Inc. (“Ohsung”), a supplier of products to Petitioner
(URC), as real parties-in-interest and that Petitioner’s failure to do so is fatal
to its Petition. PO Resp. 34–39.3
Section 312(a) of Title 35 of the United States Code provides that a
petition for inter partes review under 35 U.S.C. § 311 may be considered
only if, among other things, the petition identifies all real parties-in-interest.
35 U.S.C. § 312(a)(2). Whether a non-identified party is a real party-ininterest to a proceeding is a highly fact-dependent question. Office Patent
Trial Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg. 48,756, 48,759 (Aug. 14, 2012) (“Trial
Practice Guide”) (citing Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880 (2008)). “A
common consideration is whether the non-party exercised or could have
exercised control over a party’s participation in a proceeding.” Trial
Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg. at 48,759 (citing Taylor, 553 U.S. at 895). The

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
concept of control generally means that “it should be enough the nonparty
has the actual measure of control or opportunity to control that might
reasonably be expected between two formal coparties.” Id.
Patent Owner argues that Ohsung exercised or could have exercised
control over Petitioner’s participation in this proceeding based on the close
relationship between Petitioner and Ohsung. PO Resp. 36. In support of
that argument, Patent Owner first directs us to evidence to support the notion
that Petitioner (URC) and Ohsung share at least one employee. According
to Patent Owner, Mr. Jak You is a “key remote control executive [who]
identifies himself as both an Ohsung and URC employee.” Id. Evidence
that Mr. You first worked for Petitioner (URC), then worked for Ohsung for
demonstrating that Petitioner and Ohsung share employees, dates back to
August 8, 2001 (Ex. 2019), July 16, 2012 (Ex. 2018), and July 30, 2013
(Exhibit 2021). Such evidence, however, does not tend to show that Mr.
You, around the time of filing of Petitioner’s Petition, held himself out as
working for both Ohsung and Petitioner, or that Ohsung and Petitioner
“share employees.” We would want to know the relationship status between
Petitioner and Ohsung around the time Petitioner filed its Petition, as far as
sharing of employees goes.
In any event, and even assuming that URC and Ohsung share an
employee, we do not agree with Patent Owner that such a sharing of one
employee (Mr. You) suggests that Ohsung exercised or could have exercised
control over Petitioner’s participation in the proceeding. For instance, Mr.
You is said to have been a director of engineering for Petitioner. Id. at 36–
37. Patent Owner has not shown that Mr. You was in a position within
Ohsung to persuade Ohsung and/or Petitioner to make a litigation decision to
7

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
pursue an inter partes proceeding.
Moreover, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that
because URC previously paid for office space which an Ohsung employee
(Mr. You) used, this suggests that Ohsung has reciprocated by paying for
anything associated with the proceedings or controlled the proceeding in any
other way. Id. If anything, the evidence tends to show that URC pays for
expenses, such as the costs associated with these proceedings, not Ohsung.
We also have considered Patent Owner’s argument that Ohsung’s and
URC’s close relationship is exemplified by a settlement and license
agreement (Ex. 2050, “agreement”) between Patent Owner and Petitioner, a
provision of which obligates Ohsung to pay royalties to Patent Owner. PO
Resp. 38. Patent Owner argues that the agreement strongly suggests that
Ohsung may have had the opportunity to control, direct, and/or influence the
present proceeding. Id. at 38–39. The agreement was executed in 2004.
The royalties that Patent Owner mentions were paid out in 2005, 2006, and
2007. Patent Owner has not shown how the agreement exemplifies a close
relationship in 2014 when the petition in this proceeding was filed.
Moreover, the agreement and royalties are directed to a set of patents, none
of which is the patent involved in this proceeding. Accordingly, we are not
persuaded by this argument.
Lastly, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s argument that
because URC and Ohsung share litigation counsel in the related case, that
that tends to show that Ohsung has controlled, or had the opportunity to
control, this proceeding. In summary, and based on the totality of arguments
and evidence presented, we are not persuaded that Ohsung is a real party-ininterest on behalf of Petitioner.

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
B. Claim Interpretation
The ’761 patent has expired and, thus, cannot be amended. For claims
of an expired patent, the Board’s claim interpretation is similar to that of a
district court. See In re Rambus, Inc., 694 F.3d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 2012). “In
determining the meaning of the disputed claim limitation, we look
principally to the intrinsic evidence of record, examining the claim language
itself, the written description, and the prosecution history, if in evidence.”
DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 469 F.3d 1005, 1014
(Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312–17
(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc)). However, there is a “heavy presumption” that a
claim term carries its ordinary and customary meaning. CCS Fitness, Inc. v.
Brunswick Corp., 288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
Petitioner proffers constructions for several means-plus-function
terms (Pet. 14–20), and Patent Owner weighs in on those constructions (PO
Resp. 5–22). For purposes of this Final Written Decision, we determine that
those terms do not require express construction. Patent Owner also contends
that Petitioner’s failure to propose a construction for “IR lamp driver
means,” “receiving means,” “decoding means,” “first connector means,” and
“interface connector means” in accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth
paragraph, is fatal to the Petition. PO Resp. 2–3. We agree with Petitioner,
however, that these “means” are part of means-plus-function limitations
which Petitioner did construe. PO Resp. 11.
For this Final Written Decision, we determine that only the terms
“code data” and “instruction codes” require express construction.

9

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
Code Data
Claim 1 recites “code data for creating appropriate IR lamp driver
instructions.” Ex. 1001, 22:61–62. Independent claims 14, 15, 16, and 17
recite similar language. Patent Owner argues that “code data” means
“instructions and timing information for generating an infrared signal.” PO
Resp. 10. Both parties agree that “code data” includes timing information or
data, but the parties disagree that code data also includes instructions.4 Id.;
Pet. Reply 4; Tr. 13, 40, 59. It is necessary for us to construe the phrase
because there is a dispute about whether the prior art (Ciarcia) describes
code data. For example, Patent Owner agrees that Ciarcia describes
supplying from outside the remote control timing data to the remote control,
but disagrees that Ciarcia also describes supplying instructions to the remote
control. PO Resp. 26–28. For the reasons that follow, we determine that
code data includes timing information or data, but need not include
instructions.
We begin with the plain language of claim 1. Claim 1 recites enabling
“at least one of (a) instruction codes or (b) code data for creating appropriate
IR lamp driver instructions.” Based on the words of claim 1, the code data
alone may be used for creating IR lamp driver instructions. Moreover, the
claim requires enabling5 either instruction codes or code data to be supplied
4

Patent Owner refers to instructions as programming (computer
instructions) or computer executable instructions. PO Resp. 27; Ex. 2029
¶ 72; Tr. 66. Patent Owner contrasts instructions with timing information,
which, it submits, is data. PO Resp. 24; Tr. 64.
5
During trial hearing, counsel for Petitioner made arguments that due to the
word “enabling” the claim language does not require that anything be
supplied from outside the remote control, arguments that were not presented
previously. See, e.g., Tr. 87–88. We need not and do not consider
10

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
from outside the remote control. While the remaining independent claims
14, 15, 16, and 17 do not recite the exact same limitation, each of those
claims also recites instruction codes in addition to code data. In its
Response, Patent Owner does not explain how “instruction codes” are
different, if they are at all, from the “instructions” it argues should be
included in the construction of “code data.” The Specification of the ’761
patent uses “instructions” interchangeably with “instruction codes” for
generating, or creating, infrared (IR) codes. See, e.g., Ex. 1001, 9:35–43.
Based on the record before us, we find that instruction and instruction codes
with respect to creating IR lamp driver instructions are synonymous insofar
as the Specification and the claims are concerned. Patent Owner has not
explained otherwise.6
None of the challenged claims define or further explain what “code
data” means. For example, there is nothing in claim 1 that would lead us to
believe that data, albeit code data, should be construed to mean data plus
programming or executable computer instructions. The phrase is “code
data.” Moreover, the challenged claims distinguish between instruction
codes and code data by claiming them both as separate elements. Based on
the plain words of the challenged claims, code data and instruction codes are

Petitioner’s arguments advanced during trial hearing that were not raised
prior to the trial hearing. To do otherwise would be prejudicial to Patent
Owner.
6
In its Reply brief, and during hearing, Petitioner argued that the claim 1
“instruction codes” are synonymous to the “instructions” that Patent Owner
argues is part of “code data.” Pet. Reply 4, 7–8; Tr. 18. Patent Owner had
ample opportunity to explain, during hearing, that “instruction codes” are
different from “instructions” that it argues is part of “code data,” but did not
do so. Tr. 38.
11

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
not the same thing. Yet, Patent Owner’s claim construction would
effectively rewrite the language to remove, for example with respect to
claim 1, the “at least one of . . . or” language. For example, claim 1 covers
choosing both instruction codes and code data, but under Patent Owner’s
construction such scenario would make little sense because code data would
also include instruction codes or instructions.
We next turn to the Specification of the ’761 patent. Patent Owner
focuses on the following passage from the Specification of the ’761 patent in
support of its argument that code data includes instructions:
In the method for learning or acquiring code data for infrared
codes disclosed herein, no counting of pulses is carried out.
Instead the method involves the following steps:
(a) receiving a transmission of a train of pulses from a remote
control transmitter;
(b) recording the point-in-time of an edge of each pulse in a
train of the pulses;
(c) transforming the recorded point-in-time data into a list of
instructions for generating a replica of the train of pulses;
(d) timing the duration of a train of the pulses;
(e) timing the period between trains of pulses;
(f) associating a function key of the universal remote control
device 10 with the time duration of the train of pulses and
the list of instructions for generating a replica of the train
of pulses;
(g) determining whether or not repetitions of the transmission
of train of pulses is present;
(h) ignoring repetitions of the train of pulses;
(i) noting that repetitions are present; and
(j) storing for use in a universal remote control device, the
information acquired in steps (c), (d), (e), (f), and (i).
Ex. 1001, 10:45–68.

12

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
Patent Owner argues that step (c) from above identifies instructions,
and steps (d), (e), (f), and (i) identify timing information. PO Resp. 23.
Patent Owner further argues that Figure 14 and the corresponding text of the
Specification of the ’761 patent confirm that the phrase “code data” is
different from an IR code or signal, and is used to generate the IR code
based on instructions and timing data. Id. (citing Ex. 2029 ¶¶ 62–67). We
have reviewed Mr. Cook’s testimony in support of the proposed
construction. Neither he nor Patent Owner discusses any other passage in
the Specification of the ’761 patent. Rather, his explanation for why we
should construe narrowly “code data” focuses solely on one embodiment of
the Specification. Ex. 2029 ¶¶ 62–67.
There are several other descriptions in the ’761 patent Specification
besides the one above that would indicate to a person of ordinary skill in the
art that code data need not include “instructions.” For example, there are
several passages that describe code data as separate and distinct from
instructions or instruction codes as follows:
Incoming data is received serially from data supply
means, such as from the memory of a personal computer at
serial port 3 and conveyed to input port 112, when it is desired
to update the code data and/or instructions in the RAM 54.
Id. at 9:17–21 (emphasis added).
After the infrared code is deciphered, the code data
therefor and instructions for generating such code (see the flow
chart in FIG. 14) are stored in a programming computer 200
(FIG. 10) and the device 10 is programmed as explained below.
It is to be noted that circuitry 42 has no ROM and all
instruction codes and code data are loaded directly into the
RAM 54. This allows for infinite upgradability in the field via
the serial ports 1, 2, 3.
13

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761

Id. at 9:35–43 (emphasis added).
(6) The multiplexing of the address and data lines
between the RAM 54 and the CPU 56 enables scrambling of the
instruction codes and the code data so that the memory image
in the RAM 54 is encrypted.
Id. at 22:23–27 (emphasis added). In addition, a grandparent patent of the
’761 patent teaches that only the timing information is part of “code data”:
“In learning the infrared code and transforming same to code data . . . , only
the time duration of the pulses . . . as well as the time duration of the pause
between bursts are sensed and used to learn and later to generate the infrared
codes.” Ex. 1011, 1:57–66 (emphasis added).
From the above passages, a person of ordinary skill in the art would
have understood that code data need not include instructions. In other
words, the above passages indicate that “instructions” or instruction codes
are separate from “code data.” If code data necessarily included instructions
or instruction codes, there would be no occasion for the Specification to
refer to instructions or instruction codes separately from code data. Yet, the
Patent Owner Response and the supporting testimony of Mr. Cook (Ex.
2029) are silent with respect to these passages.
Lastly, the Specification of the ’761 patent describes that code data for
the infrared codes “may be obtained from vendor information sheets and
specifications, can be determined using the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,623,887 and 4,626,848, or by the method disclosed herein.” Ex.
1001, 10:39–44. Again, the Patent Owner Response and the supporting
testimony of Mr. Cook (Ex. 2029) are silent with respect to this passage and
14

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
the other ways that code data may be obtained or determined. In summary,
there are many passages in the Specification of the ’761 patent that tend to
support not construing “code data” as Patent Owner would want us to, yet
neither the Patent Owner Response nor the supporting testimony of Mr.
Cook (Ex. 2029) discusses any of those other passages. Rather, Patent
Owner’s arguments and Mr. Cook’s testimony are confined to discussing
only the one embodiment that Patent Owner argues supports the contention
that code data always includes necessarily instructions. For all of the
reasons discussed above, we are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s arguments
that “code data” includes necessarily instructions. Based on the record
before us, “code data” includes timing information or data, but need not
include instructions.
Instruction Codes
As explained above, the record supports the determination that
“instruction codes” is synonymous with “instructions” that Patent Owner
argues is part of code data. Pet. Reply 4, 7–8; Tr. 18, 38. As also explained
above, Patent Owner argues that instructions (instruction codes) are
programming (computer instructions) or computer executable instructions.
PO Resp. 27; Ex. 2029 ¶ 72; Tr. 66. Patent Owner contrasts instructions
with timing information, which, it submits, is data. PO Resp. 24; Tr. 64.
Petitioner argues that code data “refers in general to data” and that
instruction codes requires “instructions.” Pet. Reply 6–7. For purposes of
this Decision, we need not construe the full metes and bounds of “instruction
codes.” Rather, it is sufficient for purposes of this Decision to note that the
claim term “instruction codes” requires instructions and is different from the
claimed term “code data” which includes timing information or data. This is
15

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
particularly evident in independent claims 16 and 17, each of which recites
“instruction codes and code data for creating appropriate IR lamp driver
instructions” as two different elements.
C. Principles of Law
A patent claim is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) if the
differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art are such that
the subject matter, as a whole, would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said
subject matter pertains. KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406
(2007). The question of obviousness is resolved on the basis of underlying
factual determinations including: (1) the scope and content of the prior art;
(2) any differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art;
(3) the level of ordinary skill in the art; and (4) objective evidence of
nonobviousness. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17–18 (1966). In
that regard, an obviousness analysis “need not seek out precise teachings
directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for a court
can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of
ordinary skill in the art would employ.” KSR, 550 U.S. at 418; In re
Translogic Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249, 1262 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The level of
ordinary skill in the art is reflected by the prior art of record. See Okajima v.
Bourdeau, 261 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001); In re GPAC Inc.,
57 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1995); In re Oelrich, 579 F.2d 86, 91 (CCPA
1978).
We analyze the asserted ground of unpatentability in accordance with
the above-stated principles.

16

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
D. Claims 1, 9, 10, and 14–17—Obviousness over Ciarcia and Hastreiter
Petitioner asserts that claims 1, 9, 10, and 14–17 are unpatentable
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious over the combination of Ciarcia and
Hastreiter. Pet. 48–58. In its Petition, Petitioner provides an explanation
how the combination of Ciarcia and Hastreiter collectively meets each claim
limitation of claims 1, 9, 10, and 14–17 and articulates a rationale to
combine the teachings. Id. Petitioner also relies upon a Declaration of
Stephen D. Bristow to support the assertions made in connection with the
Petition. Ex. 1013.
Patent Owner argues that neither Ciarcia nor Hastreiter meets the code
data limitation of all of the involved claims. PO Resp. 26–28. Patent Owner
also argues that there is insufficient reason to combine Ciarcia and
Hastreiter. Id. at 28–30. Lastly, Patent Owner argues that secondary
considerations weigh in favor of the nonobviousness of claims 1, 9, 10, and
14–17. Id. at 30–34. To support its contentions, Patent Owner relies upon
the Declarations of Alex Cook (Ex. 2029) and Ramzi S. Ammari (Ex. 2064).
For the reasons that follow, we determine that Petitioner has shown by
a preponderance of the evidence that claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15 of the ’761
patent are unpatentable, but has not shown by a preponderance of the
evidence that claims 16 and 17 are unpatentable.
Ciarcia
Ciarcia describes a trainable remote control (Master Controller) with a
keypad for inputting commands into the remote control. Ex. 1009, 114.7
The remote control includes a central processing unit (CPU) (Intel 8031

microprocessor, IC1), memory (RAM IC11) coupled to the CPU, and
infrared LEDs and driver circuitry that produce an IR signal to a controlled
device. Id. at 114–115. The remote control may be connected to a personal
computer using three wires from an RS-232 interface. Id. at 119 (“The serial
connector is an RJ-11 telephone jack instead of the usual 25-pin DB-25
connector. Only three wires are required: data from the PC, data to the PC,
and signal ground.”) The personal computer is connected to the remote
control via the RS-232 interface and is “used to set up menus of devices
(receivers, CD players, tape decks) and functions for each device (turn on,
play forward, etc.).” Id. at 114. Once a menu is downloaded to the remote
control, each function is taught and tested, after which a completed menu
and synthesis data are uploaded to the personal computer and “stored on a
disk (in case you want to load it into another Master Controller or add
another device later without retraining all of them).” Id.
Hastreiter
Hastreiter describes keyboard data input assemblies, including
circuitry for minimizing the number of interconnections with a
microprocessor or other apparatus with which a keyboard is used. Ex. 1008,
col. 1:5–10. In particular, Hastreiter describes a keyboard circuit that uses
diodes between row and column lines of the keyboard, similar to the
keyboard circuit described in the ’761 patent. See, e.g., Ex. 1001, Fig. 9B;
Ex. 1008, Figs. 1, 2.
Petitioner’s Assertions
Petitioner relies on Ciarcia to meet all of the claim limitations of the
challenged claims, with the exception of the “input means.” Pet. 48–58.
Based on its construction of “input means” to include at least the
18

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
corresponding structure of a keyboard circuit as shown in Fig. 9B of the
’761 patent, Petitioner relies on the keyboard circuit of Hastreiter in
combination with Ciarcia to meet the “input means.” Id. at 22–23, 29, and
49–50. Petitioner points to teachings in Hastreiter that the keyboard design
can be used to minimize the required number of interconnections with a
microprocessor or other apparatus with which a keyboard is used. Id. at 49–
50; Ex. 1008, 1:5–11. Mr. Bristow opines that skilled artisans at the time of
the invention would have understood that Hastreiter’s keyboard circuit could
have been used in Ciarcia’s remote control to minimize connections to the
microprocessor. Ex. 1013 ¶ 72.
Instruction Codes and/or Code Data
Claim 1 recites “data coupling means including receiving means
coupled to the CPU for enabling at least one of (a) instruction codes or (b)
code data for creating appropriate IR lamp driver instructions . . . to be
supplied from outside the remote control through the receiving means
directly to the CPU for direct entry to the memory.” Claim 9 and claim 10,
which depend from claim 1 also include this limitation. Independent claim
14 and independent claim 15 recite similar language.8 Claims 1, 9, 10, 14,
and 15, thus, recite receiving, or enabling to be supplied from outside the
remote (e.g., from a computer connected to the remote control), instruction
codes or code data. Independent claim 16 and independent claim 17,
however, are different. Claim 16 recites “data coupling means for
8

Claim 14 recites “data coupling means for periodically coupling said
computer to said remote control for receiving from said computer memory
and inputting into said memory means of said remote control at least one of
(a) said instruction codes or (b) said code data for creating appropriate IR
lamp driver instructions.”
19

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
periodically coupling said computer to said remote control for receiving
from said computer memory and inputting into said memory means of said
remote control said instruction codes.” Claim 17 includes this language too.
Claims 16 and 17, therefore, recite receiving (from the computer connected
to the remote control) instruction codes. Receiving code data instead of
instruction codes is not an option.
For the reasons that follow, we determine that Petitioner has shown by
a preponderance of the evidence that Ciarcia describes code data, as recited
in claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15, but has not shown by a preponderance of the
evidence that Ciarcia describes instruction codes as recited and required by
claims 16 and 17.
We first discuss claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15 and “code data.”
Petitioner accounts for the supplying from outside the remote control (e.g., a
computer connected through a cable to the remote control) “code data” by
relying on Ciarcia’s description of downloading synthesis data to the Master
Controller. Pet. 23, 52; Ex. 1009, 114; Ex. 1013 ¶¶ 70–71; Pet. Reply 13,
Ex. 1063 ¶ 48; Tr. 31–32.
Patent Owner contests that missing from the combination of Ciarcia
and Hastreiter is “code data” and, more specifically, that such code data is
supplied to the remote control from a computer outside the remote. PO
Resp. 26. According to Patent Owner, the code data limitation is missing
because Ciarcia does not describe supplying “code data” comprising
instructions from a computer to the remote control. Id. at 27.
As explained above in the claim construction section, Patent Owner
has not shown that “code data” necessarily includes instructions. Rather, as
stated above “code data” includes timing information or data, but need not
20

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
include instructions. Patent Owner concedes that Ciarcia describes
downloading and storing timing information to the remote control. Id.; Ex.
1053, 357; Tr. 41. All that is required for independent claims 1, 14, and 15,
insofar as supplying from a computer to the remote control is concerned is
code data. None of claims 1, 9, 10, 14, or 15 require that instructions or
instruction codes also be supplied from outside the remote control. Rather,
the claim phrase is in the alternative. Based on the record before us,
Petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the evidence, and Patent Owner
concedes, that Ciarcia describes downloading and storing timing information
(code data) to the remote control.
We next turn to independent claims 16 and 17, which require
“instruction codes” for “creating appropriate IR lamp driver instructions.”
Those claims also require data coupling means for periodically coupling a
computer to the remote control for receiving from memory of the computer
and inputting into the memory of the remote control instruction codes.
Thus, claims 16 and 17 require receiving (e.g., downloading) from a
computer coupled to the remote control memory instruction codes.
Petitioner accounts for the receiving from the computer memory (e.g.,
memory of a computer connected through a cable to the remote control)
“instruction codes” by relying on Ciarcia’s description of downloading
menus to the Master Controller. Pet. 23, 52; Ex. 1009, 114; Ex. 1013 ¶¶ 70–
71; Pet. Reply 13, Ex. 1063 ¶ 51. In support of its contention that Ciarcia’s
menus include instructions, Petitioner relies on the testimony of Thomas
Gafford who testifies as follows:
Ciarcia’s “menu” can also include instructions. A skilled
artisan understood at the time that the menu that is loaded into
the remote has information which defines the appearance,
21

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
including names and the hierarchical structure, of the menus
that allow the user to select IR commands. A skilled artisan
also understood that a well known method of defining a menu
was to write a program in a language such as DOS BATCH
(see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_Enhancer) or a
simplified version for a batch interpreter that can reside in the
8031 CPU. In such an implementation which is a mere design
choice for one wishing to write a program of his/her own to
operate the master controller, the menu is expressed in the form
of instructions.
Ex. 1063 ¶ 51.
From the above, Mr. Gafford acknowledges that Ciarcia’s menus do
not necessarily include instructions, only that they can include instructions.
Moreover, Mr. Gafford’s testimony that a well-known method of defining a
menu was to write a program expressed in the form of instructions does not
mean that the menus defined in the Ciarcia reference included such
instructions. We give Mr. Gafford’s testimony little if any weight that
defining menus to include instructions was a mere design choice and well
known at the time of the invention, because the underlying evidence in
support of that assertion has not been shown to be relevant at the time of the
invention. In particular, the content of a current Wikipedia webpage to
which we are directed has not been shown to be relevant to what a person of
ordinary skill in the art would have known at the time of the invention,
which was over twenty years ago.
We have considered Petitioner’s argument in its Reply that Patent
Owner and its expert fail to identify any reasons why downloading
instructions to a static RAM of a remote control would be outside of the
knowledge of skilled artisans. Pet. Reply 16. Petitioner’s assertion misses
22

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
the mark. Petitioner bears the burden to show by a preponderance of the
evidence that the challenged claims are unpatentable.
We also have considered Petitioner’s argument that Ciarcia’s Master
Controller must store instructions in order to generate IR signals. Pet. Reply
13, 15. But even if true, Petitioner has not shown that such instructions are
received or downloaded from a computer memory into the memory of the
remote control as claimed. In that regard, we are not persuaded by
Petitioner’s tangential argument (Pet. Reply 16) that the claims do not
require downloading instructions, when clearly claims 16 and 17 do require
receiving instructions, which we find to be synonymous with downloading
instructions.
Based on the record before us, Petitioner has shown that Ciarcia
describes code data, but has not shown that Ciarcia describes or teaches
receiving from the computer memory (e.g., the computer connected through
a cable to the remote control) “instruction codes” for the above reasons
provided.
Combining Ciarcia and Hastreiter
Patent Owner argues that it would not have been obvious to combine
Ciarcia and Hastreiter. PO Resp. 28–30. We consider this argument for
claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15. As explained above, Petitioner articulates a
rationale with supporting evidence for combining Ciarcia and Hastreiter. In
particular, Petitioner points to teachings in Hastreiter that the keyboard
design can be used to minimize the required number of interconnections
with a microprocessor or other apparatus with which a keyboard is used.
Pet. 49–50; Ex. 1008, 1:5–11. Mr. Bristow opines that skilled artisans at the
time of the invention would have understood that Hastreiter’s keyboard
23

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
circuit could have been used in Ciarcia’s remote control to minimize
connections to the microprocessor. Ex. 1013 ¶ 54. Accordingly, we are not
persuaded by Patent Owner’s conclusory assertion that “[t]he Petition does
not articulate any reason why one having ordinary skill in the art would have
been motivated to combine Ciarcia with Hastreiter.” PO Resp. 28.
Patent Owner also argues that because Hastreiter says nothing about
remote controls it is not in the same field as Ciarcia, directing attention to
Mr. Cook’s testimony, who testifies to the same. Id. at 16; Ex. 2029 ¶ 85.
The test for determining whether a prior art reference constitutes
analogous art to the claimed invention is: (1) whether the prior art is from
the same field of endeavor, regardless of the problem addressed, and (2) if
the reference is not within the field of the inventor’s endeavor, whether the
reference still is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which
the inventor is involved. See In re Bigio, 381 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir.
2004).
Here, Patent Owner has not explained sufficiently why Hastreiter is
from a different field of endeavor as that of the claimed invention. Patent
Owner’s comparison between the fields of endeavor of Ciarcia and
Hastreiter misses the mark. In any event, Patent Owner’s argument that
Hastreiter is not in the same field as Ciarcia is conclusory, as is Mr. Cook’s
testimony. Neither explain why that is so. In addition, Patent Owner has not
addressed the second prong of the above test. And, importantly, during
cross examination, Mr. Cook testified that the field of “keypad design is
inherently a field that people in remote controls are aware of.” Ex. 1053,
427:21–25. Such a statement would tend to support a finding that Hastreiter
is analogous art. Hastreiter is concerned with circuitry interconnections
24

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
between a microprocessor and a keyboard data input assembly and even
goes as far as to state that it is applicable for apparatuses that use keyboards.
Ex. 1008, col. 1:5–10. The claimed invention recites a remote control (an
apparatus) with an input means including a set of keys or pushbuttons for
inputting commands (e.g., a keyboard), where the input means is coupled to
a microprocessor, which processes the commands. Based on the record
before us, we find that Hastreiter is analogous art.
Patent Owner also argues that Ciarcia teaches away from any
combination with Hastreiter. PO Resp. 29. Patent Owner argues that the
keypad arrangement disclosed in Hastreiter is unnecessarily complex to be
used in Ciarcia’s remote, and that a person of ordinary skill in the art would
not have looked to Hastreiter for a keyboard data input assembly that
minimized the number of diode switches used (interconnections) because the
Ciarcia remote control only has six keys, such that minimizing
interconnections would not be a concern. Id. at 29–30; Ex. 2029 ¶¶ 76–86,
94, and 95. We are not persuaded by Patent Owner’s arguments.
Hastreiter is not limited to only keyboards “having a large number of
hard keys” as Mr. Cook asserts. Ex. 2029 ¶ 89. Rather, Hastreiter explains
that although a five by five array of keyboard conductors is shown, a person
having ordinary skill in the art would have understood that “the present
invention may be easily adapted to a square matrix of any size.” Ex. 1008,
col. 3:31–34. For this reason, we do not give Mr. Cook’s testimony
substantial weight that Hastreiter is limited to only keyboards having a large
number of keys, and thus is unnecessarily complex to be used in Ciarcia’s
remote, because that testimony is not supported by what Hastreiter actually
conveys to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For similar reasons, we are
25

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
not persuaded by Mr. Cook’s testimony that “Ciarcia’s remote control would
not benefit from Hastreiter’s keypad arrangement because Ciarcia’s remote
has very few keys” and that the “benefit of Hastreiter’s keypad arrangement
increases as the number of keys required grows larger.” Ex. 2029 ¶ 94.
Again, Hastreiter is not limited to only keypads with a large number of keys
and even Mr. Cook recognizes that, although the benefit may increase with
more keys on a keypad, there is still a benefit from the Hastreiter
arrangement that reduces the number of electrical interconnections between
the keypad and the microprocessor. Id. “[I]f a technique has been used to
improve one device, and a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize
that it would improve similar devices in the same way, using the technique is
obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill.” KSR, 550
U.S. at 417.
Objective Evidence of Nonobviousness
Factual inquiries for an obviousness determination include secondary
considerations based on evaluation and crediting of objective evidence of
nonobviousness. Graham, 383 U.S. at 17. Notwithstanding what the
teachings of the prior art would have suggested to a person of ordinary skill
in the art at the time of the claimed invention, the totality of evidence
submitted, including objective evidence of nonobviousness, may lead to a
conclusion that the claimed invention would not have been obvious to one
with ordinary skill in the art. In re Piasecki, 745 F.2d 1468, 1471–72 (Fed.
Cir. 1984). Secondary considerations may include any of the following:
long-felt but unresolved needs, failure of others, unexpected results,
commercial success, copying, licensing, and praise.

26

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
There must be a demonstrated “nexus” between the merits of the
claimed invention and the evidence of secondary considerations before that
evidence is accorded substantial weight in an obviousness determination.
Simmons Fastener Corp. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 739 F.2d 1573, 1575
(Fed. Cir. 1984); Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., 713 F.2d 1530, 1539
(Fed. Cir. 1983); see also In re Huang, 100 F.3d 135, 140 (Fed. Cir. 1996);
In re Fielder, 471 F.2d 640, 642 (CCPA 1973). “Nexus” is a legally and
factually sufficient connection between the objective evidence and the
claimed invention, such that the objective evidence should be considered in
determining nonobviousness. Demaco Corp. v. F. Von Langsdorff Licensing
Ltd., 851 F.2d 1387, 1392 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In the absence of an established
nexus with the claimed invention, secondary consideration factors such as
commercial success, satisfaction of a long-felt but unresolved need,
licensing and copying by others are not entitled to much, if any, weight and
generally have no bearing on the legal issue of obviousness. See In re
Vamco Machine & Tool, Inc., 752 F.2d 1564, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
The burden of showing that there is a nexus lies with the Patent
Owner. Id.; see In re Paulsen, 30 F.3d 1475, 1482 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
Patent Owner argues that several patents owned by Patent Owner,
including the ’761 patent, were licensed by a substantial portion of the
industry, showing commercial acquiescence and competitor acceptance of
Patent Owner’s licensed patents. PO Resp. 32–33. The mere existence of
several licensees, without more specific information about the circumstances
surrounding the licensing, is not a good indicator of nonobviousness. In
EWP Corp. v Reliance Universal Inc., 755 F.2d 898, 907–08 (Fed. Cir.
1985), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated:
27

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
Such [licensing] programs are not infallible guides to
patentability. They sometimes succeed because they are
mutually beneficial to the licensed group or because of business
judgments that it is cheaper to take licenses than to defend
infringement suits, or for other reasons unrelated to the
unobviousness of the licensed subject matter.
Here, we would want to know the circumstances surrounding the
licenses. Patent Owner directs us to no testimony from any licensee with
regard to why the licensee took a license from Patent Owner. It is unknown
how much of the decision to take a license stems from a business costbenefit analysis with regard to defending an infringement suit or from
another business reason, rather than from acknowledged merits of the
claimed invention. Patent Owner also does not disclose how many entities
refused to take a license or why some entities, if any, refused to take a
license. Four licensees may not represent a very successful licensing
program if the field of potential application of Patent Owner’s technology
includes a large number of potential licensees.
Patent Owner also argues that it, through its upgradeable remotes, and
one of its licensees, Logitech, through its Harmony Remotes, has enjoyed
tremendous commercial worldwide success. PO Resp. 33. In particular,
Patent Owner argues that it is a market leader in original equipment
manufacturing of universal remote controls and made approximately $1.6
billion in worldwide gross sales from 2000 to 2013. Id. Patent Owner
argues that Logitech is the established market leader in consumer universal
remote controls since 2007 and that from 2007 through 2014, Logitech
averaged $100 million in worldwide net sales of remote controls, a

28

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
substantial number of sales containing the technology of the claimed
invention. Id. at 33–34.
Patent Owner does not describe for us the components or manner of
operation of the products sold by it or Logitech. Rather, Patent Owner
directs us to several paragraphs from the Ammari Declaration. Ex. 2064.9
Ammari directs us to claim charts that were created during litigation
between Patent Owner and Logitech, along with several user manuals of
several of Logitech’s remote control products. Id. ¶¶ 20–24. Ammari
testifies that the manuals depict remotes that are upgradeable via a
connection to a computer and that when using a Harmony Remote, a user
uses software or an online service to configure downloaded code data to the
remote control. Id. ¶¶ 23, 24. Such a showing does not establish a nexus
between the alleged commercially successful products and the claimed
invention.
First, we do not know the context of the litigation between Logitech
and Patent Owner, such as whether Logitech agreed to the charge of
infringement. Based on the record before us, Patent Owner has not
established that the infringement charts are meritorious insofar as showing a
nexus is concerned. Moreover, Patent Owner has not shown sufficiently that
any of the Logitech manuals would have conveyed to a user to use
“Logitech’s desktop software or an online service to configure downloaded
code data to the remote control” as Ammari contends. Ex. 2064 ¶ 24. We
do not give much weight to Mr. Ammari’s testimony in this regard because
it is conclusory. He does not direct us to where in any of the manuals there
9

At the time of his Declaration, Ammari was employed by Patent Owner
and has been employed by Patent Owner since 1997. Ex. 2064 ¶¶ 1, 4.
29

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
is a description of configuring a remote control to download code data to the
remote control.
In any event, we do not know why $100 million of Logitech’s or $1
billion of Patent Owner’s sales constitutes commercial success. It is well
established that absolute sale numbers without market share data does not
establish commercial success. See, e.g., In re Huang, 100 F.3d at 140.
Patent Owner’s Response does not discuss and present market share
information.
In addition, Patent Owner must prove that the sales were a direct
result of the unique characteristics of the invention, and not a result of
economic and commercial factors unrelated to the quality of the patent
subject matter. In re Applied Materials, Inc., 692 F.3d 1289, 1299–1300
(Fed. Cir. 2012). In addition, “if the commercial success is due to an
unclaimed feature of the device” or “if the feature that creates the
commercial success was known in the prior art, the success is not pertinent.”
Ormco Corp., v. Align Tech., Inc., 463 F.3d 1299, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see
also In re Huai-Hung Kao, 639 F.3d 1057, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (requiring
a determination of “whether the commercial success of the embodying
product resulted from the merits of the claimed invention as opposed to the
prior art or other extrinsic factors”). Here, Patent Owner has not directed us
to evidence to explain the reasons for the alleged commercial success of
Logitech’s and Patent Owner’s remote controls.
For all of the foregoing reasons, Patent Owner has failed to establish
the necessary “nexus” between the evidence of alleged commercial success
and the invention claimed.

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
Conclusion
We have considered the entirety of the evidence before us, including
evidence of obviousness and evidence of licensing and commercial success
submitted by Patent Owner as an indicia of nonobviousness. On balance,
the evidence of obviousness outweighs the evidence of nonobviousness,
with respect to claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15. The evidence of obviousness is
strong and the evidence of nonobviousness is weak, for the reasons
discussed above.
All of Patent Owner’s arguments have been considered. Petitioner
has proved, by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and
15 are unpatentable over the combination of Ciarcia and Hastreiter, but has
not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 16 and 17 are
unpatentable over the combination of Ciarcia and Hastreiter.
E. Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude
Patent Owner moves to exclude Exhibit 1043 and portions of
Petitioner’s Reply that rely on Exhibit 1043 as not relevant to the
proceeding. PO Mot. to Exclude 1. The parties refer to Exhibit 1043 as a
data sheet for an Intel 8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). Ciarcia
describes a 8254 PIT that is programmed to generate IR signals. Ex. 1009,
118–119. We have determined that Petitioner has demonstrated, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15 are
unpatentable, without considering the datasheet. Even considering the
arguments at page 15 of Petitioner’s Reply with respect to the datasheet for
claims 16 and 17, we are not persuaded that Petitioner has shown that
Ciarcia describes or teaches receiving from the computer memory (e.g.,
downloading from the computer connected through a cable to the remote
31

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
control) “instruction codes” as recited in those claims. Accordingly, we
dismiss Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude.
F. Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude
Petitioner moves to exclude portions of Exhibit 1053 and portions of
Ex. 1054. Exhibits 1053 and 1054 are deposition transcripts of Patent
Owner’s witness, Mr. Alex Cook. With respect to both exhibits, Petitioner
moves to exclude portions of Mr. Cook’s testimony for, among other
reasons, being unreliable. Pet. Mot. to Exclude, 1. In particular, Petitioner
moves to exclude Exhibit 1053 at 419:1–2, 419:14–15, 420:5–21, 421:8–
422:2, and 422:9–13, and Exhibit 1054 at 745:4–8, 745:15–746:1, 746:13–
747:4, 747:11–16, 747:22, 748:2, 749:10–11, 749:17–21, and 750:23–751:3.
Id.
Petitioner has not shown that Patent Owner relied on either Exhibit
1053 or 1054 in support of its papers filed in this proceeding, nor do we find
that Patent Owner relied on either exhibit in support of its papers filed in this
proceeding. Moreover, Petitioner has not shown that it relied on the
objected to portions of either exhibit in support of its papers filed in this
proceeding, not do we find that Petitioner relied on the objected to portions
of either exhibit in support of its papers filed in this proceeding. Because we
were not directed to the objected to portions of the evidence in any papers
before us, we did not and need not consider the objected to portions of
Exhibits 1053 and 1054 in rendering this Decision. Accordingly, we dismiss
Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude.
G. Motions to Seal
Patent Owner and Petitioner each filed several papers (e.g., Paper 14)
and exhibits (e.g., Exhibit 1050) under seal, along with motions to seal
32

IPR2014-01104
Patent 5,414,761
(Papers 15 and 22) and a protective order (Ex. 2065). The motions are
unopposed and are granted.
There is an expectation that information will be made public where
the information is identified in a Final Written Decision, and that
confidential information that is subject to a protective order ordinarily would
become public 45 days after final judgment in a trial, unless a motion to
expunge is granted. 37 C.F.R. § 42.56; Office Patent Trial Practice Guide,
77 Fed. Reg. 48,756, 48,761 (Aug. 14, 2012). In rendering this Final
Written Decision, it was not necessary to identify, nor discuss in detail, any
confidential information. A party who is dissatisfied with this Final Written
Decision may appeal the Decision pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 141(c), and has
63 days after the date of this Decision to file a notice of appeal. 37 C.F.R.
§ 90.3(a).
In view of the foregoing, the confidential documents filed in the
instant proceeding will remain under seal, at least until the time period for
filing a notice of appeal has expired or, if an appeal is taken, the appeal
process has concluded. The record for the instant proceeding will be
preserved in its entirety, and the confidential documents will not be
expunged or made public, pending appeal. Notwithstanding 37 C.F.R.

ORDERED that claims 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15 of the ’761 patent are held
unpatentable;
FURTHER ORDERED that the parties’ respective motions to seal are
granted;
FURTHER ORDERED that the parties’ respective motions to exclude
evidence are dismissed; and
FURTHER ORDERED that, because this is a Final Written Decision,
parties to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must
comply with the notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
