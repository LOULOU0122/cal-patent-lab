Petitioner has not challenged claim 15 of the ʼ758 patent.
F. Oral Argument
Oral argument was held on 23 November 2015.
Prior to oral argument, and based on the Petition, Opposition, and
Reply, the Board invited the parties to address specific issues at oral
argument. Paper 53, pages 6–8.
4

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
A transcript of oral argument has been placed in the record. Paper 58.
Some of the oral argument presented by both parties was not
consistent with oral argument procedure applicable before the Board. In
particular, arguments were made that were not based on arguments in the
Petition, Opposition, or Reply. In addition, explanations were proffered that
are not supported by evidence in the record or arguments previously made in
the Petition, Opposition, or Reply. See, e.g., Transcript of Oral Argument,
Paper 58, page 14:5–22.
Oral argument is governed in part by 37 C.F.R. § 42.70(a) (first
sentence) (italics added):
(a) A party may request oral argument on an issue raised
in a paper at a time set by the Board.
The Trial Practice Guidelines advise as follows:
A party may rely upon evidence that has been previously
submitted in the proceeding and may only present
arguments relied upon in the papers previously submitted.
No new evidence or arguments may be presented at the
oral argument.
Office Patent Trial Practice Guide, 77 Fed. Reg. 48756, 48768 (col. 2)
(Aug. 14, 2012) (italics added).
The rationale in support of the Rule and Guideline is fundamental
fairness to an opponent. 37 C.F.R. § 42.1(b) (Part 42 “shall be construed to
secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive resolution of every proceeding.”)
It is not just to an opponent for a party to raise an argument not based on the
Petition, Opposition, or Reply, or to discuss evidence not in the record.
Why? There is no meaningful opportunity for the opponent to rebut the
argument or address the evidence. Likewise, the Board is at a disadvantage
5

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
because judges do not prepare for oral argument based on arguments and
evidence not present in the record.
To the extent that arguments and discussions took place at oral
argument in this case contrary to the principles set out above, those
arguments and discussions have not been considered in rendering a decision
on the merits and are not considered to be properly in the record.
G. The ʼ758 Patent
1. Claim 1
The invention is generally understood from claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent,
which reads [some indentation and matter in brackets added]:
A method of regenerating a devitalized absorber
having nitrogen oxides absorbed therein or thereon, said
method comprising the steps of:
[A] providing a stream of regenerating gas
comprising [A1] a reducing gas, said reducing gas having
an effective amount for removing said nitrogen oxides
from said devitalized absorber, and [A2] an inert carrier
gas; and
[B] passing said stream of regenerating gas
comprising [B1] an inert carrier gas and [B2] a component
selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, carbon
monoxide and mixtures thereof over said devitalized
absorber comprising
[1] an alumina support with
[2] a platinum coating thereon and having
nitrogen oxides absorbed therein or thereon for
[C1] an effective time,
[C2] at an effective temperature and
6

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758

[C3] at an effective space velocity
[D] to remove said nitrogen oxides from said
devitalized absorber to form a regenerated absorber.
Ex. 1001A, 9:28–44.
2. Details of the Invention
According to the ʼ758 patent, “[t]he principal component of the
gaseous stream is an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen, helium, argon,
or steam.” Ex. 1001A, 2:60–62.
Further according to the ʼ758 patent:
The regeneration gas comprises a reactant gas or
mixture of reactant gases along with a carrier gas or carrier
gas mixture. The reactant gases are reactive reducing
agents to convert the oxidized forms of the absorber made
in the absorption step. The preferred reactants gases are
carbon monoxide or hydrogen or combinations of carbon
monoxide and hydrogen. The reactant gases make up
about 500 ppm to 10 percent of the regeneration gas; the
remainder of the regeneration gas is the carrier gas mixture.
Ex. 1001A, 2:66–3:7.
III. Analysis—Ground 1 (Hirota)
The principal issue with respect to Ground 1 is whether Hirota
describes an inert carrier gas. Petitioner says “yes” and Patent Owner
says “no.”
The ʼ758 patent contains the following discussion:
The regeneration gas comprises a reactant gas or mixture
of reactant gases along with a carrier gas or carrier gas
mixture. The reactant gases are reactive reducing agents
to convert the oxidized forms of the absorber made in the
7

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
absorption step. The preferred reactants gases are carbon
monoxide or hydrogen or combinations of carbon
monoxide and hydrogen. The reactant gases make up
about 500 ppm to 10 percent of the regeneration gas; the
remainder of the regeneration gas is the carrier gas mixture.
The carrier gas may comprise principally nitrogen
or steam, for example, preferred 50 percent or more
nitrogen and may have smaller concentrations of carbon
dioxide and steam or 50 percent or more steam and may
have smaller concentrations of nitrogen and carbon
dioxide. Nitrogen in high concentrations of about 50% to
about 80% provides an excellent carrier for the reductants.
Steam is also a good carrier in concentrations of 30% to
98% with the balance being nitrogen.
The regeneration gas is substantially oxygen free,
although up to one percent oxygen may be present without
significant negative effects.
Ex. 1001A, col. 2:66–col. 3:18 (italics added).
The patent involved in IPR2014-01556, U.S. Patent 5,953,911,
(“the ʼ911 patent”) contains a similar discussion. IPR2014-01556,
Ex. 1001A, col. 3:6–30.
In our Final Written Decision in IPR2014-01556, we
interpreted similar language based on a similar specification to limit
the amount of oxygen in the regeneration gas to no more than one
percent. IPR2014-01556, Paper 57, pages 15–16.
Based on arguments made in IPR2014-01556, that are
essentially the same arguments made in this IPR, we held that
Petitioner had not established that Hirota’s corresponding
regeneration gas had an oxygen amount of no more than up to one
percent oxygen.
8

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
We see no need to repeat that discussion here, and adopt it as
written therein.
Petitioner has failed to establish that Hirota describes a
regeneration gas falling within the scope of the regeneration gas
of claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent.
Accordingly, Petitioner has failed to satisfy its burden of
proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject matter of
claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent is anticipated by Hirota.
Claims 2, 4–6, 9, 11, and 12 depend from claim 1 and therefore
likewise are not anticipated.
IV. Analysis—Ground 2 (Takeshima)
A. Background
Petitioner maintains that Takeshima (Ex. 1007A) anticipates
independent claim 1 and dependent claims 2, 4, 9, 11, and 12 of the
ʼ758 patent. Paper 3, pages 12 and 28–37.
Patent Owner disagrees. Paper 29, pages 12–14.2
In IPR2014-01555, we found that Petitioner failed to establish
that claims involved in that IPR were anticipated by Takeshima. In
particular, we found that Petitioner failed to establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that Takeshima describes a

In support of its argument, Patent Owner refers to an Inui reference.
Ex. 1007B in IPR2014-01555. The Inui reference was not made of record
in this IPR. Inui is not addressed in Petitioner’s Reply. Incorporation by
reference in a first IPR to evidence is a second IPR is not permitted.
Accordingly, neither the Inui reference nor the argument on page13:6
through page 14:8 of Patent Owner’s Opposition have been considered.

9

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
“component being intimately and entirely coated with an absorber
selected from a hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate or mixtures thereof
of an alkali or alkaline earth or mixtures thereof” as required by
claim 1 of the patent involved in the IPR. IPR2014-01555, Paper 50,
page 12.
B. Facts
The challenged claims of the involved ʼ758 patent in this IPR
do not contain an “intimately and entirely coated” limitation.
Hence, the evaluation here of anticipation is on a different basis
than that in IPR2014-01555, i.e., whether Takeshima describes, in the
words of claim 1, “an alumina support with a platinum coating.”
According to Patent Owner, “Takeshima does not disclose a
method involving a material including an alumina support with a
platinum coating thereon.” Paper 29, page 12:13–14 (italics added).
Patent Owner therefore maintains that Petitioner has not established
that Takeshima describes the limitation:
[1]

an alumina support with

[2]

a platinum coating thereon and having
nitrogen oxides absorbed therein or thereon

as set out in Part [B] of claim 1 as reproduced above.
In its claim chart, Petitioner explains how the limitation is said
to be described by Takeshima:

10

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
Claim 1 coating limitation
passing . . . [a] stream of
regenerating gas . . . over . . . [a]
devitalized absorber comprising an
alumina support with a platinum
coating thereon . . . .

Takeshima
A method of regenerating a
devitalized catalytic NOx
absorbent comprising
platinum and barium oxide
disposed on an alumina
carrier. See Ex.1007[A] at
col. 2, ln. 10-14; col. 5, ln. 19, 24-30; col. 5, ln. 45 - col.
6, ln. 1; col. 6, ln. 24-42.

Paper 3, page 34 (italics added).
We have not been directed to any discussion in the ʼ758 patent
describing what is meant by “a platinum coating thereon.” In fact the
ʼ758 patent itself talks in terms of platinum being “disposed” on the
alumina support:
In commonly assigned [Campbell] U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,558
[Ex. 1003A], which is incorporated herein in its entirety, a
catalyst/absorber is described and consists of a support with an
alumina washcoat disposed thereover, a platinum catalyst
disposed on the washcoat, and with an alkali or alkaline earth
carbonate or bicarbonate coating thereon, the carbonate coating
being lithium, sodium, potassium or calcium carbonate.
Ex. 1001A, col. 1:55–2:3 (italics added).
Figure 1 of the incorporated by reference Campbell ʼ558 patent
is reproduced below:

11

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758

Depicted in Figure 1A of Campbell is a schematic drawing of a catalyst
absorber sphere for use in a process for making
the novel catalyst absorber of a preferred embodiment.
Ex. 1003A, col. 3:36–37.
According to Campbell ’558, “FIG. la shows a spherical catalyst
absorber made up of an alumina sphere 10 with a platinum coating 12 and a
carbonate coating 14 thereon.” Ex. 1003A, col. 4:67–col. 5:1. Campbell
ʼ558 also mentions “platinum coated spheres.” Ex. 1003A, col. 5:30–31.
We turn to Takeshima.
The relevant information as outlined in Petitioner’s claim chart,
appears to be as follows (italics added):

Takeshima
Col. 2:10-14

Col. 5:1-9

Description in Takeshima
An object of the . . . invention is to provide an
exhaust purification device which can efficiently
absorb NOx without a complex construction of the
exhaust system and can release the absorbed NOx
according to need.
The NOx absorbent 18 in the casing 19 uses, for
example, alumina as a carrier. On this carrier, at
least one substance selected from alkali metals, for
example, potassium K, sodium Na, lithium Li, and
Cesium Cs; alkali earth metals, for example barium
12

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
Ba and Calcium Ca; rare earth metals, for example
lanthanum La and yttrium Y; and precious metals
such as platinum Pt, is carried.
Note: Absorbent 18 and casing 19 are shown in a
portion of Takeshima Fig. 1:

Petitioner’s witness, Dr. Robert J. Farrauto, in discussing
Takeshima, does not address “coating” in his direct declaration
testimony. Ex. 1010A, ¶¶ 27–32.
In the Reply, Petitioner notes that the opposition is limited to
arguing a lack of a description of a platinum coating. Paper 40,
page 7.
Patent Owner’s witness, Dr. Mark Crocker, was of the opinion that
“[w]hen a reference refers to a carrier, this does not indicate that the carrier
is coated with the carried material.” Ex. 2004, ¶ 17.
Petitioner observes that the underlying basis for Dr. Crocker’s
¶ 17 testimony is not identified. Paper 40, page 8.
Nevertheless, Dr. Crocker was cross-examined on the matter:
Q. Okay. So you just don't coat the whole thing with
platinum? The -- I'm sorry. You just don't coat the alumina
support entirely with platinum? It's the platinum atoms
are dispersed?
A. Correct.

13

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
Q. And how widely are they dispersed on the alumina
support?
A. Obviously, that depends on a number of factors. It
depends on the platinum loading, it depends on the
efficacy of the catalyst preparation method, and it depends
upon the history of the catalyst, i.e., to the conditions to
which its being exposed.
Q. Okay. And one of ordinary skill in the art can take all
of those factors into account and determine the dispersion
that should be used?
A. Well, one -- one aims for the highest dispersion
possible when preparing the catalyst.
Q. Why is that?
A. In that way one makes the most efficient use of the
supported platinum.
Q. Because platinum's expensive?
A. Platinum is expensive.
Q. So you want to use –
A. You want to use it as efficiently as possible.
Q. Is there some measure of dispersion or efficiency so
that you can compare one dispersion rate, I guess would
be the proper term, to another dispersion rate so that your
bosses will make sure that you're making the most
effective use of the expensive platinum?
A. Yes. As part of the standards procedure for
characterizing a catalyst, one typically performs hydrogen
chem esorption in which one essentially titrates the surface
platinum atoms with hydrogen, and by measuring the
14

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
amount of hydrogen taken up one gains an accurate
measure of the number of exposed platinum atoms, and
from that and knowing the platinum loading, one can
calculate the dispersion.
Q. So when you use the phrase that the “alumina support
is coated with platinum,” that doesn't mean that the
entirety of the alumina is covered by platinum atoms,
correct?
A. Exactly. In fact, as a chemist, I would typically not use
the term “coated,” but that is the language which is
typically used in many patents.
Q. And what is your understanding of the meaning of the
word “coated” as it is used in those patents that you were
referring to?
A. It depends on the context. If one is talking about
coating a wash coat onto a monolithic substrate, then I take
that to mean covering the entirety of the monolith. When
it's talking about coating a catalyst wash coat with
platinum, then I take that to mean depositing a certain
amount of platinum on that wash coat.
Ex. 1056, page 13:2 to page 15:2 (italics added).
Dr. Crocker further testified on cross-examination:
Q. Okay. What do you understand the phrase “an alumina
support with a platinum coating thereon” to mean?
A. I take that to mean an alumina support material onto
which platinum has been deposited, but to my mind that
does not imply that the platinum forms a continuous
monolayer.
Ex. 1056, page 80:22 – page 81:1.
Dr. Crocker still further testified:

15

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
Q. Okay. So with respect to Claim 1, when you're
interpreting Claim 1 of the '758 patent to that effect, do
you then apply the same meaning when looking at a prior
art reference that has platinum deposited on a carrier?
A. Yes, I do, because my chemical intuition tells me that
one is never going to want to completely coat the surface
of a carrier with a monolayer of platinum.
Ex. 1056, page 83:3–9.
On cross-examination, Dr. Crocker agreed that “carried” (the
term used by Takeshima) would be understood as not wanting to
completely coat the surface of a carrier with a monolayer of platinum.
C. Discussion
According to the Campbell patent, incorporated by reference
into the involved ʼ758 patent, Figure 1a of the Campbell patent
describes a “preferred embodiment.” Ex. 1003A, col. 3:36–37.
Claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent calls for “an alumina support with a
platinum coating thereon.” Ex. 1001A, col. 9:39.
An embodiment described in the Campbell patent, incorporated
by reference into the involved ʼ758 patent, is “an alumina sphere 10
with a platinum coating 12 . . . thereon.” Ex. 1003A, col. 4:68
through col. 5:1.3
Given that the language of claim 1 of the ʼ758 is the same as
the language describing the mentioned embodiment, we hold that the

We note that the ʼ758 patent refers to other applications, said to be
incorporated by reference. These other applications, however, have not been
made of record in this IPR.
3

16

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
language “an alumina sphere with a platinum coating thereon” is best
defined as one in which the platinum is intimately and entirely coating
the alumina support, as shown in Figure 1a of the ʼ758 patent.
There is tension between Dr. Crocker’s cross-examination
testimony and the description of “coating thereon” in the ʼ758 patent
when considered in light of the incorporated by reference
Campbell ’558 patent. So, at first blush, our claim interpretation
may appear to be at odds with Dr. Crocker’s cross-examination.
Dr. Crocker nowhere explains his position vis-à-vis Figure 1 of the
Campbell patent. Nor does Dr. Crocker meaningfully address the use
of the word “disposed” as it appears in unchallenged claim 13 of
the ’758 patent. Ex. 1001A, col. 10:28.
Takeshima describes the platinum as “carried” on the alumina
support. Ex. 1007A, col. 5:8–9. Dr. Crocker is of the opinion that
carried does not mean forming a continuous layer, such as that shown
in Figure 1a of the Campbell patent: “I take that to mean an alumina
support material onto which platinum has been deposited, but to my
mind that does not imply that the platinum forms a continuous
monolayer.” Ex. 1056, page 80:24 – page 81:1.
Takeshima does not explicitly describe an alumina support with
a continuous layer of platinum coated thereon. Rather, Takeshima
describes an alumina support with platinum carried thereon. We
credit that part of Dr. Crocker’s testimony discussing why a
continuous layer of platinum is not described by Takeshima.
We also note that in its claim chart, Petitioner uses the word
“disposed” which is the same word used in unchallenged claim 13 of

17

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
the ʼ758 patent. In our view, “disposed thereon” is broader than
“coating thereon.”
For the reasons given, we find that Petitioner has failed to
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Takeshima
describes “an alumina support with a platinum coating thereon” as
recited in claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent. The platinum carried on an
alumina support of Takeshima may be (1) coated thereon in a
continuous form or (2) disposed thereon in a non-continuous form.
Since the record does not establish which of possibilities (1) or (2) is
described by Takeshima, we find that Takeshima cannot anticipate.
Takeshima therefore does not anticipate claim 1 of the ʼ758
patent.
Since the remaining challenged claims depend from claim 1,
Petitioner has failed to establish anticipation with respect to those
dependent claims.
V. Analysis—Ground 3 (Saito)
A. Background
Petitioner maintains that Saito (Ex. 1008B) anticipates
claim 1–9, 11–14, 16 and 20 of the ’758 patent. Paper 3, pages 12
and 37–44.
Patent Owner disagrees. Paper 29, pages 14–24.
B. Petition
According to Petitioner’s claim chart (Paper 3, pages 40–41),
reproduced in part below, claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent is anticipated by
Saito.

agent so as to regenerate the
oxidative absorption capacity of the
catalyst. (p. 3). “[T]he reducing
temperature is preferably 150 to
800° C, and in particular 200 to
700° C, the space velocity is a
function of the concentration of the
reducing agent, but the range of 10
to 100,000 Hr-1is suitable. There are
no particular limits on the
processing time, but in the range of
1 minute to 1 hour is preferred.” (p.
4).

The relevant part of the cited portion of Saito (Ex. 1008B) is as
follows:
[A] catalyst . . . [comprising] a metal, oxide or complex
oxide of at least one element selected from the group of
20

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, silver, zinc,
chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, niobium,
tantalum, cerium, lanthanum, titanium, zirconium,
aluminum, silicon, tin, lead, phosphorus, sulfur, alkaline
earth metals comprising calcium, magnesium, strontium,
and barium, alkali metals comprising lithium, sodium,
potassium, rubidium, and cesium and precious metals
comprising platinum, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium.
Ex. 1008B, renumbered page 1, col. 1 (emphasis added).
According to Petitioner:
Saito discloses that the catalyst can comprise platinum and
barium oxide.
[S]aid catalyst comprises a metal, oxide or complex oxide
of at least one element selected from the group of
manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, silver, zinc,
chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, niobium,
tantalum, cerium, lanthanum, titanium, zirconium,
aluminum, silicon, tin, lead, phosphorus, sulfur, alkaline
earth metals comprising calcium, magnesium, strontium,
and barium, alkali metals comprising lithium, sodium,
potassium, rubidium, and cesium and precious metals
comprising platinum, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium.
Paper 3, pages 37–38 (emphasis in original); Ex. 1008B, page 1, col. 1.
As noted by Patent Owner, Dr. Farrauto does not appear to
discuss Saito. Paper 29, page 16.

C. Opposition
In opposition, Patent Owner relies on the direct Declaration
testimony of Dr. Crocker:
Saito does not specifically disclose a Pt-BaO absorbent
([Paper 3] . . ., p. 39). Saito cites a catalyst comprising a
metal, oxide or complex oxide of at least one element
selected from a list of thirty-six elements (of which thirty21

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
four are metals or metalloids and two are non-metals) ([Ex.
1008B,] Saito, p. 1). Thus, thousands of different element
combinations are possible (even when combining only two
elements in the elemental or oxide form). The example
given cites the use of a lanthanum-cobalt complex oxide
([Ex. 1008B,] Saito, p. 4).
Ex. 2004, ¶ 21.
No cross-examination relative to Dr. Crocker’s ¶ 21 direct
testimony has been called to our attention.
Patent Owner argues in its Opposition that there are too many
possibilities described by Saito to establish anticipation. Accordingly,
says Patent Owner, Saito does not describe a specific combination of
platinum and barium oxide. Paper 29, pages 18–19. In effect, Patent
Owner says there are too many “selections” needed to come up with
the combination set out in claim 1. Id. at 18.
D. Reply
Petitioner claims precedent is against Patent Owner’s
“selections” argument, citing In re Petering, 301 F.2d 676 (CCPA
1962) and In re Schaumann, 572 F.2d 312 (CCPA 1978), both of
which held that anticipation was justified based on the number of
options described in prior art references. Paper 40, page 13.
C. Discussion
There is precedent supporting Patent Owner’s “selection”
argument. In re Arkley, 455 F.2d 586, 587 (CCPA 1972). A
concurring opinion disagreed with what was there referred to as a
“picking” and “choosing” analysis; rather it maintained that
anticipation should be determined on the basis of the prior art

22

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
disclosure is “sufficient to put the public in possession of the
[claimed] invention.” 455 F.2d at 590. In one sense the concurrence
has a point, because it can be said that it was Patent Owner’s inventors
who selected from various options described in the prior art.
A recent decision of our appellate reviewing court clarifies the
anticipation test as follows:
A [claim in a] patent is . . . [unpatentable] if “the [claimed]
invention was patented or described in a printed
publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or
on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date
of application for patent in the United States.”. . . A prior
art reference can only anticipate a claim if it discloses all
the claimed limitations “arranged or combined in the same
way as in the claim.”. . . However, a reference can
anticipate a claim even if it “d[oes] not expressly spell out”
all the limitations arranged or combined as in the claim, if
a person of skill in the art, reading the reference, would “at
once envisage” the claimed arrangement or combination.
In re Petering, 49 CCPA 993, 301 F.2d 676, 681 (1962).
Kennametal, Inc. v. Ingersoll Cutting Tool Co., 780 F.3d 1376, 1381
(Fed. Cir. 2015).
Consistent with Petering and Kennametal, what we have to
factually determine on the record before us is: Has Petitioner
established by a preponderance of the evidence that one skilled in the
art would “at once envisage” a platinum/barium oxide combination
based on the description set out in Saito as quoted above?
In our view, whether a particular embodiment or sub-genus of
embodiments is “at once envisaged” can be a function of the number
of possible combinations set out in the prior art. If the number is
small, then it is possible that a claimed combination may be
23

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
envisaged. On the other hand, if the possible combination is large,
then there is less likelihood that a claimed combination would be
envisaged. What is certain is that there is no per se rule on the point.
The burden of proof is on Petitioner to prove that one skilled in
the art would have “envisaged” the catalyst/absorber combination
claimed by Patent Owner.
Petitioner suggests that the cited portion of Saito describes the
claimed combination of catalyst and absorbent. However, we have
found no persuasive reasoning backing up the suggestion. On the
other hand Patent Owner, based on Dr. Crocker’s direct Declaration
testimony, notes that there are “thousands of different element
combinations are possible (even when combining only two elements
in the elemental or oxide form).” Paper 29, page 17; Ex. 2004, ¶ 21.
In the face of Dr. Crocker’s testimony, Petitioner has not
satisfactorily explained why one skilled in the art would “envisage”
Patent Owner’s claimed catalyst/absorber combination from the
thousands of combinations described by Saito.
Accordingly, we are unable—on this record—to find that
Petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that
Saito describes the claimed combination.
We therefore find that Saito does not anticipate the subject
matter of claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent.
It follows that Saito likewise does not anticipate any challenged
claim depending from claim 1.
Patent Owner argues an “intimate and entirely coated”
limitation appearing in independent claim 13. Paper 29, page 19. We

24

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
have not found where Petitioner addresses the “intimate and entirely
coated” limitation. Accordingly, Petitioner has not established how
Saito meets the “intimate and entirely coated” limitation of claim 13.
Patent Owner also argues the separate patentability of other
claims apart from claims 1 and 13. We do not find it necessary to
consider or decide any argument directed to other dependent claims
given that independent claims 1 and 13 have not been shown to be
anticipated.
VI. Analysis—Ground 4 (Obviousness)
A. Issues
Ground 4 raises two issues.
A first issue is whether Patent Owner has sustained its burden
of production to demonstrate that Campbell is not prior art under
§ 102(e).
Assuming Campbell is prior art, a second issue is whether
Petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the
subject matter of claims 1–14 and 16–20 would have been obvious
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over (1) Campbell, (2) Hirota or Saito, and
(3) Stiles.
Based on Petitioner’s reliance on “Hirota or Saito,” we note that
the second issue in fact raises two issues:
(1) patentability based on Campbell, Hirota, and Stiles and
(2) patentability based on Campbell, Saito, and Stiles.
We have determined that neither Hirota nor Saito anticipates
claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent. However, this does not mean that
teachings in Hirota and/or Saito necessarily are irrelevant to

25

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
obviousness. Arkley, 455 F.2d at 589 (“It may well be that [the claim
on appeal] is unpatentable because obvious under § 103 in view of
Flynn, but no such rejection is before us.”).
Patent Owner has attempted to incorporate by reference an
explanation said to appear in its Opposition in IPR2014-01555. Paper 29,
paragraph bridging pages 29–30. Incorporation by reference is not
permitted. 37 C.F.R. § 42.6(a)(3). See also Final Rule, Rules of Practice for
Trials Before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and Judicial Review of
Patent Trial and Appeal Board Decisions, 77 Fed. Reg. 48612, 48617
(Aug. 14, 2012):
The prohibition against incorporation by reference
minimizes the chance that an argument would be
overlooked and eliminates abuses that arise from
incorporation and combination. In DeSilva v. DiLeonardi,
181 F.3d 865, 866–67 (7th Cir. 1999), the court rejected
“adoption by reference” as a self-help increase in the
length of the brief and noted that incorporation is a
pointless imposition on the court’s time as it requires the
judges to play archeologist with the record. The same
rationale applies to Board proceedings.
We decline to consider any argument or other material
incorporated by reference and relating to the Stiles reference.
B. Is Campbell Prior Art?
The involved ʼ758 patent names (1) Eugene D. Guth and
(2) Larry E. Campbell as inventors. Ex. 1001A, page 1.
The Campbell patent names (1) Larry E. Campbell, (2) Robert
Danziger, (3) Eugene D. Guth, and (4) Sally Padron as inventors.
Ex. 1003A, page 1.
Prima facie Campbell is prior art under § 102(e).
26

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
According to Patent Owner, Campbell is not prior art. Why?
Because any relevant discussion in Campbell is said to be a
description of an invention made by the inventors named in the
involved ʼ758 patent, i.e., Larry E. Campbell and Eugene D. Guth.
Eugene D. Guth is deceased. Ex. 2005, ¶ 3.
According to a direct Declaration testimony of Larry E.
Campbell: “Eugene D. Guth and I are the sole inventors of all
inventions claimed in the involved ʼ758 patent [Ex. 1001A].”
Ex. 2005, ¶ 1.
An inventor’s Declaration [i.e., the “oath” required by 35
U.S.C. § 116(a); Ex. 1002A, renumbered page 22] in the application
that matured into the ʼ758 patent prima facie establishes that Larry E.
Campbell and Eugene D. Guth are the inventors of the subject matter
claimed in the involved ’758 patent.
According to the Campbell testimony:
4. Eugene D. Guth and I solely conceived of and
invented the following subject matter disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,451,558 [Ex. 1003A]:
A. The “catalyst absorber, preferably made of
alumina/platinum/carbonate salt, is used to oxidize the
pollutant oxides and absorb them” as disclosed in the
abstract [Ex.1003, page 1].
B. “A material for removing gaseous pollutants
from combustion exhaust comprising an oxidation catalyst
specie selected from platinum, palladium, rhodium, cobalt,
nickel, iron, copper, molybdenum or combination thereof
disposed on a high surface area support, said catalytic
component being intimately and entirely coated with an
absorber selected from a hydroxide, carbonate,

27

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
bicarbonate or mixture thereof of an alkali or alkaline earth
or mixtures thereof” as disclosed and claimed in claim l
[Ex. 1003A, col. 12:30–38].
C.
“After the catalyst absorber is spent or
partially spent, it can be reactivated. Reactivation is
accomplished by removing and replacing the spent
absorber and disposing of the removed spent absorber” as
disclosed [in Ex. 1003A] at column 4, lines 44-47.
Ex. 2005.
Patent Owner did not call Robert Danziger or Sally Padron as a
witnesses. Nor did Patent Owner offer any contemporaneous
documentary evidence in support of the Campbell testimony.
Petitioner did not cross-examine. We draw no adverse
inference from Petitioner’s election not to cross-examine. If a party
believes that an opponent has not made out a case with its testimony,
the party is under no obligation to cross-examine. Cabilly v. Boss,
55 USPQ2d 1238, 1249 (BPAI 1998).
According to Patent Owner, the Campbell testimony establishes
that all the material in the Campbell patent relied upon by Petitioner is
an invention conceived by Campbell and Guth. Paper 29, page 26.
In support of Ground 4, the Petition cites at least the following
portions of Campbell:
(1)

claim 1 (Paper 3, page 45, page 51—claim
chart, page 55—claim chart, page 57—claim

Principles applicable to the antedating issue before us include
those discussed in In re DeBaun, 687 F.2d 459 (CCPA 1982).
DeBaun involved an antedating effort in the context of ex parte
patent examination where there is no adverse party.
The DeBaun facts are similar to those here in that the reference
patent (U.S. Patent 3,842,678) named two inventors (DeBaun and
Noll), whereas the reissue application on appeal named one inventor
(DeBaun). Here, the relied upon Campbell patent names four
inventors, whereas the involved ʼ758 patent names two inventors—
inventors common to the inventors named in the Campbell patent.
In ex parte Rule 132 testimony, DeBaun explained why he was
the inventor of the relevant subject matter described in the reference
patent. To corroborate his testimony, DeBaun relied on a drawing.
DeBaun, 687 F.2d at 461 (citing DeBaun Declaration ¶¶ (a) and (b)).
Specifically, in paragraph (a), reference is made to drawing 73-315
[not reproduced in the CCPA’s opinion], “which . . . [the CCPA found
illustrated] a velocity profile development of an apparatus having
open-ended honeycomb velocity equalizing sections.” Id. In a
29

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
paragraph (c), DeBaun further alleged that “[i]nsofar as the
invention . . . [of the DeBaun application pending on appeal before the
CCPA] is suggested by drawing No. 73-315, or by anything
contained . . . [in the reference DeBaun and Noll patent], it was
originally conceived by me and described to patent counsel. . . .” Id.
at 461–462.
The CCPA stated that the “specific issue raised by this appeal is
an evidentiary one.” Id. at 462. The CCPA also stated that “[t]he
only question raised by the rejection is whether appellant invented the
relevant disclosure in . . . [the DeBaun and Noll reference] patent.”
Id. at 463.
The CCPA made at least two observations in holding that the
evidence was sufficient. First, the CCPA concluded that “[o]n the
basis of the record here, which includes appellant’s unequivocal
declaration that he conceived anything in the . . . [DeBaun and Noll]
patent disclosure which suggests the invention claimed in his . . .
application [on appeal], that question has been satisfactorily
answered.” Id. Second, the CCPA concluded that the Board had
erred “in view of appellant’s showing that the basic equalizer
honeycomb section is appellant’s own invention.” Id. We have
observed that there is a tendency in citing DeBaun for parties to read
too much into the DeBaun opinion by relying just on the first
observation without taking into account the second observation and
the precise facts of the case. As discussed below, DeBaun is limited
to its facts; a significant fact being the presence of contemporaneous
documents. Limiting precedent to its facts is a long-standing principle

30

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
of law in the jurisprudence of the United States. See, e.g., Armour &
Co. v. Wantock, 323 U.S. 126, 132-133 (1944) (“It is timely again to
remind counsel that words of our opinions are to be read in the light of
the facts of the case under discussion.”).
The case before us differs from DeBaun in at least two
significant ways. First, the Campbell testimony does not contain a
paragraph corresponding to DeBaun’s paragraph (c) (DeBaun, 687
F.2d at 461–462). Hence, the unequivocal statement to which the
DeBaun court may have been referring is not present in the case
before us. Second, while DeBaun’s “story” was corroborated with
contemporaneous documentation, i.e., the DeBaun drawing,
Campbell’s “story” is not supported by any contemporaneous
documentation. According to Petitioner, “the Campbell Declaration
(Ex. 2005) is insufficient because there is no accompanying evidence
explaining the inventorship assertions in that declaration.” Paper 40,
page 17. We agree. What we have here is 2015 uncorroborated
testimony by an interested witness about events occurring prior to
1995—a period of at least twenty years.
In assessing the weight to give testimony in a case before us,
we believe three relevant factors include (1) the time period between
events and trial, (2) the interest of the witness, and (3) the absence of
contemporary documentary evidence. Cf. Woodland Trust v.
Flowertree Nursery, Inc., 148 F.3d 1368, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1998)
(citing In re Reuter, 670 F.2d 1015, 1021 n.9 (CCPA 1981)); Sandt
Tech., Ltd. v. Resco Metal and Plastics Corp., 264 F.3d 1344, 1351
(Fed. Cir. 2001). The Sandt court noted that “[b]ecause documentary

31

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
or physical evidence is created at the time of conception . . ., the risk
of litigation-inspired . . . exaggeration is eliminated.” 264 F.3d at
1351. The court further noted that “[i]n contrast to contemporaneous
documentary evidence, however, post-invention oral testimony is
more suspect, as there is more of a risk that the witness may have
litigation-inspired motive to corroborate the inventor’s testimony.”
Id. At the end of the day, “‘all pertinent evidence’ is examined in
order to determine whether the ‘inventor’s story’ is credible.” Id. at
1350.
We also will note that the Campbell testimony sets out specific
subject matter said to be the invention of Larry E. Campbell and
Eugene D. Guth. However, no explanation appears in Patent Owner’s
opposition, or in the Campbell testimony, addressing all of the subject
matter of the Campbell patent upon which Petitioner relies—that
material being identified in paragraphs (1) through (9), supra. Insofar
as we can tell, the Campbell testimony addresses only the subject
matter identified in paragraphs (1), (2), and (8).
We decline to credit the Campbell testimony, principally
because there is no contemporaneous documentary evidence
confirming events taking place a long time ago reported to us via a
witness having an interest in the case.
Because we decline to credit the Campbell testimony, Patent
Owner has failed to carry its burden of production. We therefore hold
that the Campbell patent is prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e).
At oral argument, counsel for Patent Owner called to our
attention an ex parte decision of our Board, Ex parte Griffin, Appeal

32

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
No. 2013-000201 (PTAB Sept. 28, 2015). Transcript of Oral
Argument, Paper 58, page 36:16–page 38:15. The Griffin panel
opinion, Dr. Griffin’s Rule 132 declaration, the first and last page of
Dr. Griffin’s curriculum vitae, and the Mosnier reference relied upon
by the Examiner are made of record in this IPR as Ex. 3002.
According to counsel, the Griffin panel held that a reference
was not prior art based exclusively on an assertion by an inventor that
the subject matter described in the reference was his own invention.
Griffin is not a precedential opinion of our Board. In any event, and
more importantly, there are significant differences between the ex parte
Griffin proceeding and an inter partes review proceeding. In an ex parte
proceeding the PTO may accept an unequivocal statement of an application.
MPEP § 716.10. An ex parte proceeding is not adversarial. On the other
hand, an inter partes review trial is by definition an inter partes adversarial
proceeding in which a petitioner does not have to accept a non-corroborated
allegation of inventorship.
Harkening back to the Supreme Court’s admonition in Armour, the
Griffin panel found that the reference sought to be eliminated stated “[w]e
thank Dr. Andy Gale (Scripps Research Institute) for providing S360AAPC . . . Stimulating discussions with Dr. Gale and Dr. Berilav Zlokovic are
gratefully acknowledged.” See Ex. 3002, Griffin at page 5 (finding of fact 8)
and Mosnier (the reference), page 69, near bottom of column 1. The
acknowledgment of Mosnier was not lost on the Griffin panel. Ex. 3002,
Griffin at page 8:4–7. The acknowledgement statement is consistent with
Dr. Gale having not invented subject matter described by Mosnier. No
corresponding acknowledgment is present in this case.

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
C. Prima Facie Obviousness
1. Scope and Content of the Prior Art
(a) Campbell
Campbell states:
After the catalyst absorber is spent or partially spent, it can
be reactivated. Reactivation is accomplished by removing
and replacing the spent absorber and disposing of the
removed spent absorber.
Ex. 1003[A], col. 4:44–47.
(b) Hirota
Figures 1A and 3 of Hirota are reproduced below.

Depicted in Figure 1A is a prior art regenerating apparatus.

34

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758

Hirota Fig. 3
Depicted in Figure 3 is a schematic drawing of a Hirota regenerating
apparatus.
According to Hirota:
a [prior art] regenerating process is carried out by
introducing the reducing agent while the exhaust gas
flowing into the vessel is cut off.
By cutting off the exhaust gas flowing into the vessel, it is
theoretically considered that, in the above method, the
amount of the reducing agent required for the regenerating
process can be reduced to a sum of the amount required to
consume the oxygen content in the exhaust gas remaining
in the vessel and the amount required for reducing the NOx
released from the NOx absorbent.
However, the amount actually required for the
regenerating process in the above method becomes much
larger than the above theoretical value. This problem is
explained with reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B. . . . In FIG.
1A, reference numeral 2 represents an exhaust passage of
35

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
the diesel engine, and 3 represents a vessel containing a
NOx absorbent 1 connected to the exhaust passage 2.
Numeral 5 represents an exhaust shutter valve disposed in
the exhaust passage 2 upstream of the vessel 3 to cut off
the exhaust gas flowing into the vessel, and 4 represents a
nozzle of the reducing agent supply device for supplying
a reducing agent to the NOx absorbent 1 during the
regenerating process.
As explained above, the exhaust shutter valve 5 is closed
during the regenerating process in this method, and the
reducing agent is supplied from the nozzle 4 under the
condition in which no exhaust gas flow exists in the vessel
3. Because of the absence of the gas flow carrying the
reducing agent, the reducing agent supplied from the
nozzle 4 stays in the region near the nozzle 4 and forms a
mass of a high concentration reduction agent. This
reduction agent progressively diffuses in the vessel, and as
time passes, a uniform mixture of the exhaust gas remains
in the vessel and the reducing agent is formed. However,
in the absence of the gas flow in the vessel, it takes a long
time for the reducing agent to diffuse over the entire
volume of the vessel. This causes an increase in the time
required for the regenerating process to a level not
practically acceptable.
Ex. 1006A, col. 2:1–45.
The prior art apparatus described by Hirota, like Campbell,
must shut off exhaust in order to regenerate. Ex. 1003A, col. 5:60–61
(“After the catalyst absorber is exhausted or saturated, it can be
regenerated.”).
To overcome its identified problem, Hirota describes its
Figure 3 embodiment:
FIG. 3 schematically illustrates . . . [an]
embodiment of the exhaust gas purification device

36

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
according to the [Hirota] present invention. In FIG. 3,
reference numeral 10 designates an internal combustion
engine which is operated on a lean air-fuel ratio, and 2
designates an exhaust passage of the engine 10. In this
embodiment, the exhaust passage 2 diverges into two
branch exhaust passages 2a and 2b, and exhaust shutter
valves 6a and 6b are disposed on the branch exhaust
passages 2a and 2b, respectively. Also, vessels 3a and 3b
containing NOx absorbents 1a and 1b are disposed on the
branch exhaust passages 2a and 2b downstream of the
exhaust shutter valves 6a and 6b. Further, on the branch
exhaust passages 2a and 2b between the exhaust shutter
valves 6a, 6b and the vessels 3a, 3b, nozzles 4a and 4b of
the reducing agent supply device 4 are provided for
supplying reducing agent to the NOx absorbents 1a and 1b.
The NOx absorbents 1a and 1b contained in the
vessels 3a and 3b use, for example, alumina as a carrier,
and on this carrier, precious metals such as platinum, and
at least one substance selected from alkali metals such as
potassium K, sodium Na, lithium Li and cesium Cs; alkaliearth metals such as barium Ba and calcium Ca; and rareearth metals such as lanthanum La and yttrium Y are
carried. The NOx absorbents 1a and 1b absorb NOx in the
inflowing exhaust gas when the air-fuel ratio of the
inflowing exhaust gas is lean, and release the absorbed
NOx when the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas in
the vessels 3a and 3b becomes lower.
Ex. 1006A, col. 5:1–29.
With respect to the operation of the Hirota Figure 3
embodiment, Hirota teaches:
Next, the operation of the exhaust gas purification
device in FIG. 3 will be explained.
In this embodiment, the regeneration of the NOx
absorbents 1a and 1b is carried out alternately. Namely,

37

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
in the normal operation, one of the exhaust shutter valves
6a and 6b (for example, 6a) is fully opened and the exhaust
gas from the engine 10 passes through the NOx absorbent
1a, and the NOx in the exhaust gas is absorbed in the NOx
absorbent 1a. After absorbing the NOx in the exhaust gas
for a predetermined time, the exhaust shutter valve 6a is
closed and the exhaust shutter valve 6b is fully opened so
that the exhaust gas from the engine 10 passes through the
NOx absorbent 1b, thus the NOx in the exhaust gas is
absorbed in the NOx absorbent 1b. At the same time, a
predetermined amount of the reducing agent is injected
into the branch exhaust passage 2a upstream of the NOx
absorbent 1a from the nozzle 4a of the reducing agent
supply device 4 to regenerate the NOx absorbent 1a.
Ex. 1006A, col. 7:18–36.
(c) Saito
Figure 1 of Saito is reproduced below.

Saito Fig. 1
Depicted in Figure 1 is an example of the Saito invention
A specific usage example is shown in FIG. 1.
1-a and 1-b are catalysts that oxidize and absorb
NOX, which are arranged in parallel; and 3 is a switching
38

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
valve, which guides the exhaust gas from the engine to
either catalyst bed 1-a or 1-b.
After [the exhaust gas] has been introduced to one
of the catalyst beds for a fixed period of time, [the exhaust
gas] is introduced to the other catalyst bed by way of the
switching valve. In cases where hydrogen has been
selected as the gaseous reducing agent, hydrogen
generated by a hydrogen generation device 2 is introduced
to the catalyst bed through which exhaust gas is not
flowing.
The hydrogen that is output from the hydrogen
generation device 2 is sent to a hydrogen reservoir 5, and
introduced to the target catalyst bed by way of a switching
valve 4.
It is preferable that the hydrogen reservoir 5 be
packed with a substance having the capacity to retain
hydrogen such as a hydrogen storage metal. When the
hydrogen is to be output, the heat of the exhaust gas can
be used, or heating by way of electric heating can be used.
Furthermore, a check valve 7 is provided to prevent
backflow of the hydrogen from the hydrogen reservoir 5
to the electrolysis tank 2.
Ex. 1008A, page 3, col. 1:60–col. 2:20.
(d) Stiles
Stiles describes an adsorbent regenerated in situ:
The adsorbed nitrogen oxides, after a period of adsorption,
are removed from the adsorbent by regeneration for reuse
of the adsorbent. The adsorbent will remove the nitrogen
oxides to the extent of 100% at a space velocity exceeding
15,000 and a temperature in the range of 150°–300° C. or
above. The nitrogen oxides can be quickly reduced in situ
or be evolved from the adsorbent as a concentrated stream
by passing a gas containing N2 plus 0.5 to 10% hydrogen
39

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
at a temperature of 300° to 350° C. over the saturated
adsorbent. The nitrogen oxides in the concentrated stream
are reduced to nitrogen and water at this temperature.
Ex. 1009A, col. 4:18–30.
Stiles further teaches:
The adsorbent now containing more than 0.2% NOx by
weight . . . [can be] regenerated for reuse by passing a gas
containing from .05 to 10% hydrogen in nitrogen; both
carbon dioxide and water vapor can also be present.
Ex. 1009A, col. 5:52–55.
Stiles still further teaches that “the adsorbent can be utilized
repeatedly in the adsorption-desorption cycle without loss of
effectiveness.” Ex. 1009A, col. 4:34–36.
(b) Differences
We noted, in instituting an inter partes trial, that the Petition and
Dr. Farrauto do not identify in the clearest of terms the differences between
the subject matter of ʼ758 patent claim 1 and Campbell. Paper 19, page 11.
Dr. Farrauto testified that “Campbell need[s] improvement, because
once the absorbent becomes NOx –saturated, it is discarded.” Ex. 1010A,
¶ 35. See also Petition, page 47:1–7.
Whenever a ground based on obviousness is involved, the preferred
manner of setting out differences is to state “the subject matter of claim x
differs from the reference in that (1) …, (2) …., and (n) ….” Vague
statements or hints of differences not only burdens the Board, but puts a
patent owner at somewhat of a disadvantage with having to guess what any
differences a petitioner believes may exit. Reluctance on the part of counsel
to “admit” to and identify a difference is hard to understand, given the fact
40

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
that a difference does not mean the subject matter claimed is non-obvious.
Dann v. Johnston, 425 U.S. 219, 230 (1976) (mere existence of differences
between the prior art and an invention does not establish the invention’s
non-obviousness).4
Campbell appears to differ from the subject matter of claim 1 of
the ʼ758 patent in that Campbell does not describe an in situ
regeneration.
3. Level of Skill in the Art
In our view, the prior art reveals the level of skill in the art.
4. Discussion
While Campbell does not describe in situ regeneration, and
assuming arguendo that claim 1 of the ʼ758 patent requires in situ
regeneration, in situ regeneration is a well-known technique described
by Saito and Stiles.
An in situ regeneration in Campbell makes sense because it
eliminates a need to discard spent catalyst and permits one skilled in
the art to reuse catalytic material. The reuse of catalytic material
would have been recognized as significant due to the expense of
platinum. Ex. 1056, page 13:20–23.
Patent Owner maintains that the catalytic material of Saito and
Stiles “is very different from that of the ʼ758 patent.” Paper 29,

Petitioner’s failure to clearly identify differences is not consistent with
37 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(4) and 42.104(b)(5), as well as 35 U.S.C. § 312(a)(3),
which require identifying the grounds “with particularity.” The Petition must
specify where each element of a challenged claim is found in the prior art
patents or printed publications. 37 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2).
4

41

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
page 29. “There is nothing in either Saito or Stiles to suggest . . . that
the regeneration methods of these two references might be succesfully
used for regenerating the catalyst/absorber of Campbell.” Id. at
page 30.
Patent Owner’s argument amounts to individual attacks on each of the
prior art references. In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413 (CCPA 1981). By attacking
each reference individually, Patent Owner runs head-on into an admonition
in KSR that a person having ordinary skill in the art is not an automaton.
KSR, 550 U.S. at 421. Unexplained by Patent Owner, is why one skilled in
the art, in the face of Saito and Stiles, would not have found it obvious to use
an in situ regeneration process in a Campbell environment to avoid
discarding spent catalyst.
Assuming arguendo that the catalysts of Saito and Stiles are different
from those described by Campbell, one skilled in the art would have
appreciated that the regeneration technique described by those references,
i.e., the device illustrated in Figure 1 of Saito, would have been equally
applicable for regenerating in the Campbell environment.
We therefore agree with Petitioner that:
[Campbell, Saito and Stiles] establish that . . .
challenged . . . [claim 1] cover[s] a process in which all
ingredients are known and being used for their intended
purpose in a known manner to achieve an entirely
expected result -- regeneration of a spent catalyst absorber.
KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007).
Paper 40, page 21.
Patent Owner addresses other arguments related to claim 1, as
well as the separate patentability of several claims apart from claim 1.

42

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
Claim 1
Patent Owner maintains that the combination of Campbell and
Hirota do not support a finding that the combination describes an inert
carrier gas. Paper 29, page 32. We agree, principally because as we
held earlier in this opinion, Hirota has not been shown to describe an
inert carrier gas. Hirota need not be relied upon when analyzing
obviousness vis-à-vis the prior art combination of Campbell, Saito,
and Stiles.
According to Patent Owner, the combination of Campbell and
Saito fails to provide a necessary reason for using the in situ
regeneration of Saito in a Campbell environment. Paper 29, page 32.
We disagree. For the reasons given above, one skilled in the art
would have recognized the value of in situ regeneration in a Campbell
environment apart from the catalyst/absorber described by Saito.
Claim 2
Patent Owner notes that claim 2 also requires a carrier gas and
that Hirota does not describe a carrier gas. We need not analyze
Hirota to resolve obviousness based on the prior art combination of
Campbell, Saito, and Stiles.
Patent Owner also notes that claim 2 calls for a temperature in the
range of 250 ºC – 750 ºC. Patent Owner calls our attention to the fact that
Saito describes “a temperature range that overlaps with, but far exceeds the
range of claim 2.” Paper 29, page 32. In support of its argument, Patent
Owner does not state the temperature ranges. We note that Saito describes a
temperature range of from 150 ºC – 800 ºC, and in particular, 200 ºC – 700
ºC. Ex. 1008B, page 4:15–16 and 38–39. We view Patent Owner’s “far

43

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
exceeds” to be somewhat of an overstatement. In any event, Patent Owner
has failed to establish that the difference in ranges is significant.
Overlapping ranges generally support a prima facie case of obviousness. In
re Peterson, 315 F.3d 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (a prima facie case of
obviousness typically exists when the ranges of a claimed composition
overlap the ranges disclosed in the prior art).
Claim 3
Claim 3 calls for a regenerating gas comprising up to 10% carbon
dioxide. According to Patent Owner, Saito describes the presence of carbon
dioxide in the exhaust gas, but not the regeneration gas. Paper 29, page 33;
Saito, Ex. 1008B, page 4:17. Overlooked, and not addressed by Patent
Owner, is a description of the use of carbon dioxide in a reducing gas
described by Stiles. Ex. 1009A, col. 5:52–55 (“[t]he absorbent . . . is
regenerated for reuse by passing a gas containing . . . hydrogen in nitrogen;
both carbon dioxide and water vapor can also be present”).
Claim 13
Patent Owner argues that Saito is defective because Saito is not
concerned with restoring a carbonate form of the absorber. Paper 29,
page 33. Patent Owner’s argument overlooks the fact that it is the Campbell
catalyst that is to be regenerated using the in situ regeneration technique
taught by Saito. The fact that Saito’s catalyst is different is not controlling.
It is the combination of using Saito’s known in situ regeneration technique
in the Campbell environment that renders regeneration of the carbonate form
obvious to one skilled in the art.
According to Patent Owner, “Saito . . . fails to teach the addition of
CO [carbon monoxide] or CO2 [carbon dioxide] if hydrogen, the preferred

44

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
reducing agent . . . is used as the reducing agent.” Paper 29, pages 33–34.
Saito teaches the use of “ordinary reducing agents such as hydrogen,
ammonia, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, such as methane, and the like . . .
[with] hydrogen is the most preferred.” Ex. 1008B, page 4: col. 1:27–31.
Claim 13 calls for the use, inter alia, of a reducing agent selected from
carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas. A reference is not limited to its
preferred embodiment. Saito manifestly teaches the use of carbon
monoxide. See also Stiles, Ex. 1009A, col. 5:52-55 (teaching the use of
hydrogen where carbon dioxide can also be present).
Claims 16 and 20
Claims 16 and 20 require steam to be present in the carrier gas.
Paper 29, pages 34–35. While agreeing that Saito describes the use of steam
in the exhaust gas, Patent Owner maintains that Saito does not describe the
presence of steam in the regeneration gas. Id. Overlooked by Patent Owner
is a teaching in Stiles that the regeneration gas can contain “water vapor.”
Ex. 1009A, col. 5:55. What is clear from the record is that the regeneration
gas can contain hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor per
Stiles and hydrogen, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons per
Saito. Selection of a particular gas has not been shown to be beyond the
skill in this art. In fact, we note that selection of a particular gas appears to
be a function of the reduction process undertaken. Ex. 1009A, col. 1:58–63
(discussing use of ammonia in an SCR process).
Claim 17
Claim 17 calls for an inert reducing gas comprising about 500 ppm to
10% hydrogen. Stiles describes the use of a reducing gas having 0.05 to
10% hydrogen. Ex. 1009A, col. 5:54. Patent Owner thus is using a known

45

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
amount of hydrogen in a reducing gas to achieve an expected and intended
result.
D. Other Considerations
According to Patent Owner, evidence of a long-felt need and
commercial success trumps any prima facie case of obviousness. Paper 28,
pages 35–42.
A long-felt need and post-invention commercial success can tip the
balance in favor of non-obviousness, both in the courts and the PTO. Eibel
Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co., 261 U.S. 45 (1923);
Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U.S. 403 (1902); The Barbed
Wire Patent, 143 U.S. 275 (1892); Webster Loom v. Higgins, 105 U.S. 580
(1881); Ex parte Artsana USA, Inc., Appeal 2014-004116, 2014 WL
4090808 (PTAB Aug. 18, 2014); Murata Mfg. Co. v. Synqor, Inc., Appeal
2014-001167, 2014 WL 1397381 (PTAB Apr. 10, 2014); Ex parte
Whirlpool Corp., Appeal 2013-008232, 2013 WL 5866602 (PTAB Oct. 30,
2013). However, in this case, we are unable to credit much, if any, weight,
to Patent Owner’s evidence of long-felt need and commercial success. For
long-felt need and commercial success to be convincing, there must be a
“nexus” between (1) the long-felt need/commercial success and (2) the
claimed subject matter. In re Fielder, 471 F.2d 640, 646 (CCPA 1973).
Patent Owner’s evidence is bottomed on Patent Owner’s experience
with what is referred to as a “SCONOx catalytic absorption system.”
Ex. 2006A ¶ 4 (direct Declaration testimony of Thomas Girdlestone).
Patent Owner characterizes the claimed method as embodying a
SCONOx system. Paper 29, page 37:3–4.

46

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
According to Mr. Girdlestone, the effectiveness of reducing NOx
in a SCONOx system was tested at a turbine facility run at EmeraChem’s
then-affiliate Sunlaw Energy in California. Ex. 2006A, ¶ 5.
Further according to Mr. Girdlestone, both the EPA and the Cal EPA
found impressive a reduction of NOx pollutants from 5–9 ppm to 1–2 ppm.
Ex. 2006A, ¶¶ 5–10.
Without getting into specific confidential commercial numbers,
Mr. Girdlestone testified that Patent Owner received considerable revenue
from licensing agreements to various entities. However, missing from
Patent Owner’s story is any market share information. We therefore cannot
meaningfully assess the weight to be given to Patent Owner’s revenues.
Petitioner argues that Patent Owner has not established a necessary
nexus between Patent Owner’s commercial activities and the claimed
invention. Paper 40, pages 21–22 (“Patent Owner has not shown . . . how its
SCONOx regeneration process embodies each and every limitation of
claim 1” of the ’758 patent).
We have not been directed to testimony comparing the SCONOx
process performed at Sunlaw Energy in California vis-à-vis the subject
matter of the claims of the ʼ758 patent.
On cross-examination, Mr. Girdlestone testified:
Q. [by counsel for Petitioner] Did you review these patents
during your preparation of the Declaration [Ex. 2006A]?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Do you consider yourself qualified to determine
whether the use of a catalyst absorber satisfies all the
limitations of a claim in the . . . 911 patent?

47

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
A. Probably no.
Q. Why do you say that?
A. Well, when it comes to the -- these are based on a lot of
science and chemistry. I understand the inputs and the
outputs, but everything in between the inputs and outputs
as to the fundamental drivers of the chemistry, I'm not an
expert in that. And as for the administration prosecution - legal prosecution, I’m not an attorney. I’m not an expert
on that. My job is to make sure this work was done, it was
done on time, it was done on budget. And to assess value
to it as compared to the application that we want to apply
this technology to on the commercial set. I’m mostly on
the commercial side of business.
Ex. 1057, page 17:4–25.
Insofar as we are aware, Dr. Crocker did not testify on whether
any SCONOx testing was consistent with the claims of the ʼ758
patent.
We have not been told which claim, if any, is limited to the alleged
commercially successful embodiment tested at Sunlaw Energy in California.
In re Tiffin, 448 F.2d 791 (CCPA 1971) (on rehearing, CCPA held that
evidence of commercial success must be commensurate in scope with the
breadth of the claims); In re Law, 303 F.2d 951, 954 (CCPA 1962) (same).
We also find Patent Owner’s long-felt need analysis unconvincing.
First, we have not been told when a need first arose to reduce NOx
emissions. Second, assuming it arose sometime not too long before 1997, it
does not appear that it took long to solve the problem. Third, no evidence
has been directed to our attention confirming that those trying to solve the
problem were aware of either Saito or Stiles. In re Allen, 324 F.2d 993, 997

48

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
(CCPA 1963) (while appellant’s arguments imply that there may have been
an unsolved problem in the art, an allegation to this effect is not evidence of
unobviousness unless it is shown, as was not done here, that [1] the
widespread efforts of [2] skilled workers [3] having knowledge of the prior
art [4] had failed to find a solution to the problem (citing Toledo Pressed
Steel Co. v. Standard Parts, Inc., 307 U.S. 350, 356 (1939) (it does not
appear that those trying to solve the problem were familiar with the relevant
prior art))).
E. Prima facie Obviousness vis-à-vis Secondary Consideration
For reasons given above, in this case we decline to accord much, if
any, weight to Patent Owner’s evidence of long-felt need and commercial
success.
When the secondary consideration evidence is weighed vis-à-vis the
prima facie case of obviousness, we believe the balance favors the prima
facie case.
Accordingly, we hold that Petitioner’s evidence establishes by a
preponderance that the subject matter of claims 1–14 and 16–20 of the ʼ758
patent would have been obvious within the meaning of § 103.
VII. Motions to Exclude
A. Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude
Patent Owner “moves to exclude portions of Petitioner’s Reply
(Paper Nos. 39, 40) as presenting new issues for the time in a Reply.”
Paper 45, page 1.
Petitioner has opposed. Paper 52.
A motion to exclude should be limited to seeking to exclude
“evidence,” not arguments in a reply.
49

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
We therefore treat Patent Owner’s motion to exclude as a motion to
expunge part or all of Petitioner’s Reply.
According to Patent Owner, Petitioner has raised new arguments in its
Reply related to the issue of whether Saito anticipates challenged claims of
the ʼ758 patent.
We have determined that Petitioner has failed to establish that Saito
anticipates any challenged claim, even if the entire Reply is considered.
Because Patent Owner has prevailed on the issue of whether Saito
anticipates any challenged claims, the issue raised in Patent Owner’s Motion
to Exclude need not be decided.
Patent Owner’s Motion to Exclude is dismissed as moot.
B. Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude
Petitioner moves to exclude Exhibit 3 forming part of the direct
declaration testimony of Thomas Girdlestone (Ex. 2006). Paper 47.
Patent Owner has opposed. Paper 52.
Petitioner has replied. Paper 54.
1.
In view of our analysis for not crediting Patent Owner’s commercial
success evidence, we have not found it necessary in this opinion to identify
specific sales figures.
As to Exhibit 3, the Motion to Exclude is dismissed as moot.
2.
Petitioner objects to certain Girdlestone testimony as hearsay
(Paper 47, page 4) and for lack of authentication (Paper 47, page 7).

50

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
In view of the basis upon which we have declined to credit Patent
Owner’s evidence of commercial success, we have not found it necessary to
consider the objected to testimony.
As to the objected to testimony, the Motion to Exclude is dismissed as
moot.
C.
We will also note that, to a large extent, the Motion to Exclude
amounts to supplementing argument on the merits, thereby impermissibly
extending page limits for other documents.
VIII. Sealed Documents
In reaching our decisions, we have not found it necessary to rely on
any redacted portion of the public documents.
The parties should promptly move to expunge all documents filed
under seal.
IX. Large Documents
The parties have filed several large documents, i.e., documents
containing many pages.
An example is the prosecution history of the involved ʼ758 patent
(Ex. 1002).
At oral argument, the following discussion took place emphasizing
why merely placing a large document in the record without citing to specific
pages of the documents, only to later rely for the first time on a non-cited
portion of the document at oral argument or on appeal, is not appropriate.
[Mr. Bradford, counsel for Patent Owner] Now, the ʼ758 patent,
if you turn to exhibit -- or slide 5 of our demonstrative, the file
history for ʼ758 shows that when it was filed there was a
51

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
regeneration method, and, it says 10 months later, this is very
soon thereafter, the slide 5 shows claim 1, and then very
specifically the same dependent claim, almost exact
dependent -- or very similar dependent claims were included.
Claim 9 says explicitly there is an alkali or alkaline earth
carbonate.
JUDGE McKELVEY: Now, were these arguments made in the
opposition?
MR. BRADFORD: Well, they are in the record.
JUDGE McKELVEY: So I'm trying to figure out how -- you put
your proofs in and then they are supposed to respond to it -- I'm
trying to figure out how they respond to what you are just
addressing right now?
MR. BRADFORD: Well, this is evidence that they have had in
the record.
JUDGE McKELVEY: Well, but it is not their job to go looking
through the record to make your case out, nor is it ours. So if
you come to oral argument and you lay out these options, how
are they supposed to have answered that?
MR. BRADFORD: Well, Your Honor, I mean, this is clear on
the face that these are just the inventors of the two patents. They
said they invented this. And this corroborates -- the claims in the
'758 patent corroborate that they invented it. They include the
specific catalyst as dependent claims in the claims. I mean, it is
evident whenever they are saying we invented this that it is
included in both patents. I mean, we didn't make this explicit
citation to the record, but they did. It is clear, just by looking at
the claims, they said they invented them.
JUDGE McKELVEY: See, this is one of the problems of putting
in a file wrapper and not identifying specific pages, because you
will find at the end of our decision when it comes out that pages
not cited to us in the documents are excluded from evidence,
52

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
because what happens is somebody goes on appeal and starts
making a new argument based on evidence that neither the
Petitioner had an opportunity to look at and comment on the
reply or we did. And the court doesn't particularly like that sort
of thing.
See Transcript of Oral Argument, Paper 58, page 32:15 through page 34:6.
We decline to consider an argument made for the first time at oral
argument based on portions of a large document not cited in the Petition,
Opposition, or Reply.
With respect to these large documents, we have considered only the
pages called to our attention by the parties or mentioned in our opinion.
All other pages were not considered and are deemed not to have been
admitted into evidence.
X. Order
Upon consideration of the Petition (Paper 3), Opposition (Paper 29),
and Reply (Paper 40), and for the reasons given, it is
ORDERED that based on Ground 1 (Hirota), the evidence does not
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that any challenged claim is
unpatentable;
FURTHER ORDERED that based on Ground 2 (Takeshima), the
evidence does not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that any
challenged claim is unpatentable;
FURTHER ORDERED that based on Ground 3 (Saito), the evidence
does not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that any challenged
claim is unpatentable;

53

IPR2014-01558
Patent 5,599,758
FURTHER ORDERED that based on Ground 4 (obviousness), the
evidence establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 1–14
and 16–20 of the ʼ758 patent are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
FURTHER ORDERED that because this is a final written decision,
parties to the proceeding seeking judicial review of the decision must
comply with the notice and service requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 90.2.
