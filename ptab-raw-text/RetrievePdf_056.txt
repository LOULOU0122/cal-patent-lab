UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE
BEFORE THE PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD
APPLE INC.,
Petitioner,
v.
ZIILABS INC.,
Patent Owner.
Case IPR2015-00931
Patent 5,835,096

Before GLENN J. PERRY, TREVOR M. JEFFERSON, and
MICHAEL J. FITZPATRICK, Administrative Patent Judges.
JEFFERSON, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION
Granting Joint Motion to Terminate
35 U.S.C. § 317(a) and 37 C.F.R. §§ 42.72, 42.74
On November 16, 2015, and pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 317(a), the
parties filed a joint motion to terminate IPR2015-00931. Paper 10. Along
with the joint motion, the parties filed a Settlement and License Agreement
(Ex. 1025, “settlement agreement”). The parties represent that they fully
resolved all disputes regarding U.S. Patent No. 5,835,096 (“the ’096 Patent”)
“via a written agreement.” Paper 10, 2 (citing Ex. 1025, 1–12). The parties

IPR2015-00931
Patent 5,835,096
note, in particular, that their resolution of disputes regarding the ’096 Patent
includes this proceeding and disputes between the parties pending in related
case ZiiLabs Inc., Ltd. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Case No. 2:14-cv0203 (E.D. Tex.). Id. at 2–3. Id. The parties further represent that Exhibit
1025 is a true and correct copy of the aforementioned “written agreement.”
Id.
This proceeding is at an early stage in that Patent Owner has not yet
filed a Patent Owner Response. In view of the early stage of this
proceeding, and the concurrent settlement of the dispute between the parties
regarding the ’096 Patent pending in the district court lawsuit, we determine
that it is appropriate to terminate the proceeding with respect to both parties.
See 37 C.F.R. § 42.72. Therefore, the joint motion to terminate this
proceeding is granted. This paper does not constitute a final written decision
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a).
The parties also filed in each case a joint request that the settlement
agreement be treated as business confidential information pursuant to 35
U.S.C. § 317(b) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.74(c). Paper 11. We grant the parties’
request.
ORDER
Accordingly, it is:
ORDERED that the parties’ joint request that the settlement
agreement be treated as business confidential information, to be kept
separate from the patent file, is granted; and
FURTHER ORDERED that the joint motion to terminate IPR201500931 is granted, and this inter partes review is hereby terminated.
