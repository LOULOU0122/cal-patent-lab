REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on appellants’ request for rehearing

of our earlier decision entered May 29, 2001, wherein we

affirmed the examiner's rejections of the appealed claims

under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103. This decision is rendered subsequent to the oral

hearing dated July 12, 2001 consistent with appellants’

request in the Request for Rehearing dated June 15, 2001.

Appeal No. 1997-4283
Application No. 08/342,695

We have carefully considered the arguments raised by
appellants in the Request for Rehearing. However, we are not
persuaded by those arguments to alter our earlier decision
entered May 29, 2001.

Initially, we note that appellants argue that we
overlooked dependent claims 2 and 3 which were separately
argued at page 8, lines 3-10, of the Brief. See the Request
for Rehearing, page 2. However, we are not persuaded that
those claims are separately patentable over the applied prior
art. As indicated in our earlier decision, appellants have
not timely challenged the examiner's determination that
“[a]ppellants do not provide reasons why each appealed claim
is considered separately patentable [over the applied prior
art]." See, e.g., Reply Brief. Thus, we determine that the
patentability of those claims stands or falls together with
the patentability of claim 13.

Even were we to consider those claims separately, our
conclusion will not be changed. As acknowledged by appellants
(Brief, page 5), the applied prior art references, namely
Kurofuchi and Yonezawa, teach employing less than or equal to

5000 ppm strontium or less than or equal to 150 ppm strontium,

which are all inclusive of the amount of strontium recited in
claim 2. Moreover, the applied prior art references, namely
Latkowski, Kurofuchi and Yonezawa, teach employing the amount
of zirconium recited in claim 3. Thus, it would have been
prima facie obvious to employ workable or optimum proportions
of strontium and/or zirconium in the aluminum alloy described

or suggested in the applied prior art. See In re Malagari,

499 F.2d 1297, 1303, 182 USPQ 549, 553 (CCPA 1974).

Appellants also argue that we overlooked the sufficiency
of the Koch declaration in rebutting the prima facie cases
established by the examiner. However, we are not persuaded of
any error on our part for the reasons set forth at pages 5 and
6 of our earlier decision. We find that appellants have not
evinced either directly or indirectly that the claimed entire
concentration ranges of Magnesium and Manganese are shown to
be critical. See In re Clemens, 622 F.2d 1029, 1035, 206 USPQ
289, 296 (CCPA 1980). Nor have appellants evinced that the
showing limited to a single aluminum alloy having specific
proportions of silicon, magnesium, manganese, strontium,

aluminum, iron, copper, zinc and titanium is sufficient to

support the myriad of alloys covered by the appealed claims.
Clemens, 622 F.2d at 1035, 206 USPQ at 296. Appellants have
not demonstrated that the unexpected improvements attributable
to the alloy tested in the Koch declaration are attributable
to those claimed alloys containing either no or only some of
strontium, iron, copper, zinc, titanium and zirconium. The
need for a broader and more representative showing is even
more compelling in view of appellants’ own argument regarding
the effect of the presence of certain proportions of certain
alloy components, such as zirconium and strontium, in the
claimed alloy. See Brief, page 8.
In view of the foregoing, appellants’ request for

rehearing is granted to the extent of reconsidering our
earlier decision entered May 29, 2001, but is denied with

respect to making any changes thereto.
