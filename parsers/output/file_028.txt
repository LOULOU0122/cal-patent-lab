ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants filed a request for rehearing on August 23,
2000 responsive to a decision by the Board mailed on June 23,
2000. In that decision, the Board affirmed the rejection of
claims 1-6, 19 and 21, and reversed the rejection of claims 7-
15 and 17. Appellants request that we reconsider that portion

of

1 Administrative Patent Judge Frahm, who authored the

original decision, is no longer at the Board.

the decision of June 23, 2000 wherein the Board affirmed the
rejection of claims 1-6, 19 and 21 as unpatentable under
35 U.S.C. § 103.

We have reconsidered the decision of June 23, 2000 in
light of appellants’ comments in the request for rehearing,
and we find no errors therein. We, therefore, decline to make
any changes in the prior decision for the reasons which
follow.

The request for rehearing initially points to supposed
errors made by the Board in affirming the rejection of claims
1-6. Claims 1-6 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being
unpatentable over the teachings of Tsujino and Fukuyama.
Appellants argue that the Board failed to consider the proper
meaning of the word “set” when viewed in light of the
disclosure. Specifically, appellants argue that the term
“set” means a “pre-specified tool is or is not present"
[request, page 3]. The earlier decision relied on Tsujino for
teaching this recitation of independent claim 1. Appellants
argue that a “tool set condition displaying means” cannot be
met by the types of tool parameters described by Tsujino or

Fukuyama. We do not agree.

Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

First, we note that the definition proposed by
appellants is not mandated by any special definition set forth
in the specification. Second, Tsujino does not simply
disclose tool parameters such as length, diameter and offset,
but also discloses the ability to identify or discriminate the
type of tool within the tool holder. This discrimination in
Tsujino is done for the same purpose disclosed by appellants
which is to prevent the use of the wrong tool. Tsujino states
that “the tool to be carried to the spindle 3 by the tool
changing apparatus 4 is checked by the receiver 30 arranged at
the position B to see if it is the designated proper tool or
not. Therefore, it is possible to prevent that the workpiece
is erroneously worked by use of the improper tool" [column 7,
lines 10-15]. Thus, Tsujino determines if a tool located in
the tool holder is the correct tool for the job. The data for
identifying the tool is “set condition” data within the
meaning of the claims. The earlier decision agreed with the
examiner that displaying machine tool data was well known as
evidenced by Fukuyama. We still agree with the examiner's

conclusion that it would have been obvious within the meaning

Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

of 35 U.S.C. § 103 to display any tool identifying information
of Tsujino as taught by Fukuyama.
We now consider the Board's earlier decision with
respect to claims 19 and 21 which were rejected under 35
U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over admitted prior art in
view of Takeuchi. With respect to claim 19, appellants’
arguments are directed to the workpiece data set indicating
means. This means is recited for stopping a program,
displaying workpiece data, or prompting an operator. In the
earlier decision, the Board noted that this element was
satisfied by prior art which performs any one of the three
claimed functions, and the Board considered that Takeuchi
taught at least the function of stopping. Appellants argue
that the stopping function is not performed by Takeuchi
because there is no affirmative action taken to stop the
processing of the program and nothing inherently requires the
program in Takeuchi to stop when the data runs out [request,
pages 5-6].
Although the Board considered only the claimed

function of stopping and found stopping in Takeuchi when the

data runs out, we find that Takeuchi teaches much more than




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

the original panel considered. Specifically, Takeuchi teaches
an affirmative action of not moving a tool to the machining
center when the data is inaccurate [note column 9, lines 28-
32]. As noted in Takeuchi, the movement of the defective
pallet is inhibited. We view such inhibition of movement as
an action of stopping processing of a program. We also view
such stopping as a stopping when necessary workpiece data has
not been set in said workpiece fixing means as recited in
claim 19.

We are also of the view that Takeuchi teaches the
prompting function of claim 19. Takeuchi states that “[i]f
the normal data cannot be received even after the resending
operation was requested a predetermined number of times, the
CPU 30 of the write/readout unit 25 turns on the error
indicator 72, thereby instructing the checking by the
operator” [column 8, lines 13-17]. Such an indication to the
operator would have suggested the claimed prompting of an
operator to set workpiece data.

With respect to claim 21, the Board in the earlier
decision observed that the claimed position and height data of

each workpiece was conventional information that would have

5




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

been obvious to store in the admitted prior art and Takeuchi
combination. Appellants argue that the admitted prior art
usage of position and height data does not suggest the
efficient and accurate positional control achieved by the
claimed invention [request, pages 8-9].

Takeuchi discloses that “even if the machining
condition differs for every workpiece every pallet, the pallet
itself has the machining data corresponding to the machining
condition” [column 9, lines 39-42]. This passage suggests
that whatever data is needed to properly machine a given
workpiece is stored in a workpiece data storage means (the
pallet). The artisan would have appreciated that no workpiece
can be properly machined unless the relative positional
dimensions and locations of the tool and the workpiece are
stored as part of the machining program. Therefore, we still
agree with the examiner's conclusion that it would have been
obvious to store position and height data of each workpiece in
a workpiece data storage means.

Appellants argue that the means plus function language
of claims 1-6, 19 and 21 has not been properly interpreted.

This argument was first made at the oral hearing, and the

6




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

earlier Board decision noted that this argument was not timely
made since the issue had not been addressed in the brief.
Appellants note that 37 CFR § 1.193(b)(1) was amended to
permit an appellant to file a reply brief without restriction
to new points of argument. The relevance of this argument is
not understood because appellants filed no reply brief in this
application. The critical question as we view it is the
timeliness of the arguments with respect to the interpretation
of the means plus function language.

Appellants are correct to assert that the examiner has
the responsibility to interpret means plus function language
in the manner required by the sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. §
112. Whether or not the examiner successfully complied with
this responsibility, however, is a legal and factual question
which must be argued. When a rejection on appeal is decided
by the Board, arguments not made by appellant in the brief are
not considered and are effectively waived. Appellants’
failure to address the question of claim interpretation in the
brief has deprived us of an opportunity to consider the
examiner's position with respect to this question. Thus, we

agree with the earlier Board decision that appellants’

7




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 1997-4315
Application No. 08/159,618

arguments related to claim interpretation were not timely made
at oral hearing and, therefore, are not timely made as part
of this request for rehearing.

We note appellants’ request that we remand this
application to the examiner for a consideration of the claim
interpretation question. For reasons discussed above, we
decline to remand this application to consider an issue which
was not timely raised. Appellants are free to argue this
issue, however, in continued prosecution of this invention
before the examiner. In summary, we have carefully
considered the arguments raised by appellants in their request
for rehearing, but we can find no errors in the original Board
decision. We are of the view that the invention set forth in
claims 1-6, 19 and 21 would have been obvious within the
meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 103 in view of the applied prior art.

We have granted appellants’ request to the extent that
we have reconsidered the decision of June 23, 2000, but we
deny the request with respect to making any changes therein.

No period for taking any subsequent action in connection
with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).
