UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte BRETT P. SEBER et al.

Appeal No. 1998-3423
Application No. 08/584,962

ON BRIEF

Before ABRAMS, STAAB, and MCQUADE, Administrative Patent Judges.
ABRAMS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This case comes before us again on request for rehearing of our decision of
September 5, 2000, wherein we affirmed the decision of the examiner. The appellants
requested that we reconsider certain aspects of the reasoning which led to our conclusion
to affirm the examer's positions. We have done so and, for the reasons expressed below,

we have altered our decision. The Request for Rehearing is GRANTED.

OPINION

The appellants’ invention relates to a folding combination tool. The following were
the rejections before us on appeal, all of them under 35 U.S.C. § 103:

(1) Claims 1-6, 12, 13 and 15-18 on the basis of Frazer in view of Newton.
(2) Claim 14 on the basis of Frazer in view of Newton and Pullman.

(3) Claims 1, 4-6, 12, 13 and 15-18 on the basis of Frazer in view of Schmidt.
(4) Claim 14 on the basis of Frazer in view of Schmidt and Pullman.

In our decision, we sustained all of the examiner's rejections, thereby affirming the
examiner's decision. A key tactor in each of the rejections was modification of the Frazer
combination tool by causing the handles to move in opposite directions between the
nested position and the deployed position, rather than in the same direction, as disclosed,
based upon the teachings of Newton or Schmidt. The appellants argue in the Request for
Rehearing (Request) that the Board erred in five respects, the second of which tocuses on
the propriety of this modification. The appellants pointed to passages in column 3 of
Frazer as support for their position that Frazer’s invention does not work unless the
handles fold in the same direction (Request, pages 6 and 7). While this point was raised
on page 6 ot the Appellants’ Brief, we have revisited this issue in the light of all of the
arguments presented in the Request, and now find ourselves in agreement with the
appellants’ position. Our reasoning follows.

Frazer discloses a combination hand tool with a pair of pliers jaws operated by

handles. A plurality of additional implements are pivotally stowed within each of the




*** PAGE 3 ***

handles. As illustrated in the drawings, the handles and the jaws are connected together
by pivots such that they are movable in the same direction with respect to one another
between a nested position and a deployed position (Figures 4-6). The pivot axes are
oriented at angles to each other, so that during the final phase ot rotation of the jaws into
the nested position (Figures 5 and 6), the handles are drawn together, causing them to
become interlocked by virtue of the interaction ot projections 19 on one handle with
notches 20 on the other. Owing to this arrangement of elements, an advantage is provided
when an additional implement, such as a knife blade, is deployed tor use from inside a
handle. As explained in column 3, in order to free an implement stowed in a handle for
use, the jaws are rotated to the deployed position (Figure 4), whereupon the handles
become spreadable and the implement can be moved to its operating position. The jaws
then are rotated to the nested position (Figure 7), at which point they become interlocked.
As explained in line 47 et seg.,

such interlocking allows a convenient working position for a pocket knife

implement. When the jaw members are projected from the handles, a

selected implement can be swung to its open position, whereupon the jaw

members can be swung to their nested or retracted position so as to

interlock the handles together. As shown in FIG. 7, the projected implement

9 will be in a projected working position with the interlocked side-by-side

handles forming a convenient grip allowing manipulation of the implement

without the danger of the implement closing on the hand of the user.

If the Frazer device were modified in the manner proposed by the examiner, that is, so that

the handles moved with respect to the jaws in opposite directions, it would appear that this

feature of the invention would be destroyed. Even acknowledging that it was known in the
art at the time of the appellants’ invention to fold the handles of this type of tool in opposite
directions to obtain other advantages, as explicitly is taught by Schmidt, the fact that the
proposed modification would nullify a basic feature of the Frazer invention would have
operated as a disincentive for one of ordinary skill in the art to do so.

Independent claims 1 and 16 each contain the requirement that the handles of the
device be rotatable in opposite directions between nested positions wherein they are
coplanar with the two jaws and adjacent thereto and deployed positions wherein they are
coplanar with the two jaws and remote therefrom. On the basis of the reasoning set forth
above, it is our view that the required suggestion to combine the references in such a
manner as to render the claimed subject matter obvious is lacking. This being the case, it
is our opinion that the combined teachings of Frazer and Newton, and Frazer and Schmidt,
fail to establish a grima facie case of obviousness with regard to the subject matter recited
in independent claims 1 and 16. We therefore will not sustain any of the rejections,
considering that Pullman, which was additionally cited against claim 14, fails to overcome
the deficiency in the other references.

QQNQLUSION

Our decision of September 5, 2000, hereby is modified in the following manner:

(1) None of the rejections are sustained.

(2) The decision of the examiner is reversed.
