ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, FLEMING and LALL, Administrative Patent Judges.

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
In a paper filed on April 26, 2001, bearing a Certificate of Mailing date of April 23,
2001, appellants request that we rehear our decision of February 23, 2001, in which we

affirmed and reversed the rejection of some claims under 35 U.S.C. § 102 and affirmed




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

and reversed some claims rejected under 35 U.S.C. §103. The request is thus filed in a
timely manner. In the request appellants set forth what amounts to three points alleging
misapprehension by us in our earlier opinion of certain features of the prior art as applied
only to independent claims 1, 15 and 24 on appeal, which are in the context only of the
rejection within 35 U.S.C. § 102.

As to the first point, appellants allege that we improperly interpreted what
constitutes a "chip site" in independent claims 1, 15 and 24. We do not see that
appellants have alleged any error at pages 2-4 of the request. We discussed chip sites in
various contexts at pages 6-9 of our original opinion even to the point of making reference
to appellants’ disclosure in the paragraph bridging pages 8 and 9 of our original opinion
as the term was originally used in the specification as filed.

Appellants’ reference to plural integrated circuit chips as discussed at page 3 of the
request is noted. Besides stating that Sommerfeldt is consistent with appellants’
consideration of what a chip site is, appellants make reference to their own specification
generally relating to a discussion of Multi-Chip Modules or MCMs. The discussion at

columns 1 and 2 of Sommerfeldt is consistent with this description of what an MCM is.

Thus, Sommerfeldt clearly suggests there, if not its entire discussion and the portions we
outlined at pages 6-9 of our original opinion, that plural integrated circuit chips or plural
chips may be embodied on the top surface of the Figure 1 device 10 in Sommerleldt.

At the bottom of page 6 of our original decision, we stated that the "entire depiction
in Figure 2 [of Sommerfeldt] may comprise a so-called ‘chip site.’ We therefore agree with
the examiner's view expressed at the seventh page of the answer.“ There, the examiner
states that "any group of these pads can be called a chip site." It is appellants and not us
or the examiner at page 2 of the request that indicates that only two bonding pads may
constitute a chip site. Appellants‘ discussion in the remaining portion of the tirst alleged
error seems to be focused only upon a consideration of two bonding pads as a chip site.
The examiner seemed to be indicating that Sommerfe|dt’s chip sites may be located
anywhere. It appears that appellants have attempted to set up a redherring argument only
to shoot it down. We also indicated at the bottom of page 8 of our original opinion that
appellants‘ discussion of chip sites in the paragraph
bridging specification pages 7 and 8 should not be considered to be sites for receiving
complete integrated circuits or chips themselves since they are merely described there to

receive discrete semiconductor devices.

Appellants next assert at pages 4-6 of the request that we misapprehended
"whether Sommerfeldt accomplishes their wiring objectives on a single sublayer as
required by Appellants’ claims 1, 15 and 24." Appellants state at the top of page 5 that
"there is no teaching g disclosure in Sommerfeldt that one of the upper or lower planes
may be used to the exclusion of the other." Appellants invite us at the top of page 6 "to
particularly point out where in Sommerfeldt it is stated or disclosed that one of the upper Q
lower wiring planes may be used alone to connect wiring cells or route the conductive lines
across the interconnect device."

At the outset, we noted at page 6 of our original opinion that the respective planes
or layers 68 and 70 of representative Figure 8 and their corresponding layers in Figures 2,
3, and 6 may separately comprise an individual or single sublayer to the extent recited at
the end of each independent claim 1, 15 and 24 on appeal. We remain of this view. The

"comprising" nature of each independent claim 1, 15 and 24

on appeal does not exclude the fact that Sommerfeldt may require additional layers
beyond the planes or layers 68 and 70 of representative Figure 8. Sommerte|dt’s Figure 8

layers compare with appellants’ layers in Figure 1 as disclosed. Moreover, Sommerfeldt




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

states at lines 3-6 of the abstract that the "interconnect device is fully customizable or
programmable upon the upper surface to accommodate various electrical components
and connectivity to those components." A similar statement is made in Sommerfe|dt’s
Summary of the Invention at the bottom of column 2 at lines

64 and 65 which is that "the improved MCM hereof is not only fully programmable on only
the surface layer." We identified certain layers in Sommerfeldt as comprising the claimed
"single sublayer" in the last lines of each independent claim on appeal. These claims
require nothing more.

Finally, we turn our attention to the third point at pages 6 and 7 of the request.
There, appellants alleged that we misapprehended whether Sommerfeldt discloses the
inter pad limitation of independent claims 1, 15 and 24. The context in which we
discussed the inter pad spacing at the top of page 10 is the whole paragraph bridging
pages 9 and 10. The basic premise is that the bonding pads may be connected in any
manner in association with the use of connective links 58 shown in Figures 6 and 7. All of
this is caught up in the context of what we considered to be a chip site as discussed in this
paragraph. All that the claim requires is that a pair of connection pads at one chip site be

separated from the chip connection pads at another site by a space greater than any of the




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1998-3071
Application 08/477,054

inter pad spaces. Because Sommerfeldt indicates that his integrated circuit chips may be
mounted in various locations or "chip sites," the spacing between them implicitly is greater
than any space between the pads themselves at least to provide enough space between
the chip sites or the integrated circuit chips themselves.

Since we are unpersuaded that we misapprehended or overlooked appellants’
three enumerated points as set forth in the request for rehearing, we do not change our
views expressed in our February 23, 2001 opinion that the subject matter of independent
claims 1, 15 and 24 was anticipated by Sommerfeldt within 35 U.S.C.

§ 102.

be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).
