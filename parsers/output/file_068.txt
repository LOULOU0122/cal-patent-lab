Paper No. 19

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte TIMOTHY J. CHAINER, DEAN A. HERMAN, JR.,
SOL KRONGELB, LUBOMYR T. ROMANKIW and EDWARD J. YARMCHUK

Appeal No. 1997-3472
Application 08/405,278

ON BRIEF

Before KRASS, FLEMING and HECKER, Administrative Patent
Judges.

FLEMING, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request that we reconsider our decision dated
May 31, 2000, with respect to affirming the Examiner's
decision rejecting claims 14-18 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second

paragraph.

Appellants argue on page 3 that claim l, from which claim
l4 depends, recites that the rotor is integrated with a disk
in a one piece assembly. Appellants argue that claim 1 is
broadly written and does not recite that the rotor must be
directly attached coplanar to only the perimeter of the disk
as shown in the Figure l embodiment. Appellants argue that
claim l4 is another species in which the rotor l6d is now
being defined with its cooperating rotor shaft 34d as joined
to the plural disk. Appellants argue that the structure as
recited in claim l4 is integrated with a disk in a one—piece
assembly as claimed in Appellants‘ claim l. On page 4 of the
request for rehearing, Appellants further point to Appellants‘
specification arguing that it clearly discloses the one—piece
ABS construction of a rotor shaft 34d and disk 12, and the
rotor l6 formed on the shaft. Appellants argue that the
specification expressly discloses at page 12, line l+, that
not only can magnetic coatings be applied to the surface of
the ABS disk l2, but the entire rotor l6d may be formed from a

suitable magnetic material. Appellants argue that this is

ample support in the specification for a one—piece assembly of
the disk 12, rotor shaft 34d and rotor l6d recited in claim 14
and expressly illustrated in Figure 8.

In our May 31, 2000 decision, we interpreted Appellants’
claim l4 language, "a plurality of storage disks coaxially
joined to a rotor shaft and axially spaced from each other for
allowing independent access thereto, and said rotor is
coaxially joined to said rotor shaft and axially spaced from
said disk for simultaneously rotating of said disk", as
reciting separate pieces being attached together. We found
that the structure recited in Appellants‘ claim 14 was not "a
rotor integrated with said disk in a one piece assembly" as
recited in claim 1 because claim 14 was reciting structure
that included independent pieces being attached together which
is not a one—piece integrated assembly. Having benefit of
Appellants‘ arguments as set forth in the request for
rehearing, we find that claim 14 language is simply labeling
the parts of a one—piece assembly in which the rotor is
integrated with the disk. We agree with the Appellants that
in viewing the claim language in this light, the claim 1

recital of "a rotor integrated with a disk in a one—piece

assembly" is broad enough in scope to include the structure as
recited in claim 14 in which the assembly is a rotor
integrated with a disk in a one piece assembly in which there
is a plurality of disks coaxially joined to a rotor shaft and

axially spaced from said disk.

In view of this interpretation of claim 14, we thereby
find that we can determine the scope of claim 14.
Accordingly, we reverse the rejection of claims 14-18 under 35
U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph. Furthermore, we reverse the
rejection of claims 14-18 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 for the same
reasons that we set forth in our opinion dated May 31, 2000.

In regard to whether the specification supports the
interpretation of claim 14 in which there is a disclosure of
an integrated one—piece assembly having a plurality of storage
disks coaxially joined to a rotor shaft and axially spaced
apart from each other for allowing independent access thereto
and said rotor is coaxially joined to said rotor shaft and
axially spaced from the disk for simultaneously rotating of
said disk, we note that this issue is not before us for our

decision. We will leave this to the Examiner to determine if

there is a description as required by 35 U.S.C. § 112, first
paragraph, within the specification to support such an

interpretation of claim l4.

Appellants request for rehearing is granted.
