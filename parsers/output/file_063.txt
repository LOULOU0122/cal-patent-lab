UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Appeal No. 2004-1408
Application No. 10/166,590

ON BRIEF

Before PAK, OWENS, and DELMENDO, Administrative Patent Judges.

DELMENDO, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REHEARING
This is in response to the appellant's request for

rehearing (request) pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.197(b)
(2003)(effective Dec. 1, 1997), filed on Jul. 15, 2004 (paper
15), of our Jun. 28, 2004 decision (paper 14). In our original
decision, we affirmed the examiner's rejection under 35 U.S.C. §
103(a) (2003) of appealed claims 27 and 30 as unpatentable over
U.S. Patent No. 4,150,851 issued to Cienfuegos on Apr. 24, 1979.

Application No. 10/166,590

Because we do not find any of the appellant's arguments to
be persuasive, we decline to modify our original decision in any
respect.

The appellant argues that Cienfuegos does not provide any
motivation to form the claimed adjustable support and in fact
teaches away from it. (Request at 2.) Specifically, the
appellant alleges (;g.):

The structural requirements logically imposed by
the reference to form a device adjustable to hold a
seat at a plurality of closely spaced apart elevations
to accommodate a plurality of users having different
sizes is in direct conflict with the required large
distance (“greater than about 2 inches”) between first
and second adjacent holdable positions. The reference
teaches away from the claimed widely spaced apart
holdable positions by suggesting a mechanism operable
to hold a seat at a plurality of closely spaced apart
positions to fit all of a plurality of users having a
variety of sizes. In conflict with MPEP 2143.01, the
asserted modification renders the prior art
unsatisfactory for its intended purpose.

We do not agree. While Cienfuegos teaches that an
“exercycle in a gymnasium is used by large numbers of different
people during the course of the day” (column 3, lines 1-3),
nothing in the reference indicates that the disclosed adjustable
support must necessarily accommodate “all of a plurality of
users having a variety of sizes." That is, nothing in

Cienfuegos indicates to one of ordinary skill in the art that a

support that is incrementally adjustable in height by greater
than about 2 inches would be unusable. In re Gurley, 27 F.3d
551, 553, 31 UsPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

To the contrary, Cienfuegos would have suggested to one of
ordinary skill in the art that a support having several
adjustable height positions at, e.g., about 2-inch increments
would be suitable for use as part of a home exercycle or
bicycle. Although the same adjustable support might not
comfortably accommodate the entire world population, it would
nevertheless be useful for a significant portion of the general
population. In the case of a child's bicycle, such increments
would facilitate periodic height adjustments commensurate with
the natural growth of the child. Here, one of ordinary skill in
the art would have recognized from the teachings of the prior
art that the number of possible height positions and the
distance be:ween the positions of adjacent heights would
necessarily affect the cost of manufacturing the device. For a
given overall length of adjustable support, the total number of
drilled holes increases as the distance between the adjacent

height posi:ions is decreased. Thus, one of ordinary skill in

the art would have balanced the desirability of accommodating

the entire population against the cost of manufacturing the
device.

The appellant urges that if the first and second holdable
positions were spaced at greater than 2 inches in the support of
Cienfuegos, a person with an intermediate height “unavoidably
would be precluded from supporting the seat at his desired
ergonomic elevation..." (Request at 3.) We are not persuaded,
because the appellant has failed to identify any objective
evidence in the record establishing that a person of such
intermediate height would be inconvenienced to any significant
degree, much less unable to use the exercycle or bicycle.

The appellant alleges that the recited distance between the
first and second holdable positions “is outside a known, or even
reasonably suggested, range." (Request at 3.) Again, however,
the appellant has utterly failed to establish that the recited
distance would result in a support that is unusable for any of
the purposes disclosed or suggested in Cienfuegos.

The appellant contends that “more precise adjustment
obtained from a smaller spacing was admitted by the Examiner at
page 2 of paper No. 5, which constitutes evidence in the record
to substantiate criticality for a size of a spacing between

holdable positions." (Request at 4.) This position lacks

Appeal No. 2004-1408

Application No. 10/166,590

merit. In the final Office action mailed May 1, 2003 (paper 5),
the examiner merely repeated a finding of fact made in the
Office action mailed Feb. 4, 2003 (paper 3). This finding of
fact, which the appellant does not dispute, does not constitute
evidence substantiating “criticality,” much less unexpected
criticality. Rather, it constitutes evidence of ohviousness.

The appellant's request is granted to the extent of

reconsidering our original decision but is denied with respect

to making any substantive changes thereto.
