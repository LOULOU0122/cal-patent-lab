ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to the appellant's request for rehearing‘ of our decision mailed

July 31, 2002, wherein we affirmed the examiner's rejection of claim 3 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 103 as being unpatentable over the acknowledged prior art set forth on pages 1, 2 and 6

of the specification (hereafter, APA) in view of Wierz.

 

‘ Filed August 12, 2002.

2 Wier, Adventure Travel Photography, 26 (New York, Watson-Guptill Publications, 1992).

Appeal No. 2002-1809 Page 2
Application No. 09/798,050

The argument (p. 2) raised by the appellant is that this panel of the Board of Patent
Appeals and interferences overlooked the fact that
the Wier prior art was withdrawn and deemed in the EXAMlNER'S ANSWER at

page 5 in the last paragraph as "art rejections of non-final Office Action of June 26,
2001 [that] are no longer applied to the appealed claim."

We have carefully considered the argument raised by the appellant in the request
for rehearing, however, the argument therein does not persuade us that our decision was
in error in any respect. In fact, the argument does not set forth any error in our
detennination that claim 3 was unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over the combined

teachings of APA and Wier.

We do not agree with the appellant's apparent argument that Wier was withdrawn
as prior art being applied against claim 3 for the following reasons: (1) Weir was cited and
applied against claim 3 in the final rejection (Paper No. 5, mailed October 9, 2001);

(2) Weir was cited and applied against claim 3 in the examiner's answer (Paper No. 8,
mailed March 21, 2002); and (3) on page 2 of the answer, the examiner stated that "[t]he
appellant's statement of the issues in the brief is correct" and the sole issue set forth on
page 3 of the appellant's brief (Paper No. 6, filed January 18, 2002) was whether claim 3
on appeal is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over the APA in view of Wier. While the

examiner did state on page 5 of the answer that "[i]n response to arguments of lines 17

and 18 of page 6, the art rejections of non-final Office Action of June 26, 2001 are no
longer applied to the appealed claim," we cannot speculate as to what the examiner
meant. However, it is clear to us that the examiner did not mean by that statement to
withdraw Wier as a reference being applied in the final rejection of claim 3 that was being

appealed.

In light of the foregoing, the appellant's request for rehearing is granted to the
extent of reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to making any change

thereto.
