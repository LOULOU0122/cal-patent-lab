Paper No. 21
UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte REMY RUPPEL, PIERRE LAURENT and JOEL HUNGLER

Appeal No. 1996-3589
Application No. 08/098,325

ON BRIEF

Before GARRIS, PAK and OWENS, Administrative Patent Judges.

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request that we reconsider our decision mailed
on February 3, 2000 wherein we affirmed the rejection of
claims 8-14 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over Schulz, Donnelly,
Thomas or Wells, each taken alone or in view of Nystrand.

Appellants argue that 1) not all of the claimed features
are taught in the prior art and, therefore, optimization
cannot provide for obviousness of each of the claimed
features, 2) Schulz teaches only a tip—to—tip assembly having

a single pattern of deep and shallow bosses, and does not

provide a teaching regarding the height of the bosses or
recognize a criticality as to boss density, distribution or
dual patterns, and 3) Nystrand uses a different density
combination than that claimed and does not recognize a height
for two separate embossing patterns as being different.

Appellants, however, do not address the discussion in our
opinion regarding how Schulz and Nystrand apply to appellants’
claims, and present a specific argument as to why appellants
consider our analysis to be incorrect. Consequently, we are
not convinced of error in our decision.

We have reconsidered our decision but, for the reason
given above, decline to make any change thereto.
