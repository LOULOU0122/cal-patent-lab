Ex Qarte HENDRIK M. HAAN

Appeal No. 2004-2036
Application No. 09/885,264

ON BRIEF

Betore FRANKFORT, STAAB and BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.
BAHR, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on appe||ant’s request for rehearing (Paper No. 35) of our
decision mailed September 29, 2004 (Paper No. 34) sustaining the examiner's rejection
of claim 1 as being unpatentable over Rius and entering a new rejection of claims 2 and
3 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph. In other words, this is a decision both on
appellant's request for rehearing under 37 CFR § 41 .52(a)(1) with regard to the affirmed
rejection ot claim 1 and on appellant's request for rehearing under 37 CFR § 41 .50(b)(2)

with regard to the new ground of rejection of claims 2 and 3.

Appeal No. 2004-2036 2

Application No. 09/885,264

We turn first to appe||ant’s request for rehearing of our decision sustaining the
rejection of claim 1 as being unpatentable over Rius. The basis of appellant's request
for rehearing appears to be that this panel overlooked or misapprehended the argument
on page 10 of appellant's brief, which alluded to distinctions between Rius and
appellant's invention, the “Water-Wipe" (W-W) system, pointed out by appellant in an
earlier communication, a copy of which was appended as page 33 of appellant's brief.
This, however, is not the case. As pointed out on pages 3-4 of our decision, these
alleged distinctions are not directed to limitations recited in appe||ant’s claim 1 and thus
are not relevant to the issue of the patentability of claim 1 over Rius.

With particular regard to appellant's reference to the “novelty of W-W's design”
and the "[s]imp|ified new and useful structure," of appellant's invention, it is the subject
matter of appellant's claims which is relevant in determinations of anticipation and
obviousness. As stated by our reviewing court in In re Hiniker Co., 150 F.3d 1362,
1369, 47 USPQ2d 1523, 1529 (Fed. Cir. 1998), “the name of the game is the claim."
Thus, while there may in fact be unobvious differences between the invention disclosed
by appellant and the disclosure of Rius, those differences have not been set forth in
claim 1. It is well established that only those features recited in appellant's claims can
be relied upon for patentability. E In re Self, 671 F.2d 1344, 1348, 213 USPQ 1, 5

(CCPA 1982).

Appeal No. 2004-2036 3

Application No. 09/885,264

For the foregoing reasons, appellant's request for rehearing does not persuade
us of any error in our decision to sustain the rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. § 103
as being unpatentable over Rius.

We turn next to appellant's request for rehearing of our decision entering a new
ground of rejection of claims 2 and 3 under the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112.
Appellant's explanation of the process of designing appellant's invention does nothing to
remedy the fact that appellant's claims 2 and 3 are drafted in language which renders
the scope of these claims unclear, for the reasons discussed on pages 5 and 6 of our
decision. It follows that appellant's request for rehearing fails to persuade us of any
error in our decision to enter a new ground of rejection of claims 2 and 3 under the
second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112.

CONCLUSION

Appellants’ request for rehearing has been granted to the extent of our
reconsidering our earlier decision but has been denied to the extent of our making any
modification to that earlier decision. The rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
being unpatentable over Rius remains affirmed and claims 2 and 3 remain rejected
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph. This decision on appe||ant’s overall appeal

is now final for purposes of judicial review.
