Paper No. 18

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte SHEDRICK D. JONES

Appeal No. 1999-0117
Application O8/702,948

ON BRIEF

Before ABRAMS, STAAB and NASE, Administrative Patent Judges.

STAAB, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Appellant requests rehearing of our decision of September
22, 1999, wherein we (1) affirmed the examiner's final rejection
of claims 6-15 as being based on an original disclosure that
fails to comply with the written description requirement found in

the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112, and (2) dismissed the

Application 08/702,948

appeal as to finally rejected claims 20 and 22.1 Appellant
requests rehearing only with respect to (1).

As explained on pages 3-4 of our decision, two limitations
added to the claims during prosecution are considered by the
examiner as lacking descriptive support in the application as
originally filed. The first questioned limitation pertains to
the distal end configuration of the implant, while the second
limitation sets forth that the at least one helical channel of
the implant has “closed ends.” Appellant contends that we did
not analyze the original disclosure’s compliance with the written
description requirement according to the test set forth by the
Federal Circuit, but instead created and used our own test.
Specifically, appellant contends that we, in effect, required
that literal support be found in the original disclosure for the
limitations in question.

We have carefully reviewed our decision affirming the
examiner's rejection in light of appellant's request for
rehearing, but find no point that we have misapprehended or

overlooked in arriving at our decision. Accordingly, we decline

1 The appeal as to claims 20 and 22 was dismissed in light
of appellant's statement on page 1 of the brief that the appeal
of these claims was no longer being pursued. These claims should
be canceled. MPEP § 1214.05.

to make any change thereto. Although we believe our original
decision adequately treats all the points raised by appellant in
the request for rehearing, we add the following comments for
emphasis.

Throughout the request, appellant criticizes our decision
for its alleged failure to take into account “the role of the
artisan in determining compliance [with the descriptive support
requirement of the first paragraph of § 112]” (request, page 3).
According to appellant, the disclosure in the present application
of tapered ends in the drawings, coupled with appellant's
disclosure of the purpose of the distal ends as being to allow
easy entry into the hole in the bone tissue, and the “presumed
knowledge of a person skilled in the art of patents describing
implants with flat distal ends that allow easy entry into holes”
(request, page 5), would have conveyed to the artisan that

“reasonable variations” of the embodiments of Figs. 6

and 7 [e.g., claimed distal end configurations #3 and

#4] are also embodiments of appellant's invention and

were in the possession of the appellant at the time of

filing of the application, even though there is an

“absence of literal support in the specification for

the claim language.” [Request, page 6.]

Our difficulty with this argument is that it requires

considerable speculation on our part of matters such as the

presumed knowledge of the ordinarily skilled artisan, how the

-3-

Application O8/702,948

artisan would use such knowledge to interpret appellant's
disclosure, and what the ordinarily skilled artisan would
consider a “reasonable variations” of the embodiments illustrated
in the Figures 6 and 7 embodiments. For example, appellant lists
on page 3 of the request several U.S. Patents, presumably for the
proposition that they demonstrate “the skilled—in—the—art
person's knowledge of patented implants having flat distal ends
that permitted easy entry of the implants into holes."2 It is
not apparent to us that one of ordinary skill in the art would
have understood these patents as teaching that flat distal ends
permit easy entry of implants into holes. In any event, even
assuming that these patents establish this concept as being
generally within the skill in the art, appellant has not
persuasively argued why the artisan would have presumed said
concept to be part of appellant's invention in the present
application. This is especially so in that appellant appears to
teach the opposite, namely, that the distal end of the implant
should be tapered. From our perspective, appellant appears to

ask us to presume as an article of faith that one of ordinary

 

2 To the extent these patents are cited for this purpose,
this is a new point of argument made for the first time in this

request, and is therefore untimely.

skill in the art would understand the presently claimed distal
end configurations #3 and #4 as being “reasonable variations” of
the Figures 6 and 7 embodiments, notwithstanding that they are
not disclosed in the original disclosure. In the absence of some
more convincing line of reasoning or evidence in support of this
position, we decline to do so.

On page 8 of the request, appellant maintains that “[t]he
Board apparently did not recognize appellant's the [sic] claim—6
limitation that is at issue in this appeal as being a means—plus—
function limitation.” The parts of claims 6 and 15 that describe
the shape of the distal end of the implant do not invoke the
sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112 because they do not use the
word “means” in association with any function of the distal end.
Accordingly, appellant's view that the parts of claims 6 and 15
that describe the shape of the distal end of the implant can
somehow be interpreted as being means—plus—function limitations
is not well taken.

Concerning the helical channel “closed end” limitation added
to claim 6 during prosecution, we stand by our determination that
this limitation is not inherently disclosed in the original
disclosure of the present application. Where, as here, the

channel could be configured to have ends that are either both

Appeal No. 1999-0117
Application 08/702,948

open, or both closed, or one open and one closed, it is not
apparent to us how one of these possible channel configuration
choices, namely, both closed, is an inherent characteristic of
the helical channel. Nor is it apparent to us that the mere
disclosure of a helical channel, in and of itself, would be
construed by a person skilled in the art as a disclosure of a
channel having both ends closed.

Appellant's request for rehearing is granted to the extent
of reconsidering our decision, but is denied as to making any
change thereto.
