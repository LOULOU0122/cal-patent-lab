Paper No. 18

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte JOHN R. J. SORENSON

Appeal No. 1997-3047
Application O8/480,152

ON BRIEF

Before GARRIS, WARREN and OWENS, Administrative Patent Judges.

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests reconsideration of our decision mailed
on December 22, 2000, wherein we affirmed the rejections of
claims 1-8 under the judicially created doctrine of
obviousness—type double patenting over claims 1-9 of Sorenson

‘834 and over claims l—8 of Sorenson ‘l7l. We treat this

request as a request for rehearing under 37 CFR

§ l.l97(b)(l997).

Appellant argues that the examiner's January 15, l976
restriction requirement established that the generic claim was
separately patentable from the species claims (request,
pages 2-3). What the examiner stated in the restriction
requirement (pages 2-3) is that “[s]ince the various compounds
embraced by the claims are not so related that a prior art
reference anticipating the claims in respected [sic] to
certain members would render the claims obvious in respect to
other members, applicant is further, required to elect a
single disclosed species and to list all claims readable
thereon including claims subsequently added.” This statement
clearly pertains to separate patentability among the species,
and not to separate patentability of the genus and any of the
species therein, because a reference which anticipates a
specie also anticipates a genus which encompasses that specie.

See In re Gosteli, 872 F.2d lOO8, lOlO, lO USPQ2d l6l4, l6l6

(Fed. Cir. l989).

Appeal No. 1997-3047
Application O8/480,152

Appellant argues that consonance is not an absolute
requirement for 35 U.S.C. § 121 to apply (request, page 3).

Appellant relies upon Applied Materials Inc. v. Advanced
Semiconductor Materials, 98 F.3d 1563, 1568, 40 USPQ2d 1481,

1484 (Fed. Cir. 1996), wherein the majority stated that “even
if such consonance [i.e., demarcation among the separate
inventions] is lost, double patenting does not follow if the
requirements of § 121 are met or if the claims are in fact
patentably distinct."1 Section 121 requires that inventions
which are restricted from each other must be independent and
distinct from each other. As explained in our decision (pages
5-6), the generic claims in the present case are not
independent and distinct from the claims in Sorenson ‘834 or
Sorenson ‘171. Appellant, therefore, is not entitled to the
benefit of 35 U.S.C. § 121.

Appellant argues that Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs. Inc.,

1 In a dissent—in—part, Judge Archer, citing Gerber
Garment Technology, Inc. V. Lectra Sys., 916 F.2d 683, 688, 16
USPQ2d 1436, 1440 (Fed. Cir. 1990), stated that “[t]his court
has ruled, however, that the protection of § 121 is only
available for claims issued on a divisional application that
are consonant with the examiner's restriction requirement."
Applied Materials, 98 F.3d at 1577, 40 USPQ2d at 1492.

222 F.3d 973, 987, 55 USPQ2d 1609, 1619 (Fed. Cir. 2000),
relied upon by the board (decision, pages 8-9), is contrary to
prior controlling law (request, pages 3-4). Appellant argues

that In re Stanley, 214 F.2d 151, 102 USPQ 234 (CCPA 1954)

indicates that mere dominance by generic claims is not

decisive (request, page 4). In Stanley, the Truitt patent had

the same assignee as the appellant's application, was based
upon an application filed more than two years after the
appellant's application was filed, and contained claims which
were limited to an improvement over the appellant's generic

claims. Stanley, 214 F.2d at 152 and 158, 102 USPQ at 235 and
240. The court in Stanley, 214 F.2d at 156, 102 USPQ at 238,
citing In re Mann, 47 F.2d 370, 8 USPQ 381 (CCPA 1931), noted

what it called an exception to the obviousness—type double
patenting rejection:

In certain cases, where there are two
applications by different inventors, but held by a
common assignee, and there is a disclosure of the
same basic invention in both applications, but in
one of which it is asserted that the applicant is
the inventor only of an improvement in the basic
invention disclosed, a patent issued upon the
improvement claim [sic] in such last named
application is not a bar to a patent upon the other
application....

Appeal No. l997—3047
Application O8/480,152

The court in Stanley stated:

We are of the opinion that the generic invention is
not rendered unpatentable by the fact that a prior
patent has been issued on a distinct improvement of
that invention. We think this appeal clearly comes
within the exception set out in the Mann and
Koppleman case, supra, since none of the appealed
claims could have been made on the Truitt
disclosure, nor do both applications disclose the
same invention. Further, we think that the

appellants should not be denied a patent for their
invention because of the specific improvement patent
to Truitt merely on the basis of the common
assignee.

Stanley, 214 F.2d at l59, lO2 USPQ at 240.

The court in Stanley discussed Thomson—Houston Electric
Co. v. Ohio Brass Co., 80 F. 7l2 (6th Cir. l897), which is
relied upon by appellant (request, pages 3-4). The Stanley
court stated that in Thomson—Houston, the court held that the
‘45l patent, which was drawn to distinct and specific
structural improvements in the device claimed in the ‘695
patent which was based on an application filed more than a
year before the filing of the application which led to the
first—to—issue ‘45l patent, did not render the ‘695 patent

invalid. See Stanley, 214 F.2d at l54—55, lO2 USPQ at 237.

Thus, the facts in Thomson—Houston were comparable to those in




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. l997-3047
Application O8/480,152

Stanley, and the decisions in these cases were consistent with
each other.

The facts in Lilly, however, were quite different from
the facts in Stanley and Thomson—Houston. In Lilly, claim l

of the ‘895 patent recited treating depression in humans by
administering a compound within a genus which included
fluoxetine hydrochloride, and claim 7 of the ‘549 patent
recited administering fluoxetine hydrochloride to an animal to
block serotonin uptake in the animal's brain neurons. See
Lilly, 222 F.3d at 978-79, 55 USPQ2d at l6l2—l3. The
applications which led to the ‘895 and ‘549 patents were
filed, respectively, on September 17, l975 and March 31, l986,
and issued, respectively, on April 19, l977 and December 2,
l986. According to the court, both claimed benefit under 35
U.S.C. § l2O of the filing date of an application filed in
1974. See Lilly, 222 F.3d at 978-79, 55 USPQ2d at l6l2—l3.
The court stated that “[t]hroughout the term of the ‘895
patent, by virtue of claim l’s broad coverage, Lilly possessed
the right to exclude other parties from administering any of

the thousands of claimed compounds, including but not limited




*** PAGE 7 ***

Application O8/480,152

to fluoxetine hydrochloride, to treat depression.” See Lilly,

222 F.3d at 986-87, 55 USPQ2d at 1618. According to the

court:
The only discernible difference between claim 1 of
the ‘895 patent and claim 7 of the ‘549 patent is
that the former addresses the treatment of
depression in humans while the latter addresses the
treatment of serotonin uptake in animals. Humans
are a species of the animal genus, and depression is
a species ailment of the genus of ailments caused by
defective serotonin uptake. Our case law firmly
establishes that a later genus claim is not
patentable over an earlier species claim.

Lilly, 222 F.3d 987, 55 USPQ2d 1619.

Thus, contrary to appellant's argument, Lilly is not
inconsistent with Stanley and Thomson—Houston. Stanley and
Thomson—Houston involved the situation in which a later filed

application claiming a specie within a genus issues before an
earlier filed application which claims the genus. In both of
those cases, the courts held that the specie claims could not
be used to reject claims to the genus in an obviousness—type
double patenting rejection. The court in Stanley indicated
that prior courts applied a two—way test for obviousness—type

double patenting in such a situation. See Stanley, 214 F.2d

at 155, 102 F.2d 238. Appellant in the present case has not

7




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 1997-3047
Application O8/480,152

argued that a two—way test should be used. Lilly, on the
other hand, involved the situation in which two patents have
the same effective filing date, the first filed and issued
application claims a specie and the later filed application
claims a genus. The court held that in that situation the
later genus claim is unpatentable under the doctrine of
obviousness—type double patenting over the earlier specie
claim.

The present case is similar to Lilly in that the Sorenson
references and the present application have the same effective
filing date, the earlier filed and issued Sorenson patents
claim species, and the present application claims a genus
which encompasses the species. In the present case it is the
compositions themselves which have a specie—genus
relationship, rather than the uses having that relationship as
in Lilly. As explained in Lilly and the cases relied upon
therein, in such a situation the genus is considered to be
unpatentable over the specie under the doctrine of

obviousness—type double patenting. See Lilly, 222 F.3d at

987, 55 USPQ2d at 1619.
