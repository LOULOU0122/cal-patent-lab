under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over (1) Preiss in
view of Harris and Ponczek and (2) Preiss in view of Harris,
Ponczek and Akeyoshi, Ballentine or Jin, and reversed the
examiner's rejections of claims 8 through 12 under 35 U.S.C. §
103 as being unpatentable over (1) Preiss in view of Harris,
Ponczek, Wetterhorn and MIL—STD—454F and (2) Preiss in View of
Harris, Ponczek, Wetterhorn and Akeyoshi, Ballentine or Jin.

We have carefully considered the arguments raised by
appellant in the request for rehearing, however, those
arguments do not persuade us that our decision was in error in
any respect.

The first argument (pages 1 and 2) raised by appellant is
that “appellants' ‘joint’ is comprised of solder that
fractures to allow a controlled release and is not dependent
nor structurally equivalent” to the plug taught by Ponczek
(emphasis original). Specifically, appellant calls our
attention to Ponczek’s teaching that the pressure relief valve
78 “blows” upon a predetermined increase in pressure within
the housing 11 (col. 4, lines 6 and 7) while claim 1 calls for

a “joint” comprised of solder that fractures at a

“predetermined value of overpressure” to release the
overpressure “at a selectively controlled rate."

We are not persuaded by this argument, which we view as
another attempt to establish nonobviousness by attacking the
references individually when the rejection is predicated upon
a combination of prior art disclosures. See Paper No. 14,
page 12. While Ponczek does disclose that the pressure relief
valve 78, which includes rivet 82 and resilient adhesive 85,
will actuate or “blow” upon a predetermined increase in
pressure, the reference does not suggest that this actuation
must be explosive for the pressure relief valve to operate
properly. The affirmed rejections are based on the combined
teachings of Preiss, Harris and Ponczek. As appellant
recognizes (request for rehearing, page 2), Harris
specifically teaches a plug 16 for controlling the admission
of gases to a Bourdon gauge to safeguard the Bourdon tube
against rupture. We cannot find in the record either evidence
or a well—reasoned argument why Ponczek’s pressure relief
valve would not be capable of releasing an overpressure

condition in a Bourdon tube at a selectively controlled rate

where the Bourdon tube inlet is provided with a throttling
plug as taught by Harris.

At page 3 of the request for rehearing, appellant repeats
assertions made in the main and reply briefs (Paper Nos. 10
and 12, respectively), namely, that the pressure relief valve
78 of Ponczek could not be used in a Bourdon tube without
adversely affecting the tube, that the combination would
render Preiss3 inoperative or unsatisfactory for its intended
purpose and lack of motivation to combine the teachings of the
references. These assertions were duly considered and found
to be wanting for the reasons expressed on pages 9 through 11
of our decision. Simply put, the appellant's arguments are no
more persuasive now than they were before.

The appellant's request is granted to the extent of
reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to

making any changes therein.

3 Actually, the request for rehearing (page 4) refers to Ponczek as
being rendered unsatisfactory for its intended purpose. We presume the
reference to Ponczek is a typographical error and appellant intended to refer
to Preiss, since the rejections of claims 1 and 2 were based on a proposed
modification of Preiss, not Ponczek.
