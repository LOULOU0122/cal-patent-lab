AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte KENNETH L. BERGER

Appeal No. 1998-2066
Application No. 08/315,629

ON BRIEF

Before MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, NASE and
GONZALES, Administrative Patent Judges.

GONZALES, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING
This is in response to the appellant's request for
rehearingl (hereinafter "request") of our decision mailed June

29, 2000 (Paper No. 40), wherein we affirmed, inter alia, the

1 Filed August 28, 2000.

examiner's rejections of claims 1 through 4 and 8 through 20
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, and of claim 7 under

35 U.S.C. § 135(b). The request seeks an order (1) remanding the
application to the examiner with instructions to reopen
prosecution as to the § 112, second paragraph, issues; and (2)
reversing the examiner's rejection of claim 7 under 35 U.S.C.

§ 135(b).

The appellant seeks a remand with instruction to the
examiner to enter the amendment filed December 5, 1997, because
of a “clear factual error" (emphasis original) by the examiner.
See the request, p. 3. However, the appellant has failed to
identify any error on the part of the examiner which necessitates
a remand in this case.

The examiner's indication in the advisory action mailed
November 7, 1997 (Paper No. 34), that the 35 U.S.C. § 112, second
paragraph, rejection of claims 8, 14 and 20 had been overcome by
the amendment filed with the brief on August 4, 1997, which
amendment was refused entry, was an error.2 However, this error
was certainly not the reason for the appellant's failure to

present arguments in the brief concerning the § 112, second

 

2 Instead, the examiner should have indicated the status of claims 8, 14

and 20, if the proposed amendments to those particular claims were filed in a
separate paper. See MPEP §§ 714.13 and 1207.

paragraph, issues, since the error occurred after the brief was
filed. Nor does the error explain the appellant's failure to
file a timely reply brief addressing the § 112, second paragraph,
issues after having received the advisory action mailed November
7, 1997 and the examiner's answer repeating the § 112, second
paragraph, rejection of claims 1 through 4 and 8 through 20.

We also note that the advisory action mailed December 18,
1997, does not state that the appellant's brief was untimely.
Rather, it clearly states that “the proposed amendment filed
December 5, 1997 is not timely and cannot be considered and/or
entered.” See Paper No. 37, p. 2.3

Under 35 U.S.C. § 134 and 37 CFR § 1.191, appeals to the
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences are taken from the
decision of the primary examiner to reject claims. We exercise
no general supervisory power over the examining corps and
decisions of primary examiners to deny entry of amendments are

not subject to our review. ee 37 CFR § 1.127 and Manual of

Patent Examining_Procedure (MPEP) §§ 1002.02(c) and 1201 (7th

 

3 37 can § 1.116(b) reads:

If amendments touching the merits of the application or patent under
reexamination are presented after final rejection, or after appeal has
been taken, or when such amendment might not otherwise be proper, they
may be admitted upon a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they
are necessary and were not earlier presented.

ed., rev. 1, Feb. 2000); In re Mindick, 371 F.2d 892, 894, 152
USPQ 566, 568 (CCPA 1967) and In re Deters, 515 F.2d 1152, 1156,
185 USPQ 644, 648 (CCPA 1975). Were we to grant the appellant's
request, we would, in effect, he overruling the examiner's
decision to refuse entry of the amendment filed December 5, 1997.
We decline to take such action. Accordingly, the request for a
remand is denied.

In our earlier decision we compared appealed claim 7, which
corresponds to claim 1 of the Muller patent, to the appellant's
original claims 1 through 5 and determined that the subject
matter of the appellant's original claims 1 through 5 is directed
to an invention that is not “substantially the same” as the
invention claimed in claim 7. Specifically, we found that none
of the appellant's original claims 1 through 5 contain any
express language directed to “a circumferential groove having a
first radial depth and a second radial depth extending further
radially inwardly than said first radial depth,” which based on
the file history of the Muller patent we concluded is a material
part of the subject matter of claim 7.

The request alleges (request, p. 9) that “Muller's claim 1
and appellant's claim 1 are for substantially the same subject
matter.” In support, the appellant refers to his specification

and drawings and to the language “indentation means being




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2066
Application No. 08/315,629

positioned below said rim at a location adjacent said opening in
said top” in claim 1 and “an indentation in said wall portion to
accommodate the lower lip of a consumer” in claim 5.

We, of course, were aware of the language of original claims
1 and 5 at the time of our original decision. Nevertheless, the
fact remains that the language of the appellant's original claims

\\

l and 5 does not require a circumferential groove having a first
radial depth and a second radial depth extending further radially
inwardly than said first radial depth.”

The appellant also refers to his original specification and
drawings as providing support for the limitation. However, the
issue of support for the limitation in the appellant's
specification, or Muller's for that matter, is not an issue that
we must decide in order to determine whether or not claim 7 is
properly rejected under 35 U.S.C. § l35(b).

In conclusion, as to the requested rehearing of our
underlying decision, we have carefully and fully reconsidered
that decision in light of all of the commentary in the request.
However, for the reasons discussed above, we are not persuaded
to alter that earlier decision. Therefore, the request for

rehearing is granted to the extent of reconsidering our decision,

but is denied with respect to making any changes therein.

Additionally, for the reasons given above, we have denied the
appellant's request for a remand.
No period for taking any subsequent action in connection

with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).
