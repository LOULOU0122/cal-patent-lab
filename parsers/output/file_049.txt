AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte PASQUALE LEONE

Appeal No. 1999-2021
Application No. 08/615,836

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, BARRETT, and GROSS, Administrative Patent Judges}
THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE§ QUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has requested that we reconsider our July 16, 2002 decision, wherein we afﬁrmed
the final rejection of claims 1-19.
Appellant argues that the Board has overlooked or n1isapprehended binding Board precedent

regarding the non—compliance of the brief and the grouping of claims (Request at pages 4-7) and

1 For purposes of rendering this decision, Administrative Patent Judge Gross has been
substituted for Administrative Patent Judge Lall, who retired subsequent to the original opinion.

that the Board has overlooked or misapprehended substantive facts regarding the factual teaching of
the cited references and the controlling law regarding the use of hindsight (Request at pages 7-16).
For

the reasons stated below, we are of the view that our prior decision is justiﬁed and we are not
persuaded by the arguments presented by appellant in the Request for Rehearing to make any
changes therein.

Specifically, appellant argues (Request at page 4) that:

Based on holdings set forth in the Ex Parte Schier and Ex Parte
Ohsumi decisions, and pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 1.192(d) (footnote
omitted), this case must be remanded back to the Examiner and the
Appellant must be given an opportrmity to address any ﬁndings of
non—compliance by the Examiner.

We have reviewed the facts in the J and ﬁg’ and find that the facts of this case are
different from the facts in those cases. In both of those cases, appellant had presented in the body
of the brief arguments regarding the individual claims. The issue was whether the board should
consider the individual arguments even though appellant’s grouping of the claims was inconsistent
with the individual arguments presented in the body of the brief. The Board disallowed the
consideration of the individual arguments in view of the special circumstances of the Schier case,
whereas the Board allowed the individual arguments in the Ohsunri case because the Board held
that the intent of appellant was to argue the claims individually even though the grouping was not

consistent with the arguments. In the present case, appellant has not presented any arguments

regarding the individual claims other than the conclusory statements made on page 11 of the brief.

Application No. 08/615,836

We cited authority on page 5 of ou.r decision that if the claims are not argued individually, the
Board is not under duty to treat them individually. We refer appellant to our decision on this issue
at pages 5 and 6 of our decision.

Regarding the examiner’s responsibility regarding the propriety of the grouping of claims,
we quote below the requirements for an examiner’s answer from the Manual of Patent Examining
Procedures (MPEP) § 1208 as follows:

Grouping of Claims. A statement of whether the examiner disagrees
with any statement in the brief that certain claims do not stand or fall
together, and, if the examiner disagrees, an explanation as to why
those claims are not separably patentable.

Even assuming that we go along with the examiner’s observation that the claims do not
stand or fall together and that the examiner considered the conclusory statement made on page 11 of
the brief as sufficient to appear consistent with the reasons for arguing the claims individually, it is
ultimately the Board’s responsibility to determine the propriety of the arguments regarding the
individual claims. We ﬁnd that the statements made on page 11 of the brief are merely conclusory
and there are no substantive arguments presented by appellant regarding the individual claims listed
on page 11. The examiner on the other hand has given a N1 L case of obviousness for claims
2, 5, 9, 12, 14 and 18 listed on page 11 of the brief at pages 5 and 6 of the examiner’s answer.

Since appellant has not given any rebuttal to those rejections, we find that there are no individual

arguments Q’ the patentability of those claims.

Appeal No. 1999-2021
Application No. 08/615,836

In either case, our previous treatment of claims 1 through 19 as a single group was justiﬁed
and did not constitute an error.

Next, appellant argues (Request at page 11) that “[a]lso, the Board admits that the Examiner
used hindsight to support his rejections and holds that it is lawful to use ‘permissible hindsight’ to
combine teachings from different references.”

Appellant further quotes from our decision at page 8 that:

Appellant respectfully submits that controlling case law was
misapprehended and not applied by the Board when it stated “an artisan,
with permissible hindsight, wo11ld have been motivated to modify Arshi

with the use of Guttag to free the main processor with some of the processing
graphics.”

We disagree with the appellant’s characterization of our quote. Ou.r reference to hindsight
ir1 that quotation was based on the following quotation from In re McLaughlin, infra:

However, “[a]ny judgement on obviousness is in a sense necessarily a
reconstruction based on hindsight reasoning, but so long as it takes
into account only knowledge which was within the level of ordinary
skill hr the art at the time the claimed invention was made and does
not include lcnowledge gleaned only from applicant’s disclosure, such
a reconstruction is proper.” In re McLaughlin 443 F.2d 1392, 1395,
170 USPQ 209, 212 (CCPA 1971).

Therefore, we agree with the examiner’ s rationale for combining the two references as stated
hr the examiner’s answer at page 5 and hi our decision on page 8.

Appellant further argues (Request at pages 9 to 14) that neither Arshi nor Guttag teaches the

partitioning of the speciﬁc steps of the video decoding between the hardware and the software as

claimed. We make reference to our decision at pages 6, 7 and 8 where we discuss ir1 detail the




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1999-2021
Application No. 08/615,836

justiﬁcation for making the combination of Arshi and Guttag to meet the recited limitations. For a
further clariﬁcation of our explanation in our decision, we first would like to point out that claim 1,
the representative claim, is a method claim and does not call for the structure limitations discussed
in the Request for Rehearing. Furthermore, Arshi does show a processor which extracts the motion
vectors and does perform the decompressing of the video data as noted by the examiner. Guttag on
the other hand, does show in Figure 2 a master processor 60 (that can be considered as the main
processor) which controls the graphics coprocessors 71-74. Therefore, to the extent of features
claimed in the method claim 1, the examiner's position of combining Arshi with Guttag is proper
and meets the recited limitation.

For the reasons stated above, we are not persuaded by appe]1ant’s arguments in the Request
for Rehearing to the extent that our decision needs any modification to be made therein.

Accordingly, appel1ant’s request has been granted to the extent that our decision has been

considered, but such request is denied with respect to making any modiﬁcations to the decision.
No time period for taldng any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended
under 37 CFR § l.l36(a).
