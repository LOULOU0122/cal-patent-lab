EX parte JASON GOLDENBERG

Appeal No. 2005-1063
Application No. l0/l26,9l0

ON BRIEF

Before FRANKFORT, NASE, and BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.

FRANKFORT, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to appellant's request for rehearing
of our decision mailed June 24, 2005, wherein we affirmed the
examiner's rejection of claim l under 35 U.S.C. § l03(a) as
being unpatentable over the combined teachings of Jelling (U.S.
3,l8l,773) and Paulsen (U.S. 5,950,818). Claim l is the only
claim pending in the application.

We have carefully considered each of the points of argument
raised by appellant in the request for rehearing, however, those
arguments do not persuade us that we overlooked or misapprehended

any points raised in the appeal, or that our merits based

determination on the patentability of claim l of the present
application is in error.

Appellant's main point of argument appears to be that there is
inadequate teaching, suggestion, or motivation for the combination
of Jelling and Paulsen, because what is disclosed in Paulsen
allegedly leads away from a combination with Jelling. We do not
agree. The issue to be resolved is whether it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
appellant's invention to add serial numbering to the disposable
bags in each of the rolls (50, 52, 54) of Jelling so as to provide
the user of Jelling’s device with a means for ascertaining the
number of bags used and/or remaining on each roll. As noted on
pages 6 and 7 of our earlier decision, from the broad teachings
in Paulsen of providing serial numbering on the bags of the roll
therein “to designate the number of bags used and/or remaining
in said dispenser" (col. l, lines l3—l5), we find adequate
suggestion/motivation to utilize serial numbering on the bags in
Jelling for the purpose of keeping track of the bags used and/or
remaining on each roll. The fact that the number of bags on the
roll in Paulsen is most likely smaller than that in Jelling and
probably does not involve hundreds of bags is, in our opinion,

irrelevant. The advantage to be gained in Jelling from utilizing

a serial numbering scheme as broadly suggested in Paulsen would
have been readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art
and does not appear to depend on the particular number of bags
contained on a roll.

As for appellant's belief that a combination of primary and
secondary references requires not only a suggestion in the latter
for the combination with the former, but also “that the suggestion
requirement be reciprocal" (request, page 1). We know of no such
requirement. In evaluating the propriety of an obviousness
determination it is only necessary to ascertain whether or not
the reference teachings would appear to be sufficient for one of
ordinary skill in the relevant art having the references before him
to make the proposed substitution, combination, or modification.
It is a long—standing premise of patent law that the test for
obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference
may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the primary
reference, nor is it that the claimed invention must be expressly
suggested in any one or all of the references. Rather, the test is
what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested
to those of ordinary skill in the art at the time of appellant's
invention. See, e.g., In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425, 208 USPQ

871, 881 (CCPA 1981).

Appeal No. 2005-1063
Application No. l0/l26,9l0

In this case, we have concluded that the combined teachings of
the applied references would have suggested the subject matter of
claim l on appeal to those of ordinary skill in the art at the
time of appellant's invention.

In light of the foregoing, appellant's request is granted to
the extent of reconsidering our decision mailed June 24, 2005,
but is denied with respect to making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection
with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § l.l36(a).
