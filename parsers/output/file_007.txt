GARRIS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to a request, received August 30, 2005
for rehearing of our decision, mailed July l8, 2005, wherein we
sustained each of the section l02 and section l03 rejections
advanced by the examiner.

Our reasons for sustaining these rejections included

rebuttals to the appellants’ several arguments thereagainst

l

including the argument that, “[s]ince the examiner has held that
the claims of the instant application are not patentably distinct
from the claims of the 6,274,291 patent, and these claims have
been held allowable, the claims in the instant application are
allowable" (reply brief, page 1). In rebutting the aforequoted
argument, we stated that “[w]hether similar claims have been
allowed in U.S. Patent No. 6,274,291 is immaterial to the
patentability issue before us," (decision, pages 5-6) citing I_
re Giolito, 530 F.2d 397, 400, 188 USPQ 645, 648 (CCPA 1976). In
these respects, see the paragraph bridging pages 5 and 6 of our
decision. The subject request relates only to the above quoted
argument and our rebuttal thereof. In essence, it is the
appellants’ position in this request that we erred in determining
this argument to be unpersuasive and in relying on Giolito, id;
as support for this determination.

In this latter regard, the appellants attempt to distinguish
their factual circumstance from that of Giolito. For example,
the appellants stress that the claims of Giolito were merely
similar to those in a patent to another. However, even when the
involved claims are the same, it is simply immaterial in ex parte

prosecution that such claims have been previously allowed. See

In re Wertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 264, 191 USPQ 90, 97 (CCPA 1976).

Moreover, it is irrelevant that the involved claims are related
to the same or different inventive entities. The statutory tests
for determining patentability simply do not include whether the
same or similar claims have been previously allowed by the Patent
and Trademark Office.

Concerning this point, it is appropriate to here emphasize
that the claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,274,291 were allowed based
on prior art which did not include the NA ‘433 reference or the
1964 IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin applied by the examiner in
the present appeal. Thus, the prior art evidence which
forestalls patentability of the appellants’ claims differs from
the prior art evidence cited in the aforementioned patent. For
this reason, a denial of patentability in the former is not
inconsistent with a grant of patentability in the latter as the
appellants seem to presume.

Finally, it is significant that the appellants have cited no
authority in support of the argument under consideration in their
brief or their reply brief or the instant request for rehearing.
This is not surprising since the argument is based on an
illogical premise, namely, that claims are patentable merely
because they are not patentably distinct from previously allowed

claims. For example, this premise would lead to the illogical

Application No. 09/906,984
allowance of claims which are so broad as to be not patentably
distinct from narrow patent claims even when the broad claims
encompass prior art subject matter avoided by the narrow patent
claims.

For the above stated reasons, we continue to regard the
argument in question as unpersuasive.

The request for rehearing is denied.
