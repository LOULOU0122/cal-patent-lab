Paper No. 20

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte DOUGLAS R. PETERSON

Appeal No. 1998-2516
Application 08/422,440

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, JERRY SMITH and BARRETT, Administrative Patent
Judges.

JERRY SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING
Appellant has filed a paper under 37 37 CFR § §
l.l97(b) requesting that we reconsider our decision of October

27, 2000 wherein we affirmed the rejection of claims l—3, l2,

l3, l6, l7 and 20 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § lO3.




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2516
Application 08/422,440

Appellant points to page 7 of the original decision
wherein the Board stated that “Smith suggests that the common
mode problem in Jove can be solved by connecting a
controllable current sink across the MR element” [Request,
page 2]. Appellant essentially argues that this conclusion by
the Board is unwarranted by anything stated or shown in the
Smith reference. Appellant also presents an analysis of the
proposed modification of Jove and asserts that the proposed
modification either would not work at all or would seriously
degrade the performance of the Jove amplifier [;g;, pages 3-
6].

We have reconsidered our decision of October 27, 2000
in light of appellant's comments in the request for rehearing,
and we find no error therein. We, therefore, decline to make
any changes in our prior decision for the reasons which
follow.

The majority of appellant's request for rehearing
raises factual questions resulting from the examiner's and the
Board's modification of Jove using the teachings of Smith.
These factual questions are being raised for the first time in

this request for rehearing and have not been considered by the

examiner. Since appellant never raised these factual
questions with the examiner, we do not have the benefit of
the examiner's position on these questions of fact. A new
argument advanced in a request for rehearing but not advanced
in the brief or reply brief1 is not properly before the Board
because an argument advanced in such a manner has not afforded
the examiner an opportunity to respond to the new argument.
Note Ex parte Hindersinn, 177 USPQ 78

(Bd. App. 1971). Consequently, we will not consider these new
arguments of fact as a basis for changing our prior decision
in this case.

The only question properly raised by the request for
rehearing is the assertion by appellant that Smith does not
support the Board's statement that Smith suggests that the
common mode problem in Jove can be solved by connecting the
controllable current sink across the MR element. As noted in
the original decision, Smith specifically refers to the Jove

patent relied on and notes the problem caused by common mode

DC and low frequency components [Smith, column 2, line 62 to
column 3, line 17]. Smith notes that the arrangement in Jove
still requires coupling capacitors to connect the Jove

amplifier to other amplification circuitry.

Application O8/422,440

Smith describes a solution to Jove’s problem caused by
common mode DC and low frequency components. This solution is
achieved by coupling a controllable current sink to one end of
the MR element. Smith discloses that the feedback loop
comprising the controllable current sink controls common mode
DC and low frequency components, and effectively performs the
function of a coupling capacitor [column 11, lines 15-23].
Thus, the second feedback loop of Smith functions as a
replacement for the coupling capacitor alleged to be necessary
in Jove while still controlling common mode DC and low
frequency components.

Our inquiry in the original decision and our inquiry
now only concerns the nonobviousness of the invention as
broadly recited in claim 12. We still agree with the examiner
that the broad modification of Jove to include a feedback loop
comprised of a controllable current sink to solve the
recognized problem caused by common mode DC and low frequency
components would have been obvious to the artisan based on the

suggestions of Smith. The arguments of appellant properly

as a single group with claim 1.

raised in the brief and considered in our original decision
are not convincing of error in the examiner's rejection.

We have carefully considered the arguments raised by
appellant in the request for rehearing, but we can find no
errors in our original decision. We are still of the view
that the invention set forth in claim 1 would have been
obvious within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 103 in view of the
collective teachings of Jove and Smith.

We have granted appellant's request to the extent that
we have reconsidered our decision of October 27, 2000, but we
deny the request with respect to making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R.
§ l.l36(a).
