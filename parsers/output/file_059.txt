ON BRIEF

Before STAAB, MCQUADE, and BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.

MCQUADE, Administrative Patent Judge.

0 U FO HE G
Pursuant to 37 CFR § l.l97(b), Harry Bussey, III et al.
request rehearing (i.e., reconsideration) of our decision on
appeal rendered September 20, 2001 to the extent that we
sustained the examiner's 35 U.S.C. § l03(a) rejection of

independent claims 1 and 26 as being unpatentable over U.S.

Appeal No. 2001-1381
Application 08/826,741

Patent No. 2,345,072 to Rosenleaf et al. (Rosenleaf) in view

of U.S. Patent No. 5,207,138 to Sato et al. (Sato)?

At issue is whether the combined teachings of Rosenleaf
and Sato would have suggested a machine meeting the
limitations in claims 1 and 26 requiring a base roll for
supporting the conveyed web during passage through the
perforating or severing station. In the decision, we
concluded that they would “because the web passing through
Rosenleaf’s machine is necessarily supported by the lower
rotor [base roll] 16 via one of its knives 17-20 during the
perforating or severing operation . . . . In this regard,
the limitations at issue do not require direct contact between
the base roll and the conveyed web” (page 8). Essentially
repeating arguments earlier made in their briefs, the
appellants dispute that the web passing though the Rosenleaf
machine is so supported by rotor 16. According to the

appellants,

1 In the decision, we also sustained the examiner's 35

U.S.C. § 103(a) rejection of dependent claims 3, 9 through 11,
13, 28 and 31 through 34 as being unpatentable over Rosenleaf
in view of Sato.

[t]he knives easily slice through [Rosenleaf’s]
plaster board [web] without giving any support to
the plaster board.

As noted in Appellant's [sic] Reply Brief at
page 2, if a knife 17-20 on the rotor 16 of
Rosenleaf cuts or perforates the plaster board, it
cannot be said that the knife also supports the
plaster board. The terms “cutting” and
“perforating” each means that there is a relative
[vertical] movement between the knife and the
plaster board. The term “support” means that there
is no relative [vertical] movement between the knife
and the plaster board.

As soon as a knife 17-20 of Rosenleaf contacts
the web of plaster board, the cutting edge of the
knife (shown serrated in Fig 1) cuts into the
plaster board. As such, the knife and particularly
the serrated knife edge cannot support the web
[request, page 4].

Before addressing the substance of this argument, we f
it necessary to remark on the following passage in the
appellants’ request:

[i]t appears that the decision has not agreed
with the Examiner's reasons for rejecting claims 1
and 26 as being unpatentable over Rosenleaf in view
of Sato. That is to say, the BPAI agrees that it
would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill
in the art to eliminate the cradle frame 112 of
Rosenleaf and to provide the Rosenleaf device with a
base roll moving means for moving the base roll
vertically out of position with the upper perforator
roll during a non—cutting phase in order to insure
that there is no interference between the lower base
roll and the web. Instead, the decision appears to
hold that Rosenleaf alone teaches that the plaster
board is supported by the rotor 16 during a
perforating or cutting operation, i.e. when the

cradle frame 112 is lowered out of the orbit of the

knives 17-20. This was not the issue of the Final

Rejection [page 3].

The foregoing takes great liberties with what we actually
stated. As pointed out on page 6 in the decision, the
appellants did not challenge the propriety of the proposed
combination of Rosenleaf and Sato. Hence, we found it
unnecessary to comment on same, and did not in fact do so. As
indicated above, the issue on appeal with respect to claims 1
and 26 was, and is, whether the combined teachings of
Rosenleaf and Sato respond to the base roll web—supporting
limitations in these claims. Given Rosenleaf’s status as the
primary reference in the proposed combination and the
character of the unchallenged modifications
advanced by the examiner in view of Sato, this question boils
down to whether Rosenleaf’s rotor 16 meets the subject
limitations. The examiner's position that rotor 16 does meet
these limitations appears in both the final rejection and
answer (Paper Nos. 17 and 20).

As for the merits of the examiner's determination, we

remain of the view that “the web passing through Rosenleaf’s

machine is necessarily supported by the lower rotor 16 via one

of its knives 17-20 during the perforating or severing
operation" (decision, page 8). Even if the appellants’ bald
assertion that Rosenleaf’s knives easily slice through the
plaster board web is taken at face value, it simply does not
follow that the knives fail to provide at least some support
to the web. The nature of plaster board and the engagement of
the knives with the bottom thereof provide reasonable factual
support for concluding that the knives, and hence the rotor or
roller 16 mounting the knives, support the web however
fleetingly. Contrary to the appellants’ contention, there is
nothing in claims 1 and 26 or in the ordinary and accustomed
meaning of the term “support” which excludes the relative
vertical movement between Rosenleaf’s knives and the web which
admittedly occurs during the perforating or severing
operation. Simply put, this argument, and the

appellants’ position as a whole that Rosenleaf’s rotor 16 does
not respond to the web supporting limitations in claims 1 and
26, rest on an improper attempt to read limitations from the

specification into these claims.

In summary, we have reconsidered our decision to the

extent indicated above, but decline to make any changes

therein.
