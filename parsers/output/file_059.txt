Ex parte RAVI IYER

Appeal No. 2001-0336
Application No. 09/059,865

ON BRIEF

Before SMITH, FLEMING, and GROSS, Administrative Patent Judges.

FLEMING, Administrative Patent Judge.

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has made two requests for rehearing, the first is
Paper No. 19 and the second is Paper No. 21. We will answer both
in this decision. In the first request, Appellant requests that
we reconsider our decision mailed on September 25, 2002, with
respect to affirming the Examiner's decision rejecting claims 18

through 23 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

Appeal No. 2001-0336
Application No. 09/059,865

Appellant argues on pages 1 through 5 of the request that
the Board held that the term "stringer" means undesirable
residual non—dielectric material in accordance with the meaning
found in the specification and in accordance with the manner in
which the term is commonly understood by those of ordinary skill
in the art of semiconductor fabrication. Appellant points to
page 13, line 29 to page 14, line 2 of the specification which
describes stringers as being undesirable because they cause
problems, such as gate leakage for example. Appellant directs
the Board to page 22 of Plasma Processing Material; Scientific
Opportunities and Technological Challenges, Exhibit 1, which
describes "stringer" residue as being undesirable residual non-
dielectric material.

Upon our careful review of the specification and extrinsic
evidence now made of record, we agree with the Appellant that the
proper meaning of the claimed term "stringer" is an undesirable
residual non—dielectric material. We note that claim 12 requires
the limitation "removing a portion of the layer of non—dielectric
material, leaving stringers of the non—dielectric material in the
creases." We find that the scope of this limitation is removing
a portion of the layer of non—dielectric material, leaving an

undesirable residual non—dielectric material in the creases.

Claims 13 through 17 also recite this limitation due to their
dependence on claim 12.

As we have found on page 14 of our opinion, claim 18
includes the limitation of "removing a portion of the non-
dielectric material from the creases using a given method, the
given method leaving undesirable residual non—dielectric material
in some of the creases. Claims 19 through 23 also recite this
limitation due to their dependence on claim 18.

Appellant argues that Kim's silicon spacer is not an
undesirable residual non—dielectric material as required by
Appellant's claims. Appellant points out that in Kim's first
embodiment of Figure 1, the silicon spacer 18 is actually present
in the final device and used to fill part of the contact hole.
Appellant points out that even in Kim's second embodiment of
Figure 2, if it were not for the silicon spacer 18, the thermal
oxide spacer 19 could not be formed. Appellant argues in both
embodiments, the silicon spacer 18 is purposely created, useful,
desirable, and necessary for successful implementation of the Kim
device. see page 7 of the request.

We agree that Kim's spacer 18 cannot read on Appellant's

claimed undesirable residual non—dielectric material. Therefore,

Application No. 09/059,865

we reverse the rejection of claims 12 through 23 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103.

Appellant filed a second request for rehearing which
presents a Terminal Disclaimer, not before us at the time of our
decision. The second rehearing requests that we reconsider our
decision of the rejection under obviousness—type double patenting
in light of this Terminal Disclaimer. We will not reconsider our
decision because the Board will only consider a single request
for rehearing and the Board will only consider matters that the
Board misapprehended or overlooked in rendering our decision as
per 37 CFR § l.l97(b). The newly presented Terminal Disclaimer
was not before us when we rendered our decision and it would be
improper for us to consider it now.

Appellant's first request for rehearing is granted and the

second request is denied.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
