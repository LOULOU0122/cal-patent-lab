Paper No. 34

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte MARCUS R. SKEEM, SERGEJ-TOMISLAV BULJAN and
JEAN KRAMP

Appeal No. 2000-0207
Application 08/892,836

ORDER REMANDING TO EXAMINER

An Information Disclosure Statement (IDS) was filed July 5,
1997 (Paper No. 18). It is not apparent from the record that the
examiner properly considered the IDS submitted in accordance with
the criteria set forth in 37 CFR §§ 1.97 and 1.98.

Further, a first declaration (attached to Paper No. 11) and
a petition to change inventorship (Paper No. 14) were filed June
2, 1997. There is no indication in the record that either
submission has been considered by the examiner.

In addition, Amendment B filed June 2, 1997 (Paper No. 11)
was approved for entry by the examiner in his office action of

June 12, 1997 (Paper No. 13). The amendment remains unentered.

Appeal No. 2000-0207
Application O8/892,836

The copy of Claim 28 as submitted in Appellants’ Brief and
indicated by the examiner to be a correct copy does not appear to
agree with the claim presented by appellants in their amendment
filed on June 2, 1997 in Paper No. 11. The first two lines of
part (c) should read as follows: “c) a first uppermost cutting
level comprising superabrasive gains and successive uppermost

cutting levels among the plurality of cutting levels of each

tooth;”.
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that the application is remanded to the
Examiner for the following matters:

(1) consideration of the IDS (Paper No. 18) in accordance
with the pertinent rules;

(2) consideration of the Declaration (attached to
Paper No. ll);

(3) consideration of the petition to change inventorship
(Paper No. 14);

(4) appropriate entry of Amendment B (Paper No. ll);

(5) correction of the appendix of claims on appeal so as to
include a correct copy of appealed claim 28; and

(6) for such further action as may be appropriate.
