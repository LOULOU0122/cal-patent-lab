Paper No. 18

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte CHI-HUEY WONG

Appeal No. 1999-1331
Application No. 08/547,602

ON BRIEF

Before ROBINSON, SCHEINER, and MILLS, Administrative Patent Judges.
ROBINSON, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests reconsideration (rehearing) of the board's decision entered
January 30, 2001, wherein the examiner's rejection of the appealed claims under 35
U.S.C. § 103 was affirmed.

In effect, appellant's request is premised upon assertions that the board failed to
consider and properly weigh the evidentiary relevance of Green, failed to disclose a
basis for affirming the rejection as to claim 15 and applied an improper standard with

regard to appellant's allegation of unexpected cost savings.

Appeal No. 1999-1331
Applition No. 08/547,602

We would, initially, note that appellant is correct concerning the typographical
error page 4, second sentence which refers to "L-fuculose isomerase" rather the correct
term "fucose isomerase."

To the extent that appellant presents arguments with respect to the deficiency of
Green as to whether the description should be read as describing a fucose isomerase,
we would note that these arguments were not presented in this manner in either the
Appeal Brief or the Reply Brief. We would note that appellant had raised a similar
argument in the paragraph bridging pages 4-5 of the response filed July 8, 1997 (Paper
No. 7). It would appear that this argument was directed to the patentability of at least
claim 1, which was pending in the application at that time, and which required the use of
a puriﬁed L-fucose isomerase. That limitation is not present in the claims currently
pending in this application. However, the examiner responded to this argument at
pages 3-4 of the Ofﬁce action of October 20, 1997 (Paper No. 8) stating :

[t]he cell-free extract disclosed by Green is encompassed by the claim

language "purified" present in claim 1. It is respectfully submitted that

unless it is clear from reading the speciﬁcation that the word "puriﬁed" is

intended to have such a meaning, the language "puriﬁed" does not mean

that the enzyme is purified to homogeneity, or by a particular process,

unless the claims so recite. Note that the examples in the speciﬁcation all

use "crude extract" (820 Units/ml) of L-fucose isomerase. See

specification at pages 27 (line 6), page 28 (line 11), page 29 (lines 13 and

14). Note also that claim 12 does not recite that the enzyme is puriﬁed.

Thus, the language "puriﬁed" in claim 1 does not distinguish the claimed
process from that suggested by the cited prior art.

Appeal No. 1999-1331
Application No. 08/547,602

Appellant did not renew these arguments, or take issue with the examinefs conclusion
stated in the Final Rejection, in either the Brief or Reply Brief. Thus, these arguments
are not properly before us. 37 CFR § 1.192(a)(1998)("Any arguments or authorities not
included in the brief will be refused consideration by the Board of Patent Appeals and
interferences, unless good cause is shown").

As to the basis for affirmation of the rejection of claim 15, we refer to that portion
of the decision of January 30, 2001 appearing at page 7, first full paragraph which
addresses appealed claim 15, specifically.

As to appellant's arguments concerning the standard applied with respect to the
allegation of unexpected cost savings, we are not persuaded that the standard applied
in our decision of January 30, 2001 was erroneous. To the extent that appellant would
seek to compare the present claimed process to a "hypothetical process" (Request,
page 6), it naturally follows that any comparison of cost savings would of necessarily be
hypothetical and of little persuasive value. We would remind appellant that as set forth
in In re Wright, 999 F.2d 1557, 1563, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1514-15 (Fed. Cir. 1993),
evidence which is in the nature of unsupported conclusory statements as to the ultimate
legal question is entitled to little if any weight.

We have carefully reviewed the original opinion in light of appellant's request, but
we find no point of law or fact which we overlooked or misapprehended in arriving at our
decision. To the extent relevant, appellant's request amounts to a reargument of points

already considered by the board.

Application No. 08/547,602

Therefore, appellant's request has been granted to the extent that the decision

has been reconsidered, but such request is denied with respect to making any

modifications to the decision affirming the examiner's rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal

may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).
