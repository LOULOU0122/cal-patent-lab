UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte DONALD K. FOREST

Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

REMAND

Before THOMAS, JERRY SMITH and LEVY, Administrative Patent Judges.

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ORDER VACATING REJECTION
AND REMANDING TO THE EXAMINER
Pursuant to 37 CFR § l.l96(a) and the Manual of Patent

Examining Procedure (MPEP) § l2ll, this application is remanded to
the examiner for appropriate action with respect to the matters
discussed below. Because the present rejection of the claims on
appeal is considered by us to be not appropriate and not ripe for

our review, we VACATE the rejection of the claims on appeal under




*** PAGE 2 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

35 U.S.C. § 103 and remand the application in view of the following.
Essentially, we have concluded that the examiner has failed to
establish a prima facie case of obviousness as to any claim on
appeal.

Preliminarily, we note the following. The present application
contains a specification of over 130 pages with 67 drawing figures.
There are approximately 150 claims on appeal with 39 of these being
independent claims. The brief is approximately 200 pages long and
appears to argue each claim on appeal. The reply brief is 72 pages.
The examiner relies upon seven references to formulate a rejection
under 35 U.S.C. § 103, and the answer is over 20 pages.

At page 3 of the answer, the examiner sets forth the rejection
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 by relying upon all seven references together
to reject each claim on appeal. Beginning at this page of the
answer, the examiner has only briefly detailed some features of each
of the respective references relied upon. Initially, at least two
separate portions of Ito are discussed briefly. Since the examiner
considers this first reference as not explicitly disclosing a
certain feature, the examiner then relies upon a second, different
reference at page 4 of the answer. This practice is repeated again
by asserting that the primary reference does not disclose a

different feature and a tertiary reference is therefore found

Application 08/506,032

obvious to combine with the initial reference to Ito. The statement
is made at the top of page 5 that the primary reference to Ito "as
modified" does not teach certain features, to which the examiner
relies upon two additional references, arguing their combinability
within 35 U.S.C. § 103. It is not clear to us in each instance in
which the examiner uses the term "Ito as modified," what the
examiner is referring to that has been previously recited since this
terminology is used in multiple locations. The examiner continues
with this approach until all of the seven references have been
considered together, each separately with Ito.

Beginning at page 6 of the answer, the examiner then considers
various combinations of the references relating to particular
independent claims. This appears to conflict with the examiner's
assertion at page 3 of the answer, which states that all claims are
rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being obvious in view of all seven
references relied on. Moreover, the assertions made with respect to
each of the seven references at pages 3-6 of the answer fail to set
forth any context or claimed feature of any identifiable claim on
appeal for which a specific reference is relied upon to meet. The
examiner's attempted correlation beginning at page 6 of the answer
to respective independent claims fails to assert what is taught in

any given reference with respect to what is claimed in any of these

3

Application O8/506,032

independent claims, what is not taught in the reference or
references relied on that is claimed, and then what is taught or
suggested with respect to each of the additional references relied
upon that is set forth in each of these independent claims. The
combinability of the references has not been stated with respect to
any feature claimed.

The examiner has essentially only set forth a broad—brush
approach to reject the claims on appeal. Stated differently, each
claim limitation of each independent claim on appeal has not been
respectively mapped to each of the reference's teachings and/or
showings in the drawings in a detailed manner. Thus, the examiner
has not fully explained the rationale for the rejection under
35 U.S.C. § 103 for each of the independent claims on appeal.
Following this approach, it is apparent to us that the examiner has
not set forth a prima facie case of obviousness for each of the
independent claims on appeal.

At page 7 of the answer the examiner makes reference to the
dependent claims indicating "they are also rejected for the same
reasons as set forth in the rejection above." There is no detailed
discussion of the features recited in each of the noted dependent
claims with respect to any of the references relied upon as a basis

to reject them. Moreover, the examiner has stated at page 8 of the




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

answer that "[s]ince appellant has [sic, an] unreasonable number of
claims in the file, it is a burden on the examiner to address all
single claims, but the examiner has attempted to address all the
independent claims." The examiner's "attempt" to address all the
independent claims has, as noted above, been found to not set forth
a prima facie case of obviousness within 35 U.S.C. § l03.
Similarly, it is apparent that, because of the number of claims on
appeal, the examiner has not addressed all the dependent claims
because "it is a burden on the examiner to address all single
claims." We therefore conclude that the examiner has failed to set
forth a prima facie case of obviousness as to all the dependent
claims on appeal as well.
The examiner is free to reinstitute any rejections under

35 U.S.C. § l03 on the basis of the presently applied or any new,
different prior art. In any event, for each reference relied on

in each rejection, the PTO's policy is for the examiner to

compare the rejected claims feature—by—feature or limitation—by—
limitation with each of the references relied upon in the
rejection. This comparison should map the language of the claims
to the specific page number, column number, line number, drawing

number, drawing reference number, and/or quotation from each




*** PAGE 6 ***

Application 08/506,032

reference relied upon. Note MPEP § 706.02(j) and MPEP § 1208 for
the correct methodologies.

It is not the Board's burden or the burden of any panel of
this Board to initially assert and to even formulate the details
of a prima facie case of obviousness within 35 U.S.C. 103. This

burden of proof rests solely upon the examiner. Note, e.g.,

In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed.
Cir. 1992).

The examiner may choose to first avail himself or herself of
the provisions of 37 CFR § 1.75(b) and the discussion thereof
within MPEP § 2173.05(n) as to the examiner's characterization at
page 8 of the answer that there are an "unreasonable number of
claims in the file." As noted in subsection (b) of 37 CFR
§ 1.75, the claims must differ substantially from each other AND
not be unduly multiplied. To the extent the examiner may
determine that the claims do not differ substantially from each
other, then they are in inherently unduly multiplied and not in
compliance with this rule. The analysis as to this rule proceeds
by first comparing each independent claim for relative compliance
with this rule, then to a corresponding comparison of the

dependent claims.

Appeal No. 2000-1901
Application 08/506,032

In summary, the present rejection of all claims on appeal
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 is VACATED. Additionally, this application
is remanded to the examiner for further action consistent with
the foregoing.
