Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

Dance has requested reconsideration and modification
of various aspects of our FINAL DECISION AND JUDGMENT UNDER 37
CFR § 1.658(a), mailed June 20, 2000 (hereinafter, Decision).
Seifert opposes the request in all respects. For the
following reasons, Dance's request for modification of the
Decision is denied in all respects.

A. Dance's alleged diligence and actual reduction to practice

In the Decision at 11-15, we held that Dance's and
Dennis’ declarations and exhibits establish conception of the
subject matter of the count as of October 9, 1989, prior to
Seifert's February 2, 1990, filing date, but fail to prove
diligence during the critical period running from just before
Seifert's filing date (considered to be the date of Seifert's
entry in the field for the purpose of evaluating Dance's
priority case) up to Dance's September 18, 1990, filing date
(Decision at 15-16). As evidence of diligence, Dance relied
on the description in Dance's declaration of the preparation
of a number of documents prepared during the critical period

(Dance Decl. at JR3 17-18, l 10). We held this testimony

3 Junior party Dance's record.

_2_




*** PAGE 3 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

insufficient to prove diligence because "[n]one of these
documents have been introduced into evidence, let alone with
authenticating testimony by someone other than Dance.
Furthermore, the preparation of these documents is not

corroborated by Dennis or anyone else.

(Decision at 17.) Dance argues that

the sequence of acts listed in the Dance
Declaration, since they are nowhere rebutted, must
be taken as established for purposes of this
proceeding. Clearly, to the extent corroboration is
needed, the filing date of the Dance application is
corroborated. Since Seifert in no way challenged
the sufficiency of the assertions of the Dance
Declaration on any basis[,] the Board is asked to
recognize that diligence, to the extent it is
needed, has been established as not having been
objected to or otherwise disproved by Seifert.
[Request at 3.]

This argument places the burden of proof on the wrong party.
It is Dance, as the party seeking to establish a date of
invention prior to Seifert's filing date, who bears the burden
of proving diligence, 37 CFR § l.657(a) and § l.657(b), which
like conception must be corroborated. Brigg v. Symsek, 988
F.2d 1187, 1196, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
Seifert was not required prior to filing his brief to identify

the perceived weaknesses in Dance's priority evidence, with

_3_




*** PAGE 4 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

the exception of objecting under § l.672(c) to its
admissibility‘ if he intended to later move under § l.656(h)
to suppress it on that ground. As Seifert filed no such
motion, he was not required to file a S 1.672(c) objection.
Seifert's contention that Dance's testimony about the

documents cited as proof of diligence lacks

corroboration does not raise an admissibility issue and thus
need not have been noticed by way of an objection under

§ l.672(c). Also, the admissibility of the documents
themselves was never at issue, because they were not included
in Dance's record.

Dance alternatively argues that a showing of
diligence is unnecessary because the drawings which we held
are sufficient to prove conception as of October 9, 1989, are
also sufficient to establish an actual reduction to practice
as of that date in accordance with Dance's preliminary
statement, which asserts that the invention was actually

reduced to practice on or before March 15, 1990 (Request at 2-

4

Admissibility is governed by the Federal Rules of

Evidence, which are made applicable to interference proceedings by
§ l.67l(b).

3). Dance's reliance on the preliminary statement is improper
because it is not evidence. 37 CFR § l.629(e). Furthermore,
the contention that the evidence establishes an actual
reduction to practice fails because this evidence does not
establish that (1) prior to Seifert's filing date, Dance
constructed an embodiment that met every element of the
interference count and (2) this embodiment operated for its
intended purpose. Eaton v. Evans, 204 F.3d 1094, 1097,

53 USPQ2d 1696, 1698 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

B. The timeliness of Dance‘: motion to strike the initial
reissue declarations of Seifert, Downey, and shank

At pages 31-33 of the Decision, we held that Dance
has not shown good cause under § 1.645(b) for waiting five and
one—half months after the oral hearing to file the motion to
strike the initial reissue declarations of Seifert, Downey,
and Shank on the ground that they contain inadmissible hearsay
due to absence of a supporting declaration by Seifert's
counsel, Mr. Bookstein. We treated this motion as a motion to
suppress evidence under § 1.656(h), which specifies that such
a motion is due with the moving party's opening brief.

Dance's argument that the motion should be considered timely

because "it was only from and after that October 14, l999[,]

_5_




*** PAGE 6 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

hearing date that it was absolutely clear that no further
declaration from Attorney Bookstein would ever be submitted"
(Motion at 4) was rejected on the ground that "Dance knew as
of the due date for his opening brief, which was subsequent to
the close of Seifert's testimony period, that no Bookstein
declaration had been filed" (Decision at 33). Dance now
argues (Request at 3-4) that
[t]he rules must not be that unambiguous on
the point of when it is absolutely clear
that such a declaration would not be
forthcoming because, as is noted by the
Board on the top of page 31 from Seifert's
brief, apparently with approval[:]
[]No supporting declaration was filed
by Bookstein, although Seifert's brief
for final hearing states that "should
it become necessary or desirable to do
so, such a declaration can and will be
furnished[."]
Our observation that Seifert's brief included an offer to file
a Bookstein declaration was not intended to imply prospective
approval of that offer. This should be apparent from the fact
that the offer was mentioned in the summary of the background
facts of Dance's § 1.633(a) motion for judgment under

35 U.S.C. § 251 (Decision at 28-31) rather than in the

discussion of Dance's motion to strike (id. at 31-36). All of




*** PAGE 7 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

the evidence on which Seifert intends to rely to demonstrate
compliance with 35 U.S.C. § 251 was due with the opposition to
Dance's 37 CFR § 1.633(a) motion. gee Irikura v. Petersen,

18 USPQ2d 1362, 1368 (Ed. Pat. App. & Int. 1990) ("A good
faith effort must be made to submit evidence to support a
preliminary motion or opposition when the evidence is
available. Orikasa v. Oonishi, [10 USPQ2d 1996, 2000 n.12
(Comm'r Pats. & Trademarks 1989)].") Further— more, in Paper
No. 545 (at 12) the Administrative Patent Judge advised the
parties that any new evidence submitted in connection with

previously filed motions "may be submitted with respect to

such motions only upon a showing (§ 1.635) that the evidence
was unavailable when the corresponding motion, opposition or
reply was filed. Such a motion must be filed at least 10 days
prior to the end of that party's relevant testimony period."
As no Bookstein declaration was filed by the end of Seifert's
testimony period (with or without an accompanying § 1.635

motion), Dance's motion to strike was due with his opening

5 "ADDITION OF SEIFERT CLAIM 1; SCHEDULE FOR § l.640(b)
STATEMENTS, TESTIMONY, RECORDS AND BRIEFS," mailed November 15,
1996.

Decision on Reconsideration

brief, as specified in § l.656(h). This is not altered by the
fact that Seifert's brief, which was filed after Dance's
opening brief, contains the offer to submit a Bookstein
declaration.

C. Dance's jurisdictional argument

At pages 33-35 of the Decision, we rejected Dance's

alternative argument that his belated motion to strike the
initial Seifert, Downey, and Shank reissue declarations should
be considered because "it goes fundamentally to the Patent and
Trademark Office jurisdiction with respect to this
interference. But for the existence of the reissue proceeding
which party Dance has now demonstrated was defectively
granted, the Patent and Trademark Office had no subject matter

jurisdiction to adjudicate this interference." (Motion at 5.)5

Dance does not take issue with our holding that we
have jurisdiction over the interference if it was "properly

declared" under 35 U.S.C. § l35(a), in support of which

5 Although not noted in the Decision, we should point out

that Dance's reasons for making this jurisdictional argument are
unclear; if we lack jurisdiction over this interference, we also

lack the authority to enter judgment against Seifert's reissue
claims for unpatentability under 35 U.S.C. § 251.

Decision on Reconsideration

proposition we cited In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 53 USPQ2d
1769 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and Guinn v. Ko f, 96 F.3d 1419, 40
USPQ2d 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1210
(1997) (Decision at 33). Gartside held that junior party
Forgac's amendment canceling all of his claims involved in the
interference styled as "Forgac v. Gartside" did not divest the
Board of jurisdiction over that interference and thus over
Gartside's involved claims. 203 F.3d at 1316—18, 53 USPQ2d at
1776-78. Likewise, guinn held that Guinn's statutory
disclaimer of his single claim involved in the interference
did not divest the Board of jurisdiction over the interference
and that claim. 96 F.3d at 1421-22, 40 USPQ2d at 1159-60.
Furthermore, as we explained in the Decision at pages 33-
35, the interference was "properly declared" under

§ 135(a) in accordance with Perkins v. Kwon, 886 F.2d 325,

327 & n.2, 12 USPQ2d 1308, 1309-10 & n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1989),
because (1) Seifert's reissue application was a "pending
application" under 37 CFR § l.601(i) at the time the
declaration notice was mailed and (2) the examiner, prior to
declaration of the interference, had determined that Seifert's

now involved




*** PAGE 10 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

reissue application claims 31-35 are allowable. Dance has not
explained why the interference was not "properly declared" in
accordance with Perkins and why Seifert's alleged failure to
comply with 35 U.S.C. § 251, if proved (it has not been),
should lead to a different result on the jurisdiction issue
than was reached in Gartside and Guinn.7

For the foregoing reasons, we remain of the view
that Seifert's failure to comply with the requirements of 35
U.S.C. § 251, if proved, would result in the entry of judgment
against Seifert's reissue claims for unpatentability on that
ground rather than a holding that we lack subject matter
jurisdiction over the interference.
D. Dance's "new matter" argument

At pages 40-47 of the Decision, we rejected Dance's
argument that the omission from Seifert's reissue claims of
the extension wire limitations recited in the original patent
claims constitutes "new matter" in contravention of the 35

U.S.C. § 251 (Dance's opening brief at 15). We treated this

7 See also Gustavsson v. Valentini, 25 USPQ2d 1401, 1406-07
(Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991), wherein the Board rejected
Gustavsson's argument that Valentini's admitted failure to comply
with 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) rendered the interference void ab initio.

_lO_

Decision on Reconsideration

"new matter" argument as based on the requirement of § 251

that the reissue

claims be directed to "the invention disclosed in the original
patent" and, citing Hester Indus. Inc. v. Stein Inc., 142 F.3d
1472, 1484, 46 USPQ2d 1641, 1651 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied,
525 U.S. 947 (1998), noted that this inquiry is analogous to
the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, first
paragraph (Decision at 40). After analyzing the facts in the
present case in accordance with the principles set forth in
Gentry Gallery, Inc. v. Berkline Corp., 134 F.3d 1473,

45 USPQ2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 1998), which held that the
disclosure of Gentry's patent (i.e., Sproule patent No.
5,062,244) did not provide § 112, first paragraph, written
description support for the broadened amended claim, we
concluded that Seifert's original disclosure provides written
description support for Seifert's broadened reissue claims.
Dance argues that our decision is incorrect because it ignores
U.S. Indus. Chems. Co. v. Carbide & Carbon Chems. Corp., 315
U.S. 668, 678 (1941); Russell v. Dodge, 93 U.S. 460, 463

(1876); Pattee Plow Co. v. Kingman, 129 U.S. 294, 299 (1888);

Decision on Reconsideration

and Ballew v. Watson, 129 USPQ 48, 49-50 (D.C. Cir 1961),
cited in Dance's opening brief at 16, which are characterized
in Dance's request for reconsideration (at 5) as "stand[ing]
for the principle that removal of language from the

specification [sic, claims] introduces ‘new matter’ and is

contrary to the reissue statute." This is not a fair
characterization of the holdings in these cases, which we
understand to mean that reissue claims may not be broadened to
omit features described as essential in the original patent.
For example, while Dance's opening brief (at 16) correctly
quotes U.S. Indus., the most recent of the cited Supreme Court
cases, as stating that

[t]his court has uniformly held that the

omission from a reissue patent of one of

the steps or elements prescribed in the

original, thus broadening the claims to

cover a new and different combination,

renders the reissue void, even though the

result attained is the same as that brought

about by following the process claimed in

the original patent.
(emphasis added) 315 U.S. at 678, the phrase "prescribed in

the original" must be read in conjunction with the Court's

holding that "[w]e think it plain that the reissue omitted a




*** PAGE 13 ***


Interference No. lO3,379
Decision on Reconsideration

step in the process which was described and claimed as
essential in the original patent." 315 U.S. at 677.“
Likewise, in Ballew the District of Columbia Court of Appeals

held that "we have no basis

for characterizing as clearly erroneous the finding of the
District Court that the claims in the reissue application
omitted essential elements of the original patent and were
drawn to an invention different from that intended to be
secured by the original patent." 129 USPQ at 50. For the
reasons given in the Decision at pages 40-47, we remain of the
view that the artisan would not have understood the extension
wire feature to be an essential part of Seifert's invention.
E. Dance's "recapture rule" argument

Dance contends our conclusion (Decision at 49) that
Seifert made no argument during prosecution which amounts to a

surrender of the invention recited in the reissue claims,

3 We should also point out that in contrast to current
35 U.S.C. § 251, which requires that the reissue claims be "for
the invention disclosed in the original patent," the reissue

statute involved in U,S. Indua., i.e., 35 U.S.C. § 46, required
that the reissue claims be for the "same invention." Hester,

142 F.2d at 1485, 46 USPQ2d at 1651; Ig zg Amos, 953 F.2d 613, 619
n.2, 21 USPQ2d 1271, 1275 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

_ 13 _




*** PAGE 14 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

Hester at 1481, 46 USPQ2d at 1648, is erroneous because
"Seifert made three very strident arguments in its Amendment
dated February 4, 1991 which distinguish [the claims from] the
prior art based upon the required presence of the Extension
Wire Structure" (Request at 6). We do not agree that the
arguments made in that amendment, which were discussed at
pages 49-50 of the Decision (wherein it was identified as the

amendment received February 19,




*** PAGE 15 ***


Interference No. 103,379
Decision on Reconsideration

1991), can fairly be characterized as strident arguments based
on the extension wire limitations.
For the foregoing reasons, Dance's request for

modification of our Decision is DENIED.
