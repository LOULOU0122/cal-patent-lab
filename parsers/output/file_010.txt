Patent Interference No. 102,700

FINAL HEARING: May 14, 1998

Before CAROFF, METZ, and ELLIS, Administrative Patent Judges.

CAROFF,  -

RECONSIDERATION

Gilligan et al. (Gilligan) has filed a request for
reconsideration (Paper No. 147) of our Final Decision of
September 22, 1999 (Paper No. 146). Ohsuye et al. (Ohsuye)
has filed an opposition (Paper No. l48) to Gilligan's request
for reconsideration.

Pursuant to 37 CFR § l.658(b), a decision on
reconsideration is limited to a determination of whether any
points were misapprehended or overlooked by a Board panel in
rendering a final decision. We have carefully considered the

arguments advanced in Gilligan's request for reconsideration,

Suntory Limited, Osaka, Japan, a corporation of Japan.

but we are not convinced that we misapprehended or overlooked
any points in rendering our Final Decision.

According to Gilligan, our decision was based on a
misapprehension that Gilligan "admitted" that its generic
product claims 7l—74 were not enabled by the relevant
specification. This is not correct. A careful perusal of our
decision reveals that we never implied that junior party
Gilligan "admitted" that its generic "PAM" product claims were
nonenabled. What we did say was that the party Gilligan does
not dispute the holding in the Decision on Motions (Paper No.
79) that its generic product claims 71-74 (relating to
purified PAM protein) go beyond the scope of enablement
provided in its specification. In this regard, see pages 3-4
and 7 of our Final Decision. In fact, this was made
abundantly clear by Gilligan on several occasions. For
instance, see Gilligan's Statement of Issues (Paper No. 130-
1/2), and pages 1 and 33 of Gilligan's Brief (Paper No. 138).

In the Decision on Motions (page 5), it was specifically
held that the generic product claims 71-74 are beyond the
scope of enablement provided by Gilligan's involved and parent

application. The holding of nonenablement was premised upon a




*** PAGE 4 ***


Interference No. 102,700

consideration of appropriate factors relevant in determining
whether undue experimentation would be involved in practicing
the full scope of the claimed invention. These factors
include, inter alia, the scope of the working examples, the
breadth of the claims, the nature of the invention, the state
of the prior art, and predictability or unpredictability of
the art, as enumerated in In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737, 8
USPQ2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988) and Ex parte Forman, 230
USPQ 546, 547 (BPAI 1986). Thus, the finding in the Decision
on Motions that Gilligan's generic product claims are not
enabled stands undisputed in this case. This undisputed
finding, and not any admission on the part of Gilligan, was
deemed to be a significant factor in our conclusions regarding
the patentability of Gilligan's generic method claims 76-79,
81-84 and 86-92.

Gilligan also charges us with misapprehending the
significance of statements made by party Gilligan during
prosecution of its parent application 06/655,366 in an
amendment filed on June 6, 1986 (OR 220-235). In relevant
part, Gilligan made the following statements in that

amendment:




*** PAGE 5 ***


Interference No. 102,700

The Office Action also draws the conclusion that
the presence of amidated peptides in a particular
tissue is synonymous with high levels of alpha-
amidating enzyme. This is not true. For example,
rat anterior pituitary tissue contains high alpha-
amidating activity but no known substrates [Eipper
et al., PNAS 80, 5144-5148 (l983)]. Rat posterior
pituitary tissue contains amidated peptides
(oxytocin and vasopressin) but has very little
alpha—amidating activity [Eipper et al., Endo ll6,
2497-2504 (l985)]. Therefore, until individual
tissues are tested for alpha—amidating activity, the
presence or potential levels of the enzyme can not
be anticipated. In fact, Applicants had to screen
large numbers of tumors prior to identifying a tumor
series with high levels of amidating enzyme
activity; many of them were found to be unreliable
or useless as enzyme sources. [OR—23l]

According to Gilligan, the foregoing statement relates to
difficulties encountered in developing the invention prior to
the filing date; and Gilligan insists that those difficulties
dissipated once the purification technique described in
Gilligan's specification was developed. However, as we see
it, Gilligan's statements are tantamount to an admission that
identifying sources of PAM enzyme was unpredictable at the
time the Gilligan application was filed. Gilligan has adduced
no evidence that the identification of particular sources for
the enzyme became more predictable as a result of Gilligan's
development of a purification technique for extracting the

enzyme from an identified source. Rather, by Gilligan's own

5

Interference No. 102,700

admission, there is a need to screen a large number of
potential sources, by species and tissue type, in order to
identify a suitable source of PAM enzyme. Moreover, according
to Gilligan, identification is further complicated by the fact
that detection of the presence of amidated peptides is not a
reliable indicator of the presence of the enzyme being sought.
It is not seen how the development of a particular
purification technique by Gilligan reduces the uncertainties

involved in identifying a suitable source for purification.

Interference No. 102,700

Finally, we note that Gilligan's request for
reconsideration (p. 5) includes a list of potential sources of
PAM enzyme which were mentioned in Gilligan's involved
application or in prior art publications. Gilligan's
application does list a number of publications which
purportedly report the presence of "alpha—amidating enzyme
activity" or "amidated peptides" in a variety of sources.
However, in view of the admitted lack of predictability in the
art, the presence of amidated peptides or some other sign of
alpha—amidating activity is not dispositive with regard to
identification of a useful enzyme source.

For the foregoing reasons, we decline to modify our Final
Decision in any respect.
