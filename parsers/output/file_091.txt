DIXON, Administrative Patent Judge.

RE MAND

Appellant filed an Information Disclosure Statement on April 24, 1995 (Paper No.

3). From our review ofthe prosecution history, it is not clear from the record whether
the examiner considered the statement submitted or whether the examiner notified
appellant ofwhy their submission did not meet the criteria set forth in 37 CFR §§ 1.97
and 1.98.

Accordingly, it is

ORDERED that the application is remanded to the examiner for consideration of
the Information Disclosure Statement ﬁled April 24, 1995 (Paper No. 3), for notification

to appellant of consideration, and for such further action as may be appropriate.
