Paper No. 14

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex Qarte BERNARD TICKNER

Appeal No. 2004-1268
Application No. 09/944,932

VACATUR AND REMAND

Before WILLIAM F. SMITH, ADAMS, and GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judges.
WILLIAM F. SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

This appeal involves plant patent Application No. 09/944,932. The question
raised in this appeal involves whether evidence of foreign sales of the claimed
reproducible plant variety may enable an otherwise non-enabled printed publication
disclosing the plant, thereby creating a bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). The Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered that issue in In re Elsner, 381 F.3d 1125,
72 USPQ2d 1038 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and held in the affirmative. Id_. at 1128, 72 USPQ2d
at 1041. In so holding, the court stated that “[t]he foreign sale must not be an
obscure, solitary occurrence that would go unnoticed by those skilled in the art." Q at
1131, 72 USPQ2d at 1043. The court also stated that the record did not establish that
“even if the interested public would readily know of the foreign sales, those sales

enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to reproduce the claimed plants without undue

experimentation.” jg Thus, the court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the
case for “further factual findings relati n to the accessibility of the foreign sales of the
claimed plants and the reproducibility of the claimed plants from the plants that were
sold."|_d_.

In this case, the examiner is relying upon applicant's admission that the claimed
plant “was sold in The United Kingdom as early as April 1, 1998" as evidence that
United Kingdom PBR 03000204 is enabled. Examiner's Answer, page 4. However,
there is no evidence whether the sales were of the type that would be noticed by those
of skill in the art. Nor has the other issue raised by the Federal Circuit in _E|_srﬂ,
whether the sales would enable one skilled in the art to reproduce the claimed plant
without undue experimentation, been addressed.

Accordingly, we vacate the examiner’s rejection and remand the case to the
examiner to determine whether the sales of the claimed plant (1) were “an obscure,
solitary occurrence that would go unnoticed by those skilled in the art” and (2) would

enable one to reproduce the plant without undue experimentation.
