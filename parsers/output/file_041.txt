Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

HEARD: January 24, 2001

Before THOMAS, HAIRSTON, and LEVY, Administrative Patent Judges.

THOMAS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

This is a decision on rehearing of our original decision in this appeal dated
February 12, 2001, in which we sustained the rejection of claims 1-24 under 35 U.S.C.
103. Appellant's request for rehearing was filed on April 11, 2001. In this request,
appellant presents arguments only with respect to claim 1, since the statement is made

that all remaining claims 2-24 stand or fall with claim 1 at page 6 of the request.

Page 7 of appellant's request states that the admitted prior art utilized a single
light emitting element, i.e., a laser diode. This is a more explicit statement as to what
appellant's admitted prior art utilized than we perceived from our original understanding
of the invention in the specification as filed as it pertained to prior art Figure 1.
Appellant presents the view at the bottom of page 8 of the request that the laser diodes
of the admitted prior art ideally printed a document with even toner density throughout
the document due to the use of one laser diode. Appellant also states at page 10 of the
request that in the admitted prior art, it was understood and well known in the art that a
laser printer has high resolution and printed a document with even toner density.
Appellant also characterizes, at the bottom of page 9 of the request, that the problem
associated with the admitted prior art was directed to the amount of toner attached on
the drum during a developing stage being determined by a bias voltage, where the
intensity of this bias voltage was controlled by the user by adjusting a terminal on a
control panel. This is consistent with our understanding from the identiﬁed portions of
the admitted prior art in the speciﬁcation that we noted at the top of page 4 of our
original opinion. The user's changing of the bias voltage was characterized at page 10
of the request as merely changing the density of the toner on the printed document not

the uniformity of the density.

Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

With respect to appellant's admitted prior art Figure 1, it is stated at the bottom
of page 9 of the specification as filed that the bias voltage generator unit 70 had the
adjusting terminal for adjusting the bias of that circuit. The adjusting terminal was
stated to be well known as a print density select switch on the control panel.

On the other hand, whereas appe||ant’s admitted prior art Figure 1 shows
a clock generator 40 and a dividing unit 50 to feed clocking signals to the data
transmitting unit 10, appellant utilizes a selectable first and second divider circuit in
Figure 3 in part controlled by the mode selector and the data coming in on the bus to
the left of that figure. Additionally, the chopping unit 100 has been added between the
data transmitting unit 10 and the print control unit 20 as shown in Figure 3 as compared
with the prior art Figure 1. As stated in the paragraph bridging pages 3 and 4 of our
original opinion, Figure 1 does not teach at all the claimed chopping means operating in
accordance with the second clock signal, where the chopping means in turn causes the
printing control means to be responsive to that data generated by the chopping means
clause of claim 1. However, it is noted that we did state that the bulk of the subject
matter of independent claim 1 on appeal was shown in prior art Figure 1 including the

data transmitting means clause, substantially all of the printing control means clause

Application 08/250,770

except for the responsive language to the chopped data, and the print control means
generating the horizontal sink signal at the end of claim 1 on appeal.

In response to appellant's presentation for the first time in the request for
rehearing further information about what appellant's admit to being in the admitted prior
art Figure 1, as well as what the laser printing arts generally recognize, we have
reconsidered our original opinion but come to the same conclusion as to the
unpatentability of the subject matter of claim 1 within 35 U.S.C. § 103 based upon the
same applied prior art, appe||ant’s admitted prior art Figure 1, in view of Tomita and
Hayashi. In light of the new emphasis presented in the request as outlined earlier, the
importance of the Hayashi reference becomes paramount. Since the admitted prior art
Figure 1 utilizes a laser as a light source for the laser beam of the claim, the
corresponding teachings of Hayashi are more significant than ever. Figures 1A and 1B
of Hayashi correspond to a complete laser imaged electrophotographic printing system,
only part ofwhich is correspondingly shown in appellant's prior art Figure 1.

In contrast to the prior art approach associated with appe||ants’s prior art Figure
1 permitting the user to change the bias voltage of the generator 70, appellant's
disclosed invention in representative Figure 3 takes the approach of controlling the

amount of light illuminating the photosensitive drum by chopping the video data to

Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

adjust the density of the printed images by designating or selecting the data deﬁning
the amount of light exposed in accordance with software as set forth in the summary of
the invention at the middle of page 6 of the speciﬁcation as ﬁled. It is stated there that
the sharpness of the printed images may be easily adjusted without adjusting the bias
voltage of the developing unit. This is brought out in more detail in the discussion in the
paragraph bridging pages 13 and 14 of the specification as ﬁled.

In a corresponding manner, the discussion of pertinent portions of Hayashi
indicates a similar approach notwithstanding the focus of Hayashi's invention being to
make his image forming apparatus more responsive to environmental conditions such
as humidity. Even as revealed in the abstract of Hayashi's disclosure, the control
circuitry regulates the amount of light of the exposure apparatus, including operation in
accordance with the output of the humidity detector. This is consistent with the nonnal
operation of the circuitry associated with Hayashi's invention. The printing unit 20 in
Figure 1B operates upon taking the provided image signals from the reader 100 "after
pulse width modulation etc., for driving the laser e|ement." (column 4, lines 40-43). This
is detailed more in the discussion beginning at column 5 associated with Figure 2 and
the corresponding discussion of Figures 16 and 14-1 and 14-2 beginning at column 5,

line 31. At least the discussion at column 6 of Hayashi indicates that the amount light




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0344
Application 08/250,770

emission from a laser is a function of current supplied to the laser and the pulse
duration that is normally supplied to it anyway. At column 6, lines 27-34 it is stated:
Therefore, in order to obtain the same image density from a same

image signal with a varied amount of laser light emission, it becomes

necessary to regulate the pulse duration in response to the change in the

amount of light emission. This is achieved, in the present embodiment, by

employing a number of binary encoding circuits corresponding to the

number of switched levels of the laser power.

Figure 5 depicts a logical flow chart diagram indicating that the particular choice of laser
power to achieve the desired print density is a function of the CPU controlled clocking
signals (pulse duration or pulse width modulation) provided. Note also in contrast
Hayashi’s prior art statement at column 1, at least at lines 18-29.

In any event, the approach taken in Hayashi appears consistent with that taken
by appe||ant’s disclosed invention in Figure 3, the subject matter of the chopping means
of claim 1 on appeal, and appe||ant’s disclosed approach to control the amount of light
illuminating the photosensitive drum to adjust the density of the printed images.
Hayashi’s approach is comparable to the analogous solutions provided by Tomita for
light emitting diode exposure printing devices. Even though it is for a plurality of light
emitting diode printing elements set forth in an array, Tomita does teach selectability of

pulse signals based on different duty ratios according to the showing in Figure 6 relied

upon by the examiner. The variable duty ratio discussions and showings in Figures 6-9

Application 08/250,770

are comparable to the pulse width modulation teachings in Hayashi. By selective
application of the pulse signature generator circuit 6 in Figure 6, along with its pulse
signal selection circuitry 7, the chopping means or AND gate array 3 selectively chops
the pixel data presented in shift register 4 before activation by the LED element array 1.
Tomita effectively changes the power levels to the individual light emitting diode
elements in a corresponding manner that Hayashi does so with respect to a laser
emitting element.

To the extent the problems associated with appellant's admitted prior art exist as
disclosed, Hayashi's approach appears to teach the solution of these problems for a

similar, corresponding laser-based imaging device. In a corresponding, analogous

manner, Tomita takes a similar approach for light emitting diode-based printing devices.

In contrast to the appellant's admitted prior art approach in Figure 1 of the user
selecting print density by the use of a selector switch to control the bias voltage to the
developer associated with electrophotographic printing apparatus, both Hayashi and
Tomita take a correspondingly similar approach as to what appellant has done to
effectively control the amount of light illuminating photosensitive drum from the
respective illuminating element, a laser in appellant's admitted prior art Figure 1 and in

Hayashi and light emitting diodes in Tomita. In either case, the density of the printed

images is controlled by defining the amount of light exposed to the photosensitive drum
in both secondary references in the corresponding manner as appellant does. In this
light, it appears to us that the applied prior art still addresses the problem as well as the
solution provided by appellant.

To the extent appellant argues that the purposes of the references relied upon
by the examiner are different from the appellant's disclosed purpose, this is not
necessarily pertinent to the issue and is essentially irrelevant if the prior art teachings
would have led the artisan to construct an arrangement having the claimed structural
features. In re Heck, 699 F.2d 1331, 216 USPQ 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and In re Kronig,
539 F.2d 1300, 190 USPQ 425 (CCPA 1976). In re Heck also indicates that the use of

patents as references is not limited to what the patentees described as their own

invention. The law of obviousness does not require that references be combined for
reasons contemplated by an inventor, but only looks to whether the motivation or
suggestion to combine references is provided by prior art taken as a whole. ln_re
Biatti_e, 974 F.2d 1309, 24 USPQ2d 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In an obviousness
detennination, the prior art need not suggest solving the same problem set forth by
appellant. In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692-93, 16 USPQ2d 1897, 1901 (Fed. Cir.
1990)(en banc)(overru|ing in part In re Wright, 848 F.3d 1216, 1220, 6 USPQ2d 1959,

1962 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). cert. denied, 5oo u.s. 904 (1991).

that we have in fact reviewed our ﬁndings, but is denied as to making any change

therein.
