BACKGROUND

1. A review of the file record indicates that claims 57 to 65 have been rejected
under 35 U.S.C. § 251 as attempting to recapture subject matter surrendered in the
application to obtain the original patent.

2. A precedential opinion concerning a reissue recapture rejection under
35 U.S.C. § 251 was decided May 29, 2003 in Ex parte Eggert? In §gge_rt, the majority
opinion applied the fact-specific analysis set forth in In re Clement, 131 F.3d 1464,
1468-71 45 USPQ2d 1161, 1164-66 (Fed. Cir. 1997), determined that under the facts
and circumstances before it, the “surrendered subject matter" was claim 1 of Eggert as
that claim existed prior to the post-final rejection amendment that led to the allowance of
claim 1 in the original patent, and decided that reissue claims 15-22 of Eggert were n_ot
precluded (i.e., barred) by the “recapture ru|e." Slip. op. at 39-45.

ACTION

We remand this application to the examiner for a determination of whether the
rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 251 remains appropriate in view of Ex parte Eggert.

If the examiner determines that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 251 remains
appropriate, the examiner is authorized to prepare a supplemental examiner's answer

specifically addressing the § 251 rejection. See 37 CFR § 1.193(b)(1). In the event that

the examiner furnishes a supplemental answer, the appellant may file a reply brief in
accordance with 37 CFR § 1.193(b)(1).

If the examiner determines that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 251 is no longer
appropriate, the examiner should withdraw the rejection in an appropriate Office action.

CONCLUSION

This application, by virtue of its "special" status, requires immediate action, see
MPEP § 708.01.

If after action by the examiner in response to this remand there still remains
decision(s) of the examiner being appealed, the application should be promptly returned

to the Board of Patent Appeals and interferences.
