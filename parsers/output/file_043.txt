BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte MATTHEW M. HENRY

Appeal No. 1999-0681
Application No. 08/697,478

ON BRIEF

Before MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, COHEN and
STAAB, Administrative Patent Judges.

MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant has requested a rehearing from a new ground of rejection which we
introduced pursuant to 37 CFR § l.196(b) in our decision mailed January 31, 2001 (Paper
No. 22). In that decision, we reversed the examiner’s rejections of the appealed claims
and, pursuant to the provisions of 37 CFR § 1.196(b), rejected the appealed claims under
the ﬁrst paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112 as being based on a speciﬁcation which, as filed,

does not satisfy the description requirement in that paragraph. We have carefully

considered appellant’s request, but ﬁnd nothing to persuade us that our decision to reject
the appealed claims under the ﬁrst paragraph of § 112 was in error.

In support of our new rejection, we held that there was no descriptive support in
the original speciﬁcation, including the original claims, or the original drawings for the
recitation in claim 1 that the shoulder (18) is “formed on the inside of the conical [sic]
shaped wall,” for the recitation in claims 1, 5 and 14 that the shoulder is formed “at the
second end of the [conical shaped] wall,” and for the recitation in claim 14 that the
shoulder is “formed in the inside surface of the conical [sic] shaped wall” (see pages 8-9
of our decision). Instead, as noted on page 9 of our decision, Figure 2 of appellant’s
drawings shows that the shoulder is formed in an axially extending cylindrical end
portion adjoining a conically shaped wall portion.

Appellant does not challenge our finding that the shoulder is in the cylindrical
wall portion, rather than the adjoining conically shaped wall portion. Instead, appellant
contends that we erred in our rejection by referring to the claimed “conical shaped wall”
as a “conically shaped wall.” In particular, appellant contends that we erred by
interpreting the word “conical” too narrowly as meaning “conical throughout its entire
length” (request for rehearing, page 2).

In this regard, appellant contends on page 2 of his request for rehearing that “the
phase, [sic] ‘conical shaped wall’ must include the cylindrical portion . . .” On page 5 of
the request for rehearing, appellant fu.rtl1er contends that the term “conical” is “broadly
understood in the art to mean an interface between a pipe and a catalytic converter” with
the result that it may include shapes other than the dictionary meaning of the word

“conical.” As we understand appellant’s position, a “conical shaped wall” differs from a




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 1999-0681

Application No. 08/697,478

“comically shaped wall” in that it may include shapes other than comical shapes, namely a
cylindrical shape. We do mot agree with this interpretation. Moreover, it is not supported
by appellant’s speciﬁcation as ﬁled.

In our decision, we never intimated that the appealed claims literally recite a
“comically shaped wall.” We did, however, refer to the claimed “conical shaped wall” as
a “comically shaped wall” because the expression “conical shaped wall” is grammatically
imco1rect.1 In this regard, the word “conical” is an adjective amd therefore may only serve
to modify a noun or a pronoun. However, the word “shaped” is Q a noun or a pronoun,
but instead is the verb “shape” in the past tense. Therefore, the use of the adverb
“comically” is grammatically appropriate for modiﬁng the verb “shaped” in the past
temse.2 In short, the words “conical” amd “comically” are modiﬁers amd, in substance,
mean the same thing, the only difference being a grammatical ome.

Furthermore, we disagree with appellant’s comtemtiom om page 2 of the request for
rehearing that the dictionary deﬁnition for the word “comical” is broad enough to
encompass shapes other tham conical shapes. According to its dictiomary deﬁnition,3 the
word “comica ” is defined as resembling or having the shape of cone (which comports
with appellant’s proposed dictionary deﬁnition). By definition, therefore, “comica ”

excludes shapes (e.g., cylimdrical shapes) other than shapes resembling a come. In short, a

cylindrical shape does not resemble a cone and thus may not be construed as having a
conical shape.4

Furthermore, appellant has not introduced sufﬁcient evidence to establish that the
adjective “conical” or its adverbial counterpart “conically” has acquired a meaning in the
catalytic converter art to include cylindrical shapes or other non- conical shapes. With
regard to the cited Nara et al. Patent No. 4,279,864, the “[c]onverged ends 32a and 32b”
(column 1, line 21) are shown to be separate from the conical pipes 3a and 3b. Figure 3
of this patent does not relate to the prior art converter of Figure 1. Instead, Figure 3
illustrates a sealing member for the Nara et al. invention. Even if the term “conical” was
used in a misdescriptive sense in the Nara et al. patent to include “converged” (whatever
that may mean) ends or “diverged” ends, such misuse in a single patent does not establish
that “conical” is typically used in the catalytic converter art to include a cylindrical shape.
The Nara et al. patent is equivocal at best.

We are not unmindful of appellant’s reliance on In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048,
1054-55, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027 (Fed Cir. 1997). However, this case supports our
position, not appellant’s position.

In Mojn'is, 127 F.3d at 1056, 44 USPQ2d at 1029 the court observed that, with
regard to the claim language in issue, the appellant failed to make his intended meaning
“explicitly clear” (emphasis added). The i court went on to hold that interpreting
the claim language in light of the Morris patent speciﬁcation was of no avail to the

appellant because the speciﬁcation failed to set forth the deﬁnition now sought by the

4 In this context the word “shape” is used as a noun. It therefore is grammatically correct
to use the modiﬁer “conical.”

appellant. L1. The same is true in the case at bar. Appellant’s speciﬁcation does not
make it clear that the expression “conical shaped wall” may include a cylindrical shape or
other non-conical shapes.

Accordingly, the expression “conical shaped wall” must be given its ordinary and
accustomed meaning. E Lantech, Inc. v. Keip Machine Company, 32 F. 3d 542, 547,

31 USPQ2d 1666, 1670 (Fed. Cir. 1994). See also Cortland Line Co. v. Orvis Co. 203

 

F.3d 1351, 1356, 53 USPQ2d 1734, 1737 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (“Claim terms receive their
ordinary and customary meaning unless the patentee assigns a special meaning”). The
ordinary and accustomed dictionary meaning of “conical” in the expression “conical
shaped wall” excludes cylindrical and other non-conical shapes. Therefore, the original
speciﬁcation as ﬁled lacks descriptive support for the claim limitations discussed in our
§ 112, ﬁrst paragraph, rejection of the appealed claims as set forth in our decision dated
January 31, 2001.
In light of the foregoing, appellant’s request for rehearing is granted to the extent

of reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to making any change thereto.
