Appeal No. 1999-1095

ON BRIEF

 

Before SCHAFER, LEE and MEDLEY, Administrative Eatent Judges.
LEE, 

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

On May 14, 2001, we issued a decision affirming the
examiner's rejection of appellants’ claims 13, 15 and 17-20.
(Paper No. 16). On June 14, 2001, the appellants filed a

request for rehearing. For reasons explained below, the

request is DENIED.

In the first paragraph on page 2, the appellants state

that “required findings are absent from the Board's decision.”

Application ior patent filed November 18, 1996.

However, nowhere does the appellants point out what findings
we allegedly failed to make. Evidently, the appellants simply
disagree with the findings we did make. In the full paragraph
on the middle of page 5 of the decision, and in response to
the appellants’ argument in the appeal brief that Ennis ‘429
does not teach use of a coloring agent in the sense of the
appellants’ invention because the coloring pigment of Ennis
‘429 has no color that is described, we specifically found
that Ennis ‘429 discloses use of a coloring agent as has been
claimed:

Ennis ‘429 generally refers to the addition of a

coloring pigment without particularly specifying the

color. That would have indicated to one with

ordinary skill in the art that the particular

coloring is not important, and that whatever color

is used would be fine so long as the light

transmissivity of the coloring pigment is between

that of water and oil. None of this makes Ennis

‘429's coloring pigment not a coloring agent. That

the coloring pigment in Ennis ‘429 is used for

changing light transmissivity and not so much for

providing a color does not disqualify it from being
a coloring agent. (Emphasis added.)

In the request for rehearing, the appellants re—present
the same argument which we have rejected, only in different
words:

As mentioned previously, the critical test for a §
103 rejection is whether Ennis ‘429 teaches or

2

Appeal No. 1999-1095
Application O8/751,632

suggests to one skilled in the art the use of a

coloring agent for the present invention. Applicant

respectfully assert that no suggestion is made

within Ennis ‘429 that the use of coloring agents is

obvious for techniques that don't require coloring

agents in order to function, but rather merely to

help to improve the technique. (Emphasis in

original).
The argument is also not commensurate in scope with what the
appellants have claimed. The claims on appeal do not limit
the purpose or need for which a coloring agent is used or the
degree of such purpose or need. For instance, independent
claim 13 recites merely the following with respect to a
coloring agent: “displacing and replacing the wellbore fluid
in said selected interval of a borehole with a transparent
water mixture having a viscosifying gent, a coloring agent,
and optionally sufficient salt to increase the mixture
density.”

The request for rehearing is also not an opportunity for

a dissatisfied appellants to introduce new arguments for the

first time, i.e., arguments not presented in the appeal brief.

Accordingly, all of the arguments contained in the rehearing
request concerning unexpected results are improper and not
entitled to consideration. In any event, the appellants have

not submitted objective evidence in the form of declarations

in connection with the belated argument of unexpected results.

Finally, the appellants take exception to a statement
which they assert the examiner made but which the examiner did
not make. In that regard, on page 4 of the request for
rehearing it is stated:

Applicant also assert that the Examiner's
unsubstantiated statement that viscosifying agents
are solely intended to prevent charge material from
being driven into the underground formation (see
Board decision, p. 8) overlooks the nonobvious
results produced by this invention. (Emphasis
addedJ

Our initial decision on page 8 did not indicate any examiner
statement which regard viscosifying agents as “solely”
intended to prevent charge material from being driven into the
underground formation. What was stated in our decision is
this:

With regard to Ennis ‘889, the examiner's answer
states that the disclosed functionality of a
viscosifying agent to prevent a charging material
from being driven into the underground formation is
equally applicable to the combination of Riordan and
Ennis ‘429. The finding is facially plausible.
Furthermore, in the examiner's answer, on page 5, it
is stated that “the use of such ‘viscosifying
agents’ is notoriously well known in the wellbore
exploration art for this very purpose.” The
appellants have not filed any reply to the
examiner's answer. Thus, the statement of the
examiner as to what is notoriously well known in the
art stands unrebutted.

In any event, it is too late to be challenging, in a request
for rehearing, findings made by the examiner in the examiner's
answer, where no reply was filed to rebut the finding. An
adverse decision is not an invitation for new arguments.
Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the request for rehearing is
DENIED.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

§ l.l36(b).
