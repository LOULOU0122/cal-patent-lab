AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte PAUL D. CASE

Appeal No. 97-0292
Application O7/814,779

HEARD: December 11, 1997

Before COHEN, MEISTER and CRAWFORD, Aministrative Patent
Judges.

MEISTER, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
The appellants request we reconsider our decision mailed
on December 31, 1997, wherein we affirmed the examiner's

rejections of (1) claims 1, 4-6, 8, 12-23, 26 and 29—31 as

1 Application for patent filed December 30, 1991. According to
appellants, this application is a continuation of Application 07/541,861,
filed June 21, 1990, now abandoned.

being unpatent—able over Cline in view of Hampl and (2) Claims
9-11 as being unpatentable over Cline in view of Hampl and
Montoya. We have carefully reconsidered our decision in light
of the arguments advanced; however, we decline to alter our
decision in any respect.
The appellants note that on page 6 of our decision we

quoted column 2, lines 39-43, of Cline wherein it is stated
that:

The magnesium oxide may be used as the sole filler

for the paper or it may be used in combination with

the other conventional fillers such as calcium

carbonate provided at least l5% by weight of the

wrapper is magnesium oxide. [Emphasis added.]
The appellants on page 3 of the request thereafter state that
(l) “[t]his one statement in Cline, taken independently from
the remainder of the reference, may appear to the Board to

teach what the Board alleges” and (2) “if the Board actually
had considered the reference as a whole, they would have noted
in the paragraph directly after this statement . . . that
Cline contradicts the Board's interpretation.” In support of
this position the appellants reference column 2, line 65,

through column 3, line 20, of Cline wherein it is stated:

Appeal No. 97-0292
Application O7/814,779

Neither magnesium oxide nor the chemical

adjuvant salts when used alone as a filler or

coating in smoking article wrappers substantially

reduce visible sidestream smoke. . . . The amounts

of magnesium oxide and chemical adjuvant employed in

the wrapper are critical and it has been found that

amounts of magnesium oxide less than l5% and of

chemical adjuvant salt of less than 0.5% by weight

are ineffective in combination to achieve the

desired reduction in visible sidestream smoke.

Preferably and for maximum sidestream smoke

reductions, the wrapper should contain at least 35%

magnesium oxide and at least 2.0% of the chemical

adjuvant salt.

We must point out, however, the fact that Cline subse-
quently states that (l) magnesium oxide when used alone does
not “substantially reduce” visible sidestream smoke and (2)
“preferably” the wrapper should contain at least 35% magnesium
oxide, does not “contradict” what has previously been stated
in lines 39-43 of column 2 as the appellants allege. While,
of course, that portion of Cline noted by the appellants
indicates that magnesium oxide when used alone is ineffective
or unsatisfactory and that the “preferred” embodiment is one
which contains at least 35% magnesium oxide, all of the
teachings of a particular reference must be evaluated for what

they fairly teach one of ordinary skill in the art, including

those teachings that are “phrased in terms of a nonjpreferred

embodiment or as being unsatisfactory for the intended
purpose” (emphasis ours). In re Boe, 355 F.2d 961, 965, 148

USPQ 507, 510 (CCPA 1966). We also observe that what Cline
considers “ineffective” vis—a—vis what the appellants consider
“ineffective” is not clear.

Moreover, we did not simply rely on lines 39-43 of column
2 of Cline as the appellants imply. In our decision we also
made note of the fact that in Cline:

the first line of the Abstract and column 2, lines
17-27, state that the invention is for a wrapper
having “at least 15% by weight magnesium oxide in
combination with at least 0.5% by weight of a
specific chemical adjuvant," without making any
mention whatsoever of “other convention fillers”
being used. Equally significant is the fact that in
independent claim 1 Cline sets forth that the
wrapper contains “at least 15% magnesium oxide and
at least 0.5% of a chemical adjuvant salt,” without
setting forth that the wrapper contains “other
conventional fillers.” [Page 6.]

The appellants also urge that they are the “ones” skilled
in the art and imply that, as such, their interpretation of
Cline should be dispositive. However, as the court stated in
In re Vamco Mach. & Tool, Inc., 752 F.2d 1564, 1575, 24 USPQ2d
617, 623 (Fed. Cir. 1985): “We too can read this patent and

understand what it describes.”

The appellants also note that “there is no clear teaching
in the examples of Cline utilizing l5% sole total filler or

anything remotely close” (request, page 3) and contend that

the “examples in Cline, however, have been wholly overlooked
by the Board" (request, page 4). While it is true that there
is no specific example in Cline of utilizing l5% sole total

filler, a reference

must be evaluated for all it teaches and is not limited to its

specific examples. In re Snow, 471 F.2d l400, l403, l76 USPQ

328, 329 (CCPA 1973).

The appellants’ request is granted to the extent of
reconsidering our decision, but is denied with respect to
making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

§ l.l36(a).

DENIED
