Appeal No. 2005-0243
Application No. 10/106,951

ON BRIEF

Before HAIRSTON, KRASS, and NAPPI, Administrative Patent Judges.

HAIRSTON, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

In a decision dated January 14, 2005, the decision of the
examiner rejecting claims 1 through 4, 6, 7, l2, 15 through
18 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § l02(b) was affirmed, and the decision
of the examiner rejecting claims 20 through 22 under 35 U.S.C.
§ l03(a) was affirmed.

Appellants now argue (request, page 3) that:

The Decision dated 14 January 2005 fails to cite

anything in Moore which discloses that the
pipe/substrate (and not merely a side thereof) is

“position[ed] . . . within a substantially hermetically
sealed environment." Indeed, the Decision fails to
even mention this feature, instead treating claim 2 as
if it were one and the same as claim 1 . . . .

If the pipe is the substrate, at most according to
the reasoning of the Decision a side of the
pipe/substrate may be “position[ed] . . . within a
substantially hermetically sealed environment." But of
course, that is not what claim 2 recites. Applicants
respectfully submit that is [sic] it is very clear from

Moore that the substrate/pipe itself is never
“position[ed] . . . within a substantially hermetically

sealed environment." And so, the arrangement of Moore

cannot possibly anticipate the method of claim 2.

We agree with appellants’ arguments. The anticipation
rejection of claim 2 is reversed because Moore is incapable of
“positioning a substrate within a hermetically sealed
environment."

Turning to claim 15, appellants argue (request, pages 3 and
4) that Moore does not disclose the apparatus features recited in
this claim. The claimed “first chamber” makes this claim more
specific than claim 1. Thus, the anticipation rejection of claim
15 is reversed because Moore does not have such a chamber in
which “a substantially inert atmosphere can be generated." The
anticipation rejection of claims 16 through 18 is reversed
because they depend from claim 15.

Turning next to claims 1 and 23, appellants argue (request,

page 5) that Moore does not disclose measuring any permeation

rate of any substrate/encapsulation. We disagree. As stated in
our decision (pages 4 and 5), the permeation rate is measured by
observing the change in color of the reactive material. In other
words, the change in the color of the reactive material reflects
the amount of fugitive gas that the reactive material has been
exposed to after the fugitive gas has passed through or permeated
the wall of the substrate. Thus, we decline the appellants’
request to change the affirmance of claims 1 and 23, and claims
3, 4, 6, 7 and 12 which depend from claim 1.

The obviousness rejection of claims 20 through 22 is
reversed because Jung does not cure the noted shortcoming in the
teachings of Moore.

In summary, appellants’ request has been granted to the
extent that we have reversed the anticipation rejection of claims
2 and 15 through 18, and reversed the obviousness rejection of

claims 20 through 22.
