REQUEST FOR REHEARING

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

Appellant requests rehearing and reconsideration of our
decision of June 30, 2000 wherein we affirmed the examiner's

decision rejecting claims 1, ll, 12, 16-18 and 25 under 35

U.S.C. 102(b) and rejecting claims 1, 9, 16 and 25 under 35
U.S.C. 103.

In particular, appellant takes issue with our
interpretation of the claimed shield being “readily
deformable." Appellant contends that while they agree that
all materials are “deformable” to a degree, this does not mean
that all materials, such as that in the reference to Kirschner

are “readily deformable,"

as claimed. Appellant points to
instant Figure 3 for an illustration of what is intended by
“readily deformable." Figure 3 shows a shield being pushed in
by a falling coffee mug. Appellant's position is that
“readily deformable” is clearly defined in claim 1 in stating
that the purpose of the shield being “readily deformable” is
to protect the display screen on which it is mounted.

We disagree. We find nothing in claim 1 which would
distinguish the shield being “readily deformable” from that
which is disclosed by Kirschner. While the primary purpose of
the shield in Kirschner is to reduce the amount of ambient
light impinging on the screen, the shield also clearly
protects the screen. Moreover, since the material of the

shield in Kirschner does deform to some degree and deforms

“immediately” upon impact by an object, we hold that

” as claimed and as

Kirschner’s shield is “readily deformable,
defined by appellant. The shields of Kirschner and appellant
may differ by the amount, or degree, of deformation, but we
find no language in the instant claims which would distinguish
over that disclosed by Kirschner.

At the bottom of page 2 of the Request for Rehearing,
appellant states that “Kirschner can only logically be applied
to the skins of Kirschner’s “rigid” composite. Applicant's
claim l sets forth that the top and sides of the shield can be
readily deformed, not just the skins thereof.”

Appellant's argument is not well taken. If, by “skins,”
appellant refers to the flexible vinyl cover sheets overlying
the laminated chipboard of Kirschner’s shield, the top and
sides of Kirschner’s shield are both covered by the vinyl
sheets. Therefore, if one accepts that the vinyl coverings,
or “skins,” of Kirschner’s shield are “readily deformable,”
then clearly the top and sides of Kirschner’s shield are, or
can be, readily deformed, as required by claim l. But, we
note again, that in addition to the vinyl covering of

Kirschner being “readily deformable,” the laminated chipboard

which is covered by the vinyl sheets is also “readily
deformable," to a degree, when impacted by a foreign object.
Thus, the language of instant claim 1 would appear to be
anticipated by Kirschner under alternative interpretations.

At page 3 of the Request for Rehearing, appellant
contends that our decision is “deficient” because while claims
1, 9, l6 and 25 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103, only claim 9
is discussed in the opinion. We addressed only claim 9
because appellant argued the merits of no other claim with
regard to the rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103. If appellant had
arguments with regard to the substance of any other claim,
those arguments should have been presented. Arguments not
made are waived. In re Kroekel, 803 F.2d 705, 231 USPQ 640
(Fed. Cir. 1986). Even in the Request for Rehearing,
appellant offer no arguments as to why the examiner's
rejection of these claims under 35 U.S.C. 103 is in error.

In arguing claim 9 in the Request for Rehearing (pages 3-
4), appellant contends that the Giulie reference does not
disclose the claimed structure wherein the side walls are
releasably cojoined by means of interfitting tabs and slots.

We disagree. Figure 2 of Giulie and the section depicted in

_4_




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-1748
Application No. 08/758,295

Figure 3 clearly show that the sides and top of Giulie’s glare
shield are releasably interconnected by “interfitting tabs and
slots" (for example, horizontal portion 29 is a “tab” and gaps
27 and 28 form a “slot"). While Giulie’s joined portions may
differ from the “interfitting tabs and slots" shown in
appellant's drawing wherein the portions are meshed together,
Giulie clearly discloses a glare shield which has a top wall
and two side walls and wherein the side walls are “releasably
joined to said top wall by means of interfitting tabs and
slots," as broadly claimed. Giulie’s portions are
“interfitting” because the tabs of the side portions fit into
the slots of the top portion.

Appellant's Request for Rehearing has been granted to the
extent that we have reconsidered our decision but the request

is denied with respect to making any changes in our decision.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in
connection with this appeal may be extended under

37 CFR § l.l36(a).

DENIED
