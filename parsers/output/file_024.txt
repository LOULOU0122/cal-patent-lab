Appeal No. 97-2967
Application 07/908,967

U.S.C. § 103 over Gerszewski in View of Hutton was sustained.

We have carefully considered appellant’s arguments in the request, however, we are not
persuaded that our decision was in error in any respect.

Appellant argues that because Hutton describes an anchor and Gerszewski describes a footing,
the devices of Hutton and Gerszewski are related to non—ana1ogous art. Appellant also argues that
there is no suggestion to combine the teachings of these references. The argument directed to non-
analogous art is not properly before us because it was not previously advanced in appellant’s brief or
reply brief for the examiner’s consideration and is not rebuttal to anything set forth in our decision. E
Ex parte Hindersinn, 177 USPQ 78 (Bd App. 1971). In regard to the suggestion to combine
Gerszewski and Hutton appellant is directed to pages 7 and 8 of our decision. We only add that while
appellant is correct that a footing is a load bearing device which transfers load to the earth, a footing
also anchors a building to the ground and therefore movement of the footing in any direction would act
to destabilize the building. As such, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to
form a footing as taught by Hutton to make the footing more resistant to upward movement.

In regard to the asserted long felt need of the claimed footing, appellant argues that the need to

prevent movement of a footing is so well recognized that it should not need further proof.

Appeal No. 97-2967
Application 07/908,967

In support of this proposition, appellant has ﬁled a copy of several pages from the text Structural
Engineering Handbook, (Gaylord, Jr. et al., Fourth Edition, McGraw—Hill, 1997) as Exhibit 1 to the
request. We will not consider the Structural Engineering Handbook because it was not accompanied
by a showing of good and sufﬁcient reasons why it was not earlier presented. 37 CFR § 1.195. In
regard to appellant’s argument that no proof is needed to establish long felt need, we refer to page 8 of
our decision.

In light of the foregoing, appellant’s request is granted to the extent of reconsidering our
decision, but is denied with respect to making any changes thereof.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be

extended under 37 CFR 1.136(a).
