ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants have ﬁled a paper under 37 CFR § 1.197(b) requesting that we
reconsider our decision of May 31, 2001, wherein we affirmed the rejection of

claims 1, 3-10 and 12-22 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

Appeal No. 1996-1132
Application 08/217,752

37 CFR § l.l97(b) provides as follows:

Appellant may ﬁle a single request for rehearing within two months
from the date of the original decision, unless the original decision is so
modiﬁed by the decision on rehearing as to become, in effect, a new
decision, and the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences so states.
The request for rehearing must state with particularity the points
believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the
decision and also state all other grounds upon which rehearing is
sought. See § l.l36(b) for extensions of time for seeking rehearing in
a patent application and § l.550(c) for extensions of time for seeking
rehearing in a reexamination proceeding.

Appellants assert that the Board has overlooked and/or misconstrued
limitations appearing in claim 1. Specifically Appellants state:
[C]laim 1 according to the present invention requires, inter alia:

(iii) withdrawing azine final product thus formed from
said circulating reaction medium to maintain the volume
thereof essentially constant,

(iv) heating said circulating reaction medium to a
temperature of at least 130°C...

Thus, as set forth above, the process of the presently claimed
invention requires the step of withdrawing azine final product from the
reaction medium (step iii) an_<l heating said circulating medium (which
does not include the azine reaction product, which was removed in
step (iii)) to a temperature of at least 130°C (step (iv)). Appellants
respectfully submit that neither the grounds for rejection nor the
Decision rendered May 31, 2001 fully account for these requirements.
[Rehearing Request, p. 2]

We cannot agree. Claim 1 does not require that step (iii) occur before and
separate from step (iv) as the Appellants seem to think. In re Morris, 127 F.3d
1048, 1056, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“It is the applicants’ burden
to precisely define the invention, not the PTO’s.”). Appealed claim 1 does not
require the azine product to be removed from the circulating reaction medium prior
to heating to a temperature of at least 130°C. Claim 1 also does not require the
circulating reaction medium to be devoid of azine when heated to a temperature of
at least 130°C. According to the specification, page 9, the azine can be removed by
a distillation process. The speciﬁcation, page 10, also discloses distillation is
suitable for removing water from the circulating reaction medium. Unless the steps
of a method actually recite an order, the steps are not ordinarily construed to require
a particular order. Interactive Giﬂ Express, Inc. v. Campuserve, Inc., 256 F .3d
1323, 1342, 59 USPQ2d 1401, 1416 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding no order required).
The present record does not indicate that azine is not be removed while the heating
circulating reaction medium.

In summary, we have reconsidered our decision in light of all of the

arguments made in the appellants’ request. However, we see no compelling reason

justifying a different result. Accordingly, we decline to modify our original
decision.
Time for taking action

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this

appeal may be extended under 37 CFR § l.l36(a).
