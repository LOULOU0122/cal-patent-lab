Paper No. 33

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte DAVID D. MURESAN
and DAVID MURESAN

Appeal No. 2001-2305
Application 08/669,674

ON BRIEF
Before COHEN, MCQUADE, and CRAWFORD, Administrative Patent

Judges.

MCQUADE, Administrative Patent Judge.

REMAND TO THE EXAMINER

The instant application has been forwarded to this Board by
the examiner for a decision on appeal. Because the record before
us raises a serious question as to whether we have jurisdiction
to hear an appeal at this point, we remand the application to the
examiner under the authority of 37 CFR § l.l96(a) and MPEP § 1211
for resolution of this and other matters.

The record shows the following with regard to our areas of

COHCEIH .

Appeal No. 2001-2305
Application 08/669,674

I. On August 31, 1999, this Board rendered a decision (Paper
No. 16) in an earlier appeal (Appeal No. 99-0103) involving the
application. The decision sustained the examiner's 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) rejection of claim 1, the sole claim pending in the
application, as being unpatentable over U.S. Patent No. 4,760,510
to Lahti.

II. In response to the decision, the appellants ultimately
filed a request for a continued prosecution application (Paper
No. 23). The request did not include any amendment of the
application.

III. In an Office action dated August 15, 2000 (Paper No.
25), the examiner found the request for a continued prosecution
application to be acceptable, rejected claim 1 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 112, second paragraph, as being indefinite and under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103(a) as being unpatentable over Lahti, and made the Office
action final.1

IV. After filing what amounted to a request for
reconsideration (Paper No. 26) which the examiner viewed to be

unpersuasive (see Paper No. 27), the appellants submitted an

1 Given the inclusion of the new 35 U.S.C. § 112, second
paragraph, rejection, the finality of the Office action clearly
was premature. See MPEP §§ 706.07(a) and 706.07(b).

appeal brief (Paper No. 28) on November 13, 2000. Upon being
notified by the examiner that the brief was not acceptable
because the statutory fee for filing the brief had not been
submitted (see Paper No. 29), the appellants submitted the
requisite fee on December 5, 2000 (see Paper No. 30). The record
does not show that the appellants filed a petition and fee for an
extension of time to accommodate the delay in paying the appeal
brief fee.

V. On February 13, 2001, the examiner issued an examiner's
answer (Paper No. 31) in response to the appellants’ brief.

VI. On March 23, 2001, the appellants submitted a letter
(Paper No. 32) which the examiner characterized as a reply brief
and noted (see Paper No. 33) before forwarding the application to
this Board.

The record does not indicate that the appellants ever filed,
in connection with the current appeal proceedings, a notice of
appeal pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.191(a) or the corresponding
statutory fee required by 35 U.s.C. § 41(a)(6)(A). This apparent
lapse arguably renders the application abandoned, which of course
would deprive us of any jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The
examiner is directed to take appropriate action to resolve this

matter in accordance with the relevant statutes and regulations.

Appeal No. 2001-2305
Application 08/669,674

Our review also shows (1) that the explanations of the 35
U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, rejection in the final rejection
(Paper No. 25) and examiner's answer (Paper No. 31) do not
address with any reasonable specificity the limitations recited
in the claim, and (2) that the appellants’ briefs, perhaps
understandably, do not contain any reasonably specific argument
of this rejection. As a result, the issues pertaining to the
rejection have not been developed to the extent necessary for a
reasoned consideration on appeal. In the event the appeal is
eventually perfected from a procedural standpoint, the examiner
is further directed to take appropriate action to rectify this
deficiency.

Additionally, the nature of the examiner's remarks in the
answer explaining the 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, and 35
U.S.C. § 103(a) rejections and the copy of the “claim involved in
[the] appeal” in the appendix section of the appellants’ brief
causes us to question whether the examiner and/or the appellants
are focusing on the version of claim 1 officially entered into
the record, i.e., claim 1 as submitted on December 22, 1997 in

Paper No. 5.2 The examiner is directed to take appropriate

2 Contrary to the assertion on page 3 thereof, the
examiner's answer does not include an appendix showing “claim 1
correctly written.”

action to ensure that the officially entered version of the claim
is addressed in any further proceedings on appeal.

Finally, given their pgg sg status and obvious unfamiliarity
with patent prosecution practice, the appellants may wish to
consider contacting the USPTO’s Office of Independent Inventor
Programs at (703) 306-5568 for answers to procedural questions
relating to the prosecution of their application.
