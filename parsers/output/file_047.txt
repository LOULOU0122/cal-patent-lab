Paper No. 34

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte RONALD M. RENDLEMEN, HOWARD W. DeMOORE and JOHN W. BIRD

Appeal No. 1999-1348
Application No. 08/435,798

HEARD: May 9, 2001

Before MCCANDLISH, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, NASE1 and
BAHR, Administrative Patent Judges.

BAHR, Administrative Patent Judge.

ECI O HE G
This is a decision on appellants’ request for rehearing
under 37 CFR § 1.197 of the Board's decision mailed June 15,

2001 sustaining the examiner's rejections of claims 1-3, 5, 7,

1 Calvert, Administrative Patent Judge, retired before this case was
reached for rehearing. Legal support for substituting one Board member for
another can be found in In re Bose §g;p., 772 F.2d 866, 869, 227 USPQ l, 4
(Fed. Cir. 1985).

8, 10-16, 22 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 and reversing the
rejections of claims 4, 17 and 20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103, claim
17 under 35 U.S.C. § 102 and claims 3, 22 and 23 under 35
U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph. Appellants seek rehearing only
of our affirmance of the examiner's decision to reject claims
3 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

Appellants’ request (page 1) contends that the Board
wrongly characterized the rollers of Rhorer and Goettsch as
resilient anilox rollers in the earlier decision. However,
appellants have failed to clearly articulate a definition of
resilient anilox roller or “anilox roller having a resilient
transfer surface” (the language used in claims 3 and 23) which
distinguishes over the Rhorer and Goettsch rollers. The only
structural feature of an “anilox” roller set forth in
appellants’ specification is that “[t]he surface of an anilox
roller is engraved with an array of closely spaced, shallow
depressions referred to as ‘cells’” (page 12). From this, the
Board interpreted an “anilox roller” as “an applicator roller
having a surface engraved with an array of closely spaced,
shallow depressions" (decision, page 4). For the reasons set

forth on page 15 of the earlier decision, it is our view that

Appeal No. l999—l348
Application No. 08/435,798

the rollers disclosed by Rhorer and Goettsch are anilox
rollers having a resilient transfer surface in accordance with
this interpretation.

To the extent that appellants are attempting to define
“anilox roller" on page 2 of the request, this attempt is
unavailing. First, appellants provide neither a precise nor a
consistent definition of “anilox roller.” On page 2, in lines
7-8 of the request, appellants state that “[a]nilox rollers
are well known as a term of art in the printing industry for
metering rollers having the entire surface covered uniformly
with fine ink holding cells." In that the rollers of Rhorer
and Goettsch are covered uniformly with fine ink holding
cells, they would appear to meet such a definition. On page
2, in lines l4—l6 of the request, appellants urge that
“Exhibits A, B and C taken from a commercial web site
(pamarcotech.com) evidence generic use of the term ‘anilox’ to
describe uniformly patterned steel or ceramic metering
rollers.” While there is an Exhibit C attached to appellants’
request, Exhibits A and B are not attached. In any event,
appellants had the opportunity to present evidence as to the

definition of “anilox roller" prior to the Board's earlier

3

Appeal No. 1999-1348
Application No. 08/435,798

decision and elected not to do so.2 Accordingly, we decline
to consider such evidence upon rehearing, especially where the
evidence, as in the case of Exhibit C, does not expressly
define the term at issue.3
Moreover, even if we were to combine the two statements

on page 2 of appellants’ request mentioned supra, and give
“anilox roller" a narrow definition consistent with both of
these statements, namely, a uniformly patterned steel or
ceramic metering roller having the entire surface covered
uniformly with fine ink holding cells, we must not lose sight
of the fact that the terminology used in appellants’ claims 3
and 23 is “anilox roller having a resilient transfer surface.”
Stated differently, according to appellants, the roller
recited in the claims clearly differs from a conventional
prior art anilox roller in that the recited roller has a

resilient transfer surface. As the Rhorer and Goettsch

2 37 CFR § 1.195 provides that “[a]affidavits, declarations, or exhibits
submitted after the case has been appealed will not be admitted without a
showing of good and sufficient reasons why they were not earlier presented."

3 At best, Exhibit C evidences that at least one anilox roller on the
market includes a laser engraved ceramic outer coating over an aluminum layer.
This product description is ineffective to establish that all anilox rollers
have these features.




*** PAGE 5 ***

Application No. 08/435,798

rollers have resilient transfer surfaces, rather than hard
steel or ceramic surfaces on which the cell pattern is fixed,
they appear to respond structurally to the claim limitations.

The only argument offered in appellants’ request as to
why the Rhorer and Goettsch rollers are not resilient anilox
rollers is that they are “rubber printing rollers" (request,
page 1). From our perspective, the distinction argued by
appellants is directed to the intended use of the roller, not
to the actual structure of the roller, and thus cannot be
relied upon for patentability. It is well settled that the
recitation of an intended use for an old product does not make
a claim to that old product patentable. In re Schreiber, 128
F.3d 1473, 1477, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

As a final observation with regard to whether or not the
Rhorer and Goettsch rollers are an “anilox roller having
resilient transfer surfaces" as claimed by appellants, we note
that, in response to the examiner's enablement rejection,
appellants (brief, page 7) pointed to the examiner's citation
of the Rhorer and Goettsch references as prior art disclosing
such a roller to support the conclusion that one of ordinary

skill in the art would be aware of such a roller (i.e., an




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 1999-1348
Application No. 08/435,798

anilox roller having a resilient transfer surface). This
statement implies a concession by appellants that the Rhorer
and Goettsch rollers are anilox rollers having a resilient
transfer surface.

Appellants also add a new argument that, in essence,
there is no suggestion or teaching or reason to modify Bird as
proposed by the examiner because, if a skilled artisan were to
use a roller of the type disclosed by Rhorer or Goettsch in
Bird, such an artisan would replace the plate cylinder 19b and
relief plate 20b, not the applicator roller 33, with such a
roller (request, page 3). This argument was not presented by
appellants in either their brief or reply brief. In fact,
with regard to the examiner's obviousness rejection of claims
3 and 23, and the substitution of the roller of either Rhorer
or Goettsch for the applicator roller 33 of Bird in
particular, appellants’ sole argument was a glib statement
that the examiner's position was inconsistent with the
rejection of claims 3 and 23 under the first paragraph of 35
U.S.C. § 112 (brief, page 10). Appellants’ attempt to
belatedly present such a new argument is unavailing, since a

new argument advanced in a request for rehearing, but not

6




*** PAGE 7 ***

advanced in appellants’ brief, is not properly before the
Board and will not be considered.4

As should be evident from our discussion above,
appellants’ request for rehearing has been reviewed and the
request granted to the extent of our reconsidering our earlier
decision in light thereof, but is denied with respect to
making any changes in that decision.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in

connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

§ l.l36(a).
