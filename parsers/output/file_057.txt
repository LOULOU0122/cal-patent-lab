UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte CHRISTIAN STRAHM
and
THOMAS GERBIG

Appeal No. 2000-1060
Application No. 09/030,378

ON BRIEF
Before OWENS, KRATZ, and PAWLIKOWSKI, Administrative Patent
Judges.

OWENS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

The appellants request reconsideration of our October 19,
2001 decision wherein we affirmed the rejection of claims 6-8
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over the admitted prior art in view of
Aindow.

It remains undisputed that it would have been obvious to one
of ordinary skill in the art to apply Aindow’s powder removal air

jet (col. 7, lines 35-39) to the admitted prior art paste—point

coating and scattering device (specification, page 1). The

appellants argue in their request for rehearing that if one did

so, that person would

use only a small air jet angle as shown in Aindow’s figure 5
(item 152), and would not use an angle of 30—80° as recited in
the appellants’ claim 6.

Specifically, the appellants argue that the fact that
Aindow’s rollers are round rather than elliptical indicates that
Aindow’s drawings are at least roughly proportional, horizontal-
to—vertical (request, page 3).1 Round circles, however, are what
are drawn using a draftsman’s compass or template. The fact that
the circles are round does not mean that the components of the
apparatus, the distances between components, or the angle of the
air jet with respect to the web surface, are drawn to scale.
Aindow does not disclose the air jet angle in the specification,
and “[a]bsent any written description in the specification of
quantitative values, arguments based on measurement of a drawing
are of little value.” In re Wright, 569 F.2d 1124, 1127, 193

USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977). In Wright, wherein a reference did

not disclose that the drawings are to scale, the court rejected

the solicitor’s argument that the reference pointed to a distance

1 The appellants also argue generally that most drawings
are at least roughly proportional, horizontal—to—vertical
(reply, page 3), but provide no support for this argument.

from a groove to the rim of a whiskey barrel of about % inch to

1 inch. See id.
Also relevant are In re Nash, 230 F.2d 428, 109 USPQ 36

(CCPA 1956) and In re Olsen, 212, F.2d 590, 101 USPQ 402-03 (CCPA
1954). In Nash, 230 F.2d at 430-31, 109 USPQ at 37-38, the

specification described one of two openings in a load supporting
pneumatic cushioning device as being in free open communication
with a reservoir, and the other opening as being a restriction,
but the drawing showed the two openings as having substantially
the same diameter. The court stated that “[w]hile the
appellant's drawing, as above noted, seems to show the passages
as being of about the same size, it is well settled that the
drawings of patent applications are not necessarily scale or
working drawings, and that a clear disclosure of parts or
proportions in the specification is not nullified by a
draftsman’s error indicating different proportions or

arrangements.” Nash, 230 F.2d at 431, 109 USPQ at 38. In Olsen,

212 F.2d 590, 592-93, 101 USPQ 401, 402-03 (CCPA 1954), the court
stated that “[o]rdinarily drawings which accompany an application

for a patent are merely illustrative of the principles embodied

in the alleged invention claimed therein and do not define the
precise proportions of elements relied upon to endow the claims
with patentability," and held that the drawings did not

adequately support an amendment to the specification which

recited

that ball stop head portions of a coupler for releasably
connecting hydraulic fluid conduits are equally spaced with
respect to their associated valve seats.

Thus, Wright, Nash and Olsen all indicate that unless patent

drawings are disclosed as being drawn to scale, which Aindow’s
drawings are not, meaningful measurements cannot be taken from

them.

The appellants argue that the present case is more similar

to In re Heinrich, 268 F.2d 753, 122 USPQ 388 (CCPA 1959) than to

any of the above cases (request, page 3). The court in Heinrich,

268 F.2d at 755-56, 122 USPQ at 390, stated:

Each of the appealed claims calls for a taper of less
than 75° as projected against a plane parallel to the
axis of the sealing ring. Weis does not specify the
angle of taper but the board stated that the taper
shown in his drawing is less than 75° and that
statement is not questioned here by appellant. While
it is true that patent drawings are not ordinarily
considered to be working drawings drawn to scale, the
only reasonable interpretation of the Weis disclosure
is that a very small angle of taper is to be used and
we are of the opinion that one skilled in the art would
normally use a taper of less than 75° in carrying out
the teachings of the Weis patent, and that such an
angle is, therefore, fairly disclosed by the patent.

The appellants argue that “[h]ad Heinrich claimed a taper angle

of, say, ‘more than 30°’ surely the decision would have come out




*** PAGE 7 ***

different" (request, page 3). That may be correct, considering
that the taper was that of a frusto—conical surface of a sealing
ring.

The present case, in contrast, involves the angle of a jet
for blowing powder off of a web and, unlike in Heinrich, it is
not reasonable to interpret Aindow as requiring a very small
angle of taper. Aindow's illustration of an air jet (figure 5,
item 152) and teaching that the air jet is for blowing powder off
of a web (col. 7, lines 35-39) in no way indicates that the angle
of the air jet to the web is to be limited to that illustrated.
The most reasonable interpretation of the reference is that any
angle which is effective for blowing off the powder is suitable.
As stated in our decision (page 6), one of ordinary skill in the
art, when applying Aindow's air jet to the admitted prior art
paste—point coating and scatter coating device (as, it is
undisputed, the applied prior art would have led such a person to
do), would have optimized the angle of the air jet and thereby
arrived at the steep angles recited in the appellants’ claims.

See In re Boesch, 617 F.2d 272, 276, 205 USPQ 215, 219 (CCPA
