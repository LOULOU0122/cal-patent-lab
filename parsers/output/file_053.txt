I. Introduction

This interference is before a merits panel for a decision on priority
motions regarding Count 2, the sole count in interference. Generally, Count
2 is directed to a detergent tablet that, among other things, has a compressed
region that has a recess containing a solidified solution or melt region. The
Count requires that the compressed portion of the tablet dissolve at a faster
rate than the solidified melt or solution region of the tablet.

Previously, the Board denied junior party Henkel Substantive Motion
4 for priority of invention and dismissed as moot senior party Procter &
Gamble Company “P&G” Substantive Motion 5 (priority of invention) and
Motion 7 (correction of inventorship). (Decision, Paper 115). Henkel
timely sought judicial review by appeal to the Federal Circuit. On appeal,
the Federal Circuit vacated the Board’s denial of Henkel’s motion and
dismissal of P&G’s motions and remanded the case to the Board for further
proceedings consistent with its opinion. Henkel Corp. v. Procter & Gamble
Co., 485 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

There are two motions awaiting decision: P&G Motion 7 to correct
inventorship and P&G Motion 5 for judgment on priority.1 Henkel opposes
both motions.

P&G has proven by clear and convincing evidence that an Alasdair

McGregor was a joint inventor as he contributed to the conception of the

1 During the preliminary motions phase, P&G filed a P&G Motion 5 to
correct inventorship (Paper 57), and Henkel opposed (Paper 60). The Board
dismissed the motion and opposition without prejudice to renew during the
priority phase of the interference. (Paper 65). Apparently, P&G
rnisnumbered its priority motion as “P&G Motion 5.” For purposes of this
opinion, unless otherwise stated, any reference to P&G Motion 5 is intended
to reference P&G’s priority motion.

invention in a manner that was not insignificant in quality. Further, P&G
tells a straightforward and simple story regarding reduction to practice.
Specifically, a McGregor Record of Invention (ROI) describes a procedure
for making tablets having certain physical properties including a concavity
into which is dropped a polyethylene glycol melt. The ROI teaches that the
polyethylene glycol is selected to control the temperature at which it starts to
melt/dissolve in the wash cycle. A laboratory technician working for a
named inventor, Metzger-Groom, tested tablets made according to the
procedure described in McGregor’s ROI. The tablets worked for their
intended purpose. This result was then shared with the named inventor as
well as McGregor prior to Henkel’s earliest actual reduction to practice.
Based on the evidence, we hold that P&G has proved by at least a
preponderance of the evidence that it made, and at least one inventor
appreciated, an embodiment within the scope of Count 2, the sole count in
the interference, prior to Henkel’s earliest actual reduction to practice.

Judgment on priority of invention is awarded against Henkel.

H. Procedural History

The Board declared this interference and designated Henkel as the
junior party based on an accorded priority date of December 30, 1997 and
designated P&G senior party based on its accorded priority date of
November 19, 1997.

The parties disputed the scope of the count, and in particular, the
manner in which a difference in dissolution rates was determined. Based on
the parties’ arguments, the Board construed the count as requiring that a
difference in dissolution rates is determined by measuring and calculating

the dissolution rates. Having construed the count, the Board then analyzed




*** PAGE 4 ***


Henkel’s alleged conception and actual reduction to practice.

Based upon its ﬁndings, the Board held that Henkel had failed to
corroborate by a preponderance of the evidence that its named inventors
conceived of an embodiment within the scope of the count prior to P&G’s
accorded beneﬁt date. In particular, the Board found that Henkel failed to
demonstrate that the inventor’s conceived of the dissolution rate difference
embodied in the Count. The Board held that an actual reduction to practice
requires a contemporaneous appreciation of an embodiment within the scope
of the count. The Board concluded that, as Henkel’s inventors had not been
shown to have conceived of the invention, the inventors could not have
contemporaneously appreciated the invention.

On appeal Henkel challenged the Board’s construction of the count
and the Board’s ﬁndings as to actual reduction to practice. Henkel Corp. at
1374. As to the count, the Federal Circuit agreed that Henkel’s priority
motion provided calculations of dissolution rates, but held that Henkel did
not concede that a calculation was required. The Federal Circuit determined
that for purposes of the count “an explicit calculation or measurement of
quantitative dissolution rates is unnecessary.” Id. As to Henkel’s actual
reduction to practice, the Federal Circuit stated that the inventor’s
appreciation of the dissolution rates was demonstrated by a laboratory
technicians observations coupled with evidence that he worked under the
close supervision of the inventor. Id. at 1375. Specifically, the Federal
Circuit found that:

Moreover, SchliWka's observations, coupled with the
record evidence of his interactions with Holderbaum, sufﬁce to
demonstrate appreciation of the different dissolution rates. As a
matter of law, we do not require that a junior party in an
interference demonstrate that it recognized the exact language




*** PAGE 5 ***


of the ultimate count— only the subject matter of the invention.
See Mycogen Plant Sci., Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 243 F.3d 1316,
1336 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that there was sufficient
appreciation when an inventor recognized a process in terms of
codons—groups of three nucleotides—instead of the ultimately
claimed nucleotides). This is not a case in which there is a
signiﬁcant danger that the inventors unwittingly and
accidentally created something new; rather, they set out to
design detergent tablets with a particular structure and did so,
and the only question is whether they appreciated that the
tablets met one limitation of the interference count. Schliwka's
direct visual observation is enough to demonstrate that the
tablet met the “faster rate” limitation.

Schliwka, of course, is not an inventor. However,
Holderbaurn's statements demonstrate that he was aware of
Schliwka's results. In his own Words, he “supervised  Mr.
Schliwka and conferred with [hi]m on virtually a daily basis
and was well aware of [his] activities and results.” Interference
Opinion, slip op. at 11, ‘j[ 29 (emphasis added). Holderbaum
made this statement in the specific context of Schliwka's
recognition of the dissolution rates: “[Sch]iwka] tested the Ring
tabs  and found that the Ring tab partially dissolved, but that
the solidified melt filling did not dissolve.” Id. It is true that the
declarations submitted to the Board do not detail a speciﬁc
conversation or explicitly aver that the inventors appreciated the
specific limitation at the time of Schliwka's experiments, but
such a formulaic affirmation is unnecessary under the facts of
this case. The limitation in question is a discemible property of
the invention that was directly observed by a technician
working under the close supervision of one of the inventors. To
require a more speciﬁc declaration than Henkel has proferred
would be to undermine our holding in Mycogen that an inventor
can demonstrate appreciation without enunciating the precise
language of the interference count.

'. at 1375-76). The Federal Circuit detennined that the appreciation was
roborated based upon Mrs. Nejtek’s test results being provided to an
'entor. While Nejte ’s “results” were directed to cleaning capacity, the




*** PAGE 6 ***


Federal Circuit found this to be sufficient corroboration stating that:

Moreover, the evidence shows that Schliwka communicated his
understanding to Holderbaum. Both Schliwka and Holderbaum
testified that they worked closely together and that Holderbaum
was aware of Schliwka's results. In addition, Nejtek's testing
confirms the existence of the invention, and Dr. Jeschke
testified that he reported her results to a group of inventors,
including Holderbaum, no later than May 1997.
(Id.). The Federal Circuit concluded that the Board erred in denying
Henkel’s priority motion. The Federal Circuit vacated the denial of the

Henkel’s motion and the dismissal of P&G’s motions as moot and remanded

the case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.

C. Accorded Priority Benefit

1. Senior Party P&G
8) For the purpose of 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) priority, P&G’s involved ‘564
patent has been accorded the following earlier constructive reductions to
practice (i.e., priority beneﬁt):

i) PCT/US98/25074, ﬁled November 24, 1998

ii) Provisional Application 60/066,093, filed November 26, 1997.

(Paper No. 87, HI 7).

2. Junior Party Henkel
9) For the purpose of 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) priority, Henkel’s involved
‘434 application has been accorded the following earlier constructive
reductions to practice:

i) PCT/EP98/07153, filed November 9, 1998

i) DE 19758183.8, filed December 30, 1997.
(Redeclaration, Paper No. 87, HI 5).

inventors appreciated a detergent tablet having a compressed region that
dissolved faster than a non-compressed region “prior to the critical date.”

Henkel Corp. at 1376.




*** PAGE 10 ***


12) The Federal Circuit held that non-inventor testimony corroborated

Dr. Holderbaum’s, a Henkel inventor’s, appreciation of the invention by no

later than May 1997. Id.

13) The Federal Circuit did not identify a specific date in May 1997 for
the corroboration of Dr. Holberbaum’s appreciation of the invention
however, on the facts of this case the specific date is moot as P&G has

demonstrated an actual reduction to practice in February 1997.

D. P&G’s Evidence on Priority of Invention
P&G submitted numerous exhibits in support of its motion on priority
of invention and inventorship. The exhibits and relevant findings regarding

these exhibits are summarized below.

14) From at least November 1996 to May 1, 1997, the following people
were P&G automatic dishwashing project team members: Alasdair

McGregor, Lynda Speed, Jeff Painter, Sabine Metzger-Groom.

Sabine Metzger-Groom Worked on project team with McGregor and
Speed. Was supervised by Speed. Made and
tested McGregor dimpled tablets. Reported
results of testing in monthly report for period
ending January 1, 1997, which confirmed
carotenoid stain removal and slower dissolution
of noncompressed melt dimple versus
compressed tablet.

1. McGregor’s Declaration Testimony
McGregor testiﬁes to the following:
16) That he was on the same project team, automatic dishWashing,2 as
Lynda Speed, Jeff Painter and Sabine Metzger-Groom at the P&G
Newcastle Technical Center between at least about November 1996 and

May 1, 1997. (PX 1028, ‘H 11).

2 While McGregor’s declaration does not identify what project the team was
working on, Painter’s testimony identifies the team project as relating to
automatic dishwashing. (PX 1036, ‘j[ 4).

11




*** PAGE 12 ***


17) He was in regular communication with the project members, and in
particular, with Lynda Speed who he generally communicated on a weekly
basis and Metzger-Groom whom he frequently had conversations with

regarding the project. (Id. at ‘H 11, 14).

18) As required by management, his standard practice was to publish
monthly reports within one week after the end of the month. (Id. at ‘H 5).

19) He published his April 1996 monthly report (PX 1023), which
describes his work in increasing the dissolution rate of the compressed
tablets by reducing the tabletting pressure, increasing the hydration of the

phosphate in the tablet and by increasing the surface area of the tablet by
dimpling the surface of the tablet. (Id. at ‘H 6).

20) He published his May 1996 monthly report (PX 1024), which
describes his work in increasing the dissolution rate of the tablet by
increasing the level of phosphate hydration and his intent to prepare a

Record of Invention documenting the dissolution benefits from using the

higher hydration levels. (Id. at ‘H 7).

21) He published his November 1996 monthly report (PX 1025), which
describes his successes in demonstrating that the European Tablets (ET)
dissolved at a sufficient rate to meet project performance criteria due to

increase hexahydrate conversion and reduced hardness of the tablet. (Id. at

‘J1 8)-

22) He prepared an ROI (PX 1009) and sent the R01 to his senior

12




*** PAGE 13 ***


manager, Michael Addison on or about November 22, 1996. (Id. at SI 12).

23) He communicated with Lynda Speed and Jeff Painter, a named
inventor on the involved ‘564 patent, on at least one occasion before
November 22, 1996 with respect to the development described in the ROI.
(Id. at ‘][ 1 1).

24) Prior to November 22, 1996 Lynda Speed shared her perspective
regarding the release of actives from a detergent tablet. (Id.).

25) Prior to November 22, 1996, McGregor asked Jeff Painter about
materials, such as waxes, that would start to melt/dissolve at various

temperatures. (Id.).

26) Jeff Painter shared his perspective on the use of PEG and NB-base in
a detergent tablet with McGregor prior to November 22, 1996 and this
communication is evidenced by McGregor’s ROI. (Id.).

27) He authored the ROI, which describes compressed tablets having a
cavity and a solidiﬁed melt in the cavity “dimpled tablets,” and sent the R01
to his manager Michael Addison on or about November 22, 1996. (Id. at

‘J[12).

28) He made the tablets described in Examples 1-3 of the ROI no later
than November 22, 1996. (Id. at‘][ 13).

29) In early January 1997 he read Sabine Metzger-Groom’s January 1,

13




*** PAGE 14 ***


1997 monthly report (PX 1033), which reported that dimpled tablets, made
according the procedure set forth in his ROI where the dimple contains NB-

base and PEG 3000, worked for its intended purpose of carotenoid stain
removal. (Id. at‘][ 14 and PX 1033).

30) Based on his membership on the same project as Sabine Metzger-
Groom and his frequent conversations regarding the project with her,
McGregor would have discussed the data with her shortly after the
generation of the data was reported in Metzger-Groom’s January report.

(PX 1028 at g1 14).

31) He published his Januaiy 1997 monthly report (PX 1026), which
describes his work on tablets having prehydrated phosphate with 12%
moisture. (Id. at ‘H 9).

32) He published his February 1997 monthly report (PX 1026), which
describes his dimpled tablets as providing ﬂexibility to control the

dissolution rate of the actives suspended in the tablet and the filing of the
ROI. (Id. at ‘J[ 10).

33) He worked with patent practitioner Claire Goodier in her drafting of
the February 14, 1997 and June 2, 1997 patentability opinions relating to the
subject matter of his ROI. (Id. at ‘H 15).

34) That he knew, on or before February 14, 1997, that the compressed
region of his detergent tablet dissolved at a greater rate than the non-

compressed region. (PX 1042, ‘j[ 4).

14




*** PAGE 15 ***


35) His work through 1996 was directed to finding ways of increasing the
dissolution rate of the compressed region, as evidenced by his monthly

reports. (Id. at ‘]I 5).

36) His work described in the ROI demonstrates his interest in slowing

the dissolution of the non-compressed region of the tablet, i.e., the solidified
melt dimple. (Id. at ‘H 6-7).

37) That the use of a PEG 3,000 dimple was to delay the delivery of the
actives to a point where they were most effective in the wash cycle and he
and his project team appreciated this fact at the time of the ROI, and
certainly by the date of the first patentability opinion, February 14, 1997.
(Id. at ‘][‘J[ 8- 10).

38) That, while his laboratory notebooks he kept during 1996 and 1997
were lost, the ROI, patentability opinions, and his monthly reports accurately
demonstrate that, by at least February 14, 1997, he appreciated that the
solidiﬁed melt portion of his dimpled tablets dissolved at a slower rate than
the compressed region of the tablet. (Id. at ‘J[ 11).

39) Regarding the loss of McGregor’s notebooks, David Smith testifies
that he was McGregor’s immediate supervisor at the time of the ROI. (PX

1029, ‘ll 6).

40) Smith testiﬁes that he and McGregor discussed the loss of the
notebooks in June 2004 and that apparently McGregor’s notebooks were left

15




*** PAGE 16 ***


on his desk upon transferring out from P&G’s technical center at Newcastle,
England. (Id.).

41) Smith testifies as to his efforts to locate McGregor’s notebooks
surrounding the developments in the ROI but states that the notebooks have
not been located and are likely lost. (Id. at ‘M 6-8).

42) Smith’s testimony is credible on its face and the loss of the notebooks
does not appear to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny of the underlying records

surrounding the ROI.

2. Addison’s Declaration Testimony (PX 1041)
43) M.C. Addison testiﬁes that he was an Associate Director at P&G
between Nov. 1, 1996 and July 1, 1997. (PX 1041, ‘j[ 4).

request to prepare a patent application based on the ROI (PX 1040). (Id. at

‘l 5)-

45) Addison witnessed the ROI and understood its meaning and
significance as he was McGregor’s manager and “was well aware of the

work he was performing.” (Id. at ‘J[ 6).

46) Addison was responsible for reading documents, like the ROI, to

determine if they merited the resources to file a patent application. (Id.).

47) Addison provided authorization (PX 1040) for a patentability opinion

16




*** PAGE 17 ***


from a patent attorney and although he didn’t date the correspondence
authorizing the patentability opinion, the date stamp demonstrates it was

signed on or before February 26, 1997. (Id.).

that ultimately granted as the ‘564 patent. (Id. at ‘]I 5).

50) Goodier communicated with McGregor, Speed and Metzger-Groom

before authoring and issuing her patentability opinions. (Id.).

51) Goodier was in regular communication with McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom and attended the majority of project meetings at Newcastle
Technical Center that would include the attendance of McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom. (Id.).

52) Goodier testifies that it was established before Feb. 14, 1997 that the
dissolution rate of the non-compressed region of the tablet was decreased by

the use of PEG. (Id. at ‘H 6).

53) Goodier testifies that on at least one occasion prior to June 2, 1997,
the project team, including Speed, discussed data generated regarding the

dissolution rate of the compressed and non-compressed region of the tablet

71) Metzger-Groom testiﬁes that she had several meetings between at
least about November 22, 1996 and June 2, 1997 with McGregor, Speed and

20




*** PAGE 21 ***


Goodier and other members of the project team regarding the ROI. (PX
1034, ‘H 4).

72) Metzger-Groom testifies that McGregor and Speed were on her
project team and located at the same facility at this time and that Speed was

her immediate manager during this period. (Id.).

73) Metzger-Groom testifies that, as project team members, McGregor,
Speed and her “met often discussing our data and results on a regular basis,

if not at least on a weekly basis.” (Id.).

74) Metzger-Groom testifies that it was her regular practice to publish
monthly reports summarizing her work and that it was her standard practice
to publish the reports within one Week after the end of the month, as required
by management. (Id. at ‘H 5).

75) Metzger-Groom testifies that she authored and published the report
(PX 1033) that describes her work conducted in December 1996 up until
January 1, 1997. (Id.).

76) Metzger-Groom testifies that Lynda Speed was her manager at the
time she conducted the work described in her monthly report, PX 1033, and
that she reported the data described in the monthly report to Lynda Speed
shortly after generating the data. (Id.).

77) Metzger-Groom testifies she made the dimple tablet described in her

report according to the method developed by McGregor as detailed in the

21




*** PAGE 22 ***


ROI and tl1at the dimple tablet contained PEG 3000 and NB-base particles to
fill the dimple. (Id. at ‘H 6).

78) Metzger-Groom testiﬁes that her testing of the dimple tablet
demonstrated that the tablet “achieved success by demonstrating 61%

carotenoid stain removal.” (Id.).

7. Declaration of David Smith (PX 1029)
79) Smith declares that he has a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical
Engineering and has been employed with the Research and Development

Department of P&G since 1987. (PX 1029, ‘ll 4).

80) Smith is a person of ordinary skill in the detergent art based upon his

education and professional experience. (Id.).

81) Smith testifies that he and his assistant, Caroline McCardle,
essentially reproduced the tablet of Example 2 of McGregor’s ROI and that
this tablet is an embodiment within the scope of Count 2. (Id. at ‘J[ 9).

82) Smith testifies that the notebook pages documenting the work
conducted with Caroline McCardle are presented as PX 1037. (Id.).

83) Smith testifies that tablet was made according to ROI with only three
“very minor substitutions given that these ingredients are no longer

commercially available since the product was made close to nine years ago.”

(Id. at ‘][ 10).

22




*** PAGE 23 ***


84) Smith testifies that the substitutions included substituting physically

identical enzyme particles, one perfume for another and a closely related

SLF 18-B45 surfactant for surfactant SL-18-B46. (Id.).

85) Smith testifies that these substitutions would not materially affect the

dissolution rate of the tablet or the compressed region of the tablet. (Id.).

86) Sn1ith’s reproduced tablet has a dissolution rate of 0.28 g/rnin for the

compressed region and 0.21 g/n1in for the solidified melt region using the

SOTAX Dissolution Test Method. (Id. at ‘H 9).

87) Smith testifies that the surface area of the solidified melt region of the
tablet was 8.7% relative to the detergent tablet as a whole. (Id. at ‘H 13,

p. 10).

8. Alasdair Duncan McGregor Pre-ROI Monthly Reports
88) McGregor’s April 1996 report provides the following summary:

This monthly report summarizes the current status of ideas to
increase the dissolution rate of phosphate tablets:
Increasing the hydration state of the phosphate.
Incorporating a tablet disintegrant into the phosphate
matrix.
Contouring of the tablet surface.

(PX 1023).
89) The April 1996 report states that a 100% increase in surface area can
be achieved by contouring the surface of the tablets, like a golf ball, and

states that the contouring can be accomplished with tablet punch heads.

23




*** PAGE 24 ***


(Id.).

90) The April 1996 report also states that increasing the hydration of the
phosphate allows for a 3 minute increase in dissolution time for the tablet.

(Id.).

91) McGregor’s May 1996 provides data from experiments on increasing
the level of phosphate hydration with the fastest dissolution times achieved
using higher phosphate hydration levels. (PX 1024).

92) The May 1996 report states that increasing the phosphate hydration
level will increase the dissolution rate for tablets of equal hardness. (Id.).

93) The May 1996 report also states that an ROI will be prepared to
document the dissolution benefits of phosphate with higher hydration levels.
(Id.).

94) McGregor’s November 1996 report states:

The European Tablet (ET) now dissolves at a sufficient rate into
the wash so as to meet the project performance criteria.
Increased phosphate hexa-hydrate conversion and reduced
hardness have achieved this increase in dissolution rate.

(PX 1025).

9. McGregor Record of Invention (“ROI”) dated November
22, 1996 (PX 1009)

95) P&G has submitted an exhibit entitled “RECORD OF INVENTION”




*** PAGE 25 ***


(“ROI”). (PX 1009, p. 1).

96) The ROI identiﬁes Alasdair McGregor of the “Dish Process Dev.” as
the compiler of the ROI and a compilation date of November 22, 1996.

97) P&G’s ROI is entitled “Dimpled Tablets: Reactive raw materials

delivered via an inert carrier to maintain raw material activity.” (Id.).

98) The ROI contains two signature blocks, one for the signature of
“Director, Associated Director or Department Head” and one for “Patent

Counsel.” (Id.).

99) A “T.N. Gibson” signature is adjacent to the Patent Counsel signature

block and, while not entirely legible, what appears to be a signature of a “M.

C. Addison” is adjacent to the Director signature block. (Id.).

100) The ROI states that a legal opinion on the development described

therein is believed to involve worthwhile novel subject matter. (ROI, PX

1009, p. 1).

101) The ROI identifies the following problem in the art:

In general raw materials which have been tabletted are
inherently less stable than in granular form. Therefore some
raw materials which can be delivered in a granular product form
are unstable in a tablet form and lose their activity. This
reduces performance of the product.

i.e. Tergitol — grease cleaning surfactant is unstable in a

tablet
NB Base — cartenoid stain remover is unstable in a tablet

25




*** PAGE 26 ***


(Id.).

102)

The ROI further states that:

Via this development, highly active ingredients that would
normally be untablettable can be included in tablet form, by
adding a highly active ingredient via an unreactive rr1ix onto the
surface of a tablet as a) a coating, b) as a filling for an
indentation on the surface of a tablet.

au.at2)

103)

The ROI states that highly active ingredients can be incorporated into

a tablet form without losing activity by using a “dimple approach.” (Id.).

104)

(Id.).

105)

The ROI describes its dimple approach as follows:

i) A solid or liquid reactive raw material is
suspended in a molten mix of an unreactive (inert) material
which will remain at reasonable temperatures above ambient.

ii) A tablet is tabletted with a concave face (dimple)
or multiple dimples (the indentation can be of any shape or
form), i.e.

iii) The molten mix of reactive raw material and inert

carrier, is dropped onto the surface of the tablet and allowed to
cool or a solid mix is pressed onto the surface of the tablet.

 

The ROI describes controlling the delivery of raw materials into the

wash as follows:

26




*** PAGE 27 ***


Particular raw materials can be delivered into the wash at a
specific time/temperature in the wash cycle so as to maximize
performance potential by:

i) Tablets are prepared as described above.

ii) The inert carrier is chosen carefully so that it only
starts to melt/dissolve at a certain temperature in the wash
cycle. This temperature should coincide with the optimum
release time/temperature for the raw material suspended in the
PEG.

(Melting Point)

i.e.. PEG 900 36 °C

PEG 1000 39 °C
PEG 1500 45 °C
PEG 8000 62 °C

(Id. at 3).

106) The ROI provides three examples of dimpled detergent tablets and a

schematic blockﬂow diagram of the tabletting process.

107) The three examples contain generally the same compressed tablet

portions. Examples 1 and 2 describe the compressed granule portion of the

tablet as having:

53.82% phosphate (12% moisture),
15% 2 R sodium silicate,

14% sodium carbonate

1 1.61% PB 1

1.5% Green Amalyse 120CT/PCA
1.26% Protease (FN3) 20CT

2.0% SLF 18-B46

0.5% Paraffin Oil

0.3% BTA

0.01 Perfume (jaffi)

(Id. at 5-6).

27




*** PAGE 28 ***


108) Example 3 contains the same ingredients and proportions as Examples
1 and 2 except that Example 3 contained 55.32% of the phosphate and 0%
Green Amylase. (Id. at 7).

109) The granules of Example 1 were tabletted with a dimple as follows:

These granules were tabletted @ 7tonf to a hardness of 21kg
and a weight of 20g with convex top punch. Dies + lower
punches diameter (mm): 34.0 Upper punches, hemispherical
dimple diameter (mm): 20mm

(Id. at 5).

110) The granules of Examples 2 and 3 were tabletted the same way as
Example 1 except that the diameter of the dimple was 10 mm. (Id. at 6-7).

11 1) Example 1 describes its dimpled tablet as a Tergitol (grease cleaner)
stability ﬁx where the dimple was formed by dropping a liquid mixture of
Tergitol and PEG 10,000 into the dimple on the compressed tablet. (Id. at
5).

112) Example 2 describes its dimpled tablet as a NB Base (cartenoid stain
remover) stability ﬁx where the dimple was formed by dropping a mixture
of NB Base and PEG 4,000 into the dimple on the compressed tablet. (Id. at
6).

113) Example 3 describes its dimpled tablet as an optimum performance
PCA Base (bleach catalyst) tablet where the dimple was formed by dropping

28




*** PAGE 29 ***


a mixture of Amalyse l20CT/PCA and PEG 3,000 into the dimple on the
compressed tablet. (Id. at 7).

114) The ROI contains a schematic blockﬂow diagram of the tabletting
process for “Dimpled ET.” (Id. at 8).

115) The schematic from page 8 of the R01 is reproduced below:

The above schematic depicts what is said to be a blockﬂow diagram of an
ET (European Tablet) automatic dishwashing tabletting process.

116) The lower right hand corner of the schematic has a date of “28/10/96.”

117) The schematic depicts a resulting tablet having the same ingredients

as Example 1 as follows:

ELDIQQJIMH

11  bani
30 min: dissolution

 

(Id. at 8). The above tablet has a dimple that covers less than 40% of the
total surface area of the tablet (top, bottom and sides).

118) The ROI identiﬁes the chronology of events in the development of the

tablet as including:

September ’96 In work to identify a ﬁx for delivering
Tergitol in tablets the idea to separate tergitol from the main
body of the tablet and apply it via an inert carrier was
identified.

November ’96 Initial laboratory scale work was carried out

31




*** PAGE 32 ***


to identify a suitable inert carrier (i.e. PEG 10 000) and identify
the performance benefits.

(Id. at 9).

119) Mr. McGregor signed the ROI but did not identify anyone else as
contributing to the “initial idea.” (Id. at 9).

9. Sabine Metzger-Groom January 1997 Monthly Report
120) P&G submitted an exhibit PX 1033, which is a single page “Cleaning
Monthly Report” of Sabine U. Metzger-Groom.

121) The monthly report has a “period ending” date of 1/1/97 on the upper

left corner of the report.

122) The report has a title “DIMPLE TABLET PROMISING CONCEPT
FOR SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF NB-BASE.”

123) The top of the report states that:

A new idea in ADW is the “dimple tablet.” We are currently
looking into Ways to use this concept to overcome the storage
stability problems seen with NB-base in regular tablets, and to
deliver the carotenoid stain removal beneﬁt.

124) The report states that the dimple tablet concept enables “physically
separate currently incompatible active ingredients in tablet formation and

appropriate rate of delivery of new technologies.”

125) Under the heading of “Current Status,” the report describes a dimple

32




*** PAGE 33 ***


tablet developed with A.D. McGregor having a dimple containing “PEG
3000 (low melting point ~45°C) and NB-base particles.”

126) The report states that dimple tablets had been placed in storage “with

and w/o NB-base” for two and four weeks at ambient and 40 °C.

127) The report states that the dimple tablet was stable up to at least 40 °C.

128) The report states that dimple tablets were tested for carotenoid stain
removal and were slightly worse than that of regular tablets, the difference
being 61% stain removal with ET tablet with dimple versus 65-68% stain

removal for regular ET tablets.

129) The report identifies two potential reasons for the slight loss in
performance including the “slower release of the NB-base from the dimple

versus the regular tablets.”

130) The report, under the heading “Next steps” states that NB-base
activity prior to and after storage and performance after storage will be

tested early January 1997.

131) Also under the heading, “Next steps” the report states that an
investigation is underway into the hypothesis that early release of NB-base
from the tablet is critical to the performance of the tablet and that using

lower molecular weight PEG and fizzy tablets may facilitate such a release.

132) The report also identiﬁes a future design of the tablet as potentially

33




*** PAGE 34 ***


including a NB-base in a low molecular weight PEG/fizzy matrix to ensure
the faster release of the NB-base as compared to the release of an active

(GCS system) in the compressed portion of the tablet.

133) The reported observation of slower release of NB-base from the melt
region as compared to the compressed region is consistent with the future

investigations of using a lower molecular weight PEG to speed the release of

the NB-base.

10. McGregor’s Post-ROI Monthly Reports
134) McGregor’s January 1997 monthly report states that pre-hydrated
phosphate improved the dissolution of the tablet and identifies a 12%

moisture level, which is the same level exemplified in McGregor’s ROI.

(PX 1026).

135) McGregor’s January 1997 monthly report states that 4 week storage
data for tablets at elevated temperature and humidity was being collected

with results due January 2, 1997. (PX 1026).

136) McGregor’s February 1997 monthly report provides the following
summary of his work on dimpled tablets:

The “dimpled” tablet is a new concept in ADW tabletting. It
combines the main detergent ingredients in a traditional tablet
base using a convex upper punch. This leaves a dimple in the
upper surface of the tablet which can then be filled with active
ingredients which would otherwise be untablettable. This
concept introduces 2 potentially revolutionary advantages.

1) The ﬂexibility to independently control the
dissolution rate of actives suspended in the dimple.

34




*** PAGE 35 ***


2) The ﬂexibility to incorporate active ingredients in
a tablet form without exposing these ingredients to the high
forces traditionally associated with detergent tabletting and
hence the potential to lose activity.

An ROI has now been filed which encompasses this
general concept with particular reference to incorporating
Tergitol and/or NB-base in a tablet form.

(PX 1027).

11. Claire Goodier Patentability Opinion - February 14, 1997
137) Claire Goodier prepared a patentability opinion that is said to
correspond to ROI 2028 by Alasdair McGregor. (PX 1030).

138) The number 2028 appears on the bottom of the first page of
McGregor’s November 22, 1996 ROI. (PX 1030, p. 1).

139) The patentability report (PX 1030) has a date of February 14, 1997 in
the upper comer of the first page and is addressed to M.C. Addison, which

was McGregor’s supervisor.
140) The February patentability report identifies the subject of the report
as: “Dimpled Tablets — reactive/unstable raw materials delivered in a tablet

by Way of an inert carrier.” (PX 1030, p. 1).

141) The February report describes a problem in the art with stability of
active materials in a tablet, e.g., they lose their reactivity. (Id.).

142) The February report states that the invention is to include ingredients

35




*** PAGE 36 ***


on a dimple on the surface of a tablet where a tablet press compacts
ingredients to form a tablet body, which is then modiﬁed to have a convex
surface. The cavity is then filled with a mixture of an inert carrier and

ingredients that could not have been tabletted. (Id.).

143) The February report states:

An additional benefit associated with this development is the
ability to accelerate or delay the release time of the ingredient
held in the tablet dimple, since the inert carrier can be selected
for a particular melting temperature achieved during the
machine wash cycle.

(Id. at 2).

12. Request for Patent Application — February 26, 1997
144) A request for a patent application was signed by M.C. Addison and
identifies the recipient as “C-L Goodier.” (PX 1040).

145) The request states that it corresponds to McGregor’s R01 2028 and
the request states that the subject of the request is:

Dimpled Tablets — reactive/unstable raw materials delivered in
a tablet by way of an inert canier.

(Id.).

146) The request states:

I authorize the preparation of a Patent Application based on
ROI 2028 with the Claim scope as outlined in your patentability
opinion.

(Id.).

36




*** PAGE 37 ***


147) The request has a received date of February 26, 1997. (Id.).

13. Claire Goodier Patentability Opinion - June 2, 1997
148) Claire Goodier prepared a patentability opinion that is said to be an
“update” of the patentability opinion on R01 2028. (PX 1031).

149) The patentability report (PX 1031) has a date of June 2, 1997 in the
upper comer of the ﬁrst page and is addressed to M.C. Addison, which was
McGregor’s supervisor. (Id. at 1).

150) The June patentability report refers back to a patentability opinion
written in February 1997. (Id.).

151) The June patentability report describes R01 2028 as relating to dimple
tablets having incompatible ingredients delivered via a solidifying liquid in a
cavity on the surface of a compressed tablet. (Id.).

152) The June patentability report contains five (5) claims directed to
detergent tablets having a compressed portion and a non-compressed

portion. (Id.).
153) Claims 1 and 2 of the June report require the tablet have a dissolution

rate of greater than 20 g/hr as determined using the SOTAX dissolution
method. (Id.).

IV. Opinion

An interference is a procedure to determine who among competing
parties was the first to invent a commonly claimed invention. 35 U.S.C.
§§ 102(g) and 135 (a). To succeed, a party in an interference need only
demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it was the first to invent
where the involved patent and application were co-pending before the
USPTO. See, Eli Lilly & Co. v. Aradigm Corp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1365 (Fed.
Cir. 2004).

P&G Motion 7 contends that Alasdair McGregor was a joint inventor
for the claimed subject matter of P&G’s involved ‘564 patent. P&G’s
Motion 5 for priority contends that McGregor and/or Speed reduced to
practice the invention of Count 2, the sole count in interference, prior to
Henkel’s earliest actual reduction to practice. (P&G Motion 5, Paper 93).

The rules authorize the Board to take up motions for decisions in any
order. 37 C.F.R. § 41.125(a) (2007). We elect to consider P&G’s motion to
add McGregor as an inventor, as a determination of joint inventorship
identifies whether objective evidence is needed to corroborate McGregor’s

subjective testimony regarding his understanding of the invention.
Invitrogen Corp. v. Clontech Labs., Inc., 429 F.3d 1052, 1065 (Fed. Cir.
2005).

A. P&G Motion 7: Motion to Correct Inventorship
P&G’s involved ‘564 patent names on its face Lynda Speed and
Jeffrey Painter as inventors. (‘564 patent, PX 1004). P&G Motion 7

requests that Alasdair Duncan McGregor be added as an inventor on the

‘564 patent. (Paper 94). Henkel opposes. (Paper 100).

38




*** PAGE 39 ***


1. Statute and Case Law on Joint Inventorship

35 U.S.C. § 256 provides that the Director may, with proof of the
facts and such other requirements, issue a certificate correcting an error in
inventorship of an issued patent where such error arose without any
deceptive intention.

Inventorship is a mixed question of law and fact where the overall
inventorship determination is a question of law, but is premised on
underlying questions of fact. Univ. of Colo. Found., Inc. v. Am. Cyanamid
Co., 342 F.3d 1298, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The issue of joint inventorship is
governed by 35 U.S.C. §l16, which provides that:

When an invention is made by two or more persons jointly,
they shall apply for patent jointly and each make the required
oath, except as otherwise provided in this title. Inventors may
apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not
physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not
make the same type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did
not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of
the patent.

***

Whenever through error a person is named in an application for
patent as the inventor, or through an error an inventor is not
named in an application, and such error arose without any
deceptive intention on his part, the Director may permit the
application to be amended accordingly, under such terms as he
prescribes.

The Federal Circuit has interpreted §116 as follows:

This provision sets no explicit lower limit on the
quantum or quality of inventive contribution required for a
person to qualify as a joint inventor. Rather, a joint invention is
simply the product of a collaboration between two or more
persons working together to solve the problem addressed.
[citation omitted]. The determination of whether a person is a

39




*** PAGE 40 ***


joint inventor is fact specific, and no bright-line standard will
suffice in every case. [footnote omitted]. Nonetheless, our
precedent provides guidance as to what types of acts are, or are
not, sufficient in quantum and quality to establish joint
inventorship. One need not alone conceive of the entire
invention, for this would obviate the concept of joint
inventorship. However, a joint inventor must contribute in
some signiﬁcant manner to the conception of the invention.
[citations omitted]. As such, “each inventor must contribute to
the joint arrival at a definite and permanent idea of the
invention as it will be used in practice.” Burroughs Wellcome,
40 F.3d at 1229, 32 USPQ2d at 1921.

If a person supplies the required quantum of inventive
contribution, that person does not lose his or her status as a joint
inventor just because he or she used the services, ideas, and aid
of others in the process of perfecting the invention. [citation
omitted]. However, those others may also in appropriate
circumstances become joint inventors by their contributions. In
addition, a person is not precluded from being a joint inventor
simply because his or her contribution to a collaborative effort
is experimental. [citation omitted].

The basic exercise of the normal skill expected of one
skilled in the art, without an inventive act, also does not make
one a joint inventor. [citation omitted]. Therefore, a person will
not be a co-inventor if he or she does no more than explain to
the real inventors concepts that are well known and the current
state of the art. [citation orr1itted]. The case law thus indicates
that to be a joint inventor, an individual must make a
contribution to the conception of the claimed invention that is
not insigniﬁcant in quality, when that contribution is measured
against the dimension of the full invention.

Ia Oil & Chem. Co. v. Ewen, 123 F.3d 1466, 1473 (Fed. Cir. 1997). ']
zleral Circuit has also held that:

For persons to be joint inventors under Section 116, there must
be some element of joint behavior, such as collaboration or
working under common direction, one inventor seeing a
releva.nt report and building upon it or hearing another’s

40




*** PAGE 41 ***


suggestion at a meeting.

Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Procter & Gamble Distrib. C0., 973 F.2d 911, 917
(Fed. Cir. 1992).

Additionally, it is not enough for an alleged inventor to testify that he
contributed to the conception of the invention. Specifically, “[a]n inventor’s
testimony standing alone, is insufficient to prove conception-some form of
corroboration must be shown.” Price v. Symsek, 988 F.2d 1187, 1196.
Further, the unwitnessed and uncorroborated contemporary laboratory
notebook pages of an inventor generally are accorded no more weight than
the inventor’s subsequent testimony. Reese v. Hurst, 661 F.2d 1222, 1231
(CCPA 1981). The requirement for corroboration of an inventor’s testimony
stems from the concern that a party claiming inventorship might be tempted
to describe his actions in an unjustifiably self-serving manner in order to
obtain a patent or to maintain an existing patent. Shu-Hui Chen v.
Bouchard, 347 F.3d 1299, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, “[t]here is no
single formula that must be followed in proving corroboration.” Berry v.
Webb, 412 F.2d 261, 266 (CCPA 1969). Instead, whether an inventor’s
testimony is corroborated sufficiently should be evaluated using a “rule of
reason.” An evaluation of all pertinent evidence must be undertaken so that
a sound determination of the credibility of an inventor’s story can be made.
Price, 988 F.2d at 1187. Circumstantial evidence of an independent nature
may satisfy the corroboration requirement. Cooper, 154 F.3d at 1330. “In
the final analysis, each corroboration case must be decided on its own facts

with a View to deciding whether the evidence as a whole is persuasive.”

Berges v. Gottstein, 618 F.2d 771, 776 (CCPA 1980).

2. P&G ‘564 Patent Claims
The ‘564 patent contains fourteen (14) claims. ‘564 claims 1-12 are
directed to a detergent tablet. ‘564 claims 13-14 are directed to a method for
washing soiled articles in a washing machine comprising treating the articles
with an aqueous liquid having an effective amount of detergent tablet
dissolved or dispensed therein. (P&G Clean Copy of Claims, Paper 10).
The detergent tablet of P&G independent claim 1 contains a

compressed portion and a non-compressed portion wherein the compressed
portion comprises a mould and dissolves at a faster rate than the non-
compressed portion on a weight by weight basis measured using a SOTAX
dissolution test method. The non-compressed portion of the tablet is in the
form of a solid, gel or liquid form and is delivered into the mould of the

compressed portion and secured to the compressed portion. (Id.).

3. P&G Provides Clear and Convincing Corroborated
Evidence that McGregor Contributed to the Conception
of at Least One P&G Claim
P&G must establish that McGregor contributed to the conception of at
least one claim in a manner that was not insignificant in quality when that
contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention. The
burden of proof in infringement cases before the Federal Circuit has been
held to be clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Hess v. Advanced
Cardiovascular Sys. Inc., 106 F.3d 976, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Before this
agency however, a plausible argument can be made that the standard is a
preponderance of the evidence given that Section 116 is remedial in nature.

Cf In re Schmidt, 293 F.2d 274, 279 (CCPA 1961) (Section 116 is remedial
in nature and should be liberally construed in order to readily rectify errors).

*** PAGE 43 ***


We need not resolve the standard of proof in this agency proceeding as
P&G’s proofs meet both the preponderance of the evidence standard and the

clear and convincing standard.

a. McGregor Conceived of a Compressed Portion of
a Tablet Having a Mould and Dissolves at a Faster
Rate than a Non-Compressed Portion of the Tablet

P&G’s claimed invention requires a tablet having two portions, a
compressed portion and a non-compressed portion. The invention further
requires that the compressed portion have a mould and dissolve at a faster
rate than the non-compressed portion.

McGregor testifies that he “conceived of the idea of a dimple mould
in the [compressed] tablet for purpose of increasing the surface area of the
tablet.” (PX 1028, ‘H 6). McGregor also testifies that he conceived that the
dissolution rate of the compressed tablet may be increased by introducing
phosphate into the tablet matrix and increasing the hydration state of the
phosphate. (Id.). McGregor further testifies that he conceived of reducing
the pressure of the tablet press to increase the dissolution rate of the resulting

tablet. (Id.).

b. McGregor’s Contribution to Conception Was Not
Insignificant in Quality
The ‘594 patent highlights the advantage of having a compressed

region that dissolves at a faster rate as follows:

A further advantage of using a detergent tablet as described
herein, is the performance benefits which may be achieved in
being able to prepare a detergent tablet where the compressed
portion has a faster rate of dissolution than the non-compressed

43




*** PAGE 44 ***


portion.

(‘594, PX 1001, col. 2, 11. 10-14).

McGregor was responsible for the conception of the compressed
portion of the tablet where the compressed portion has a mould. Further,
McGregor was responsible for increasing the rate of dissolution of the
compressed portion, which is said to be a specific advantage of the tablets.
We find that McGregor’s contribution to conception of P&G’s claimed
tablets was not insignificant in quality as the tablet contains only two

portions and he conceived of at least one of them.

c. McGregor Collaborated with Named Inventors

McGregor worked on the automatic dishwashing team along with
Jeffrey Painter, Lynda Speed, and Sabine Metzger-Groom. The team, along
with Claire Goodier, was located at P&G’s Newcastle Technical Center.
(PX 1028, HI 11).

McGregor, Speed and Metzger-Groom testify that, as project team
members, they often met to discuss their data and results. (PX 1028, HIHI 4,
11, PX 1035, HI 6, and PX 1034, HI 4). Further, McGregor, Speed and Painter
testify that, prior to November 22, 1996, they had specific communications
regarding the developments reported in the McGregor’s ROI. (PX 1028, HI
11, PX 1035, HI 5 and PX 1036, HI 4). In particular, McGregor, Speed and
Painter testify that, prior to November 22, 1996, Speed shared her expertise
in the release of actives with McGregor and Painter shared his perspective of
using PEG and NB-base in a detergent tablet. (PX 1028, HI 11, PX 1035 , HI 5,
and PX 1306, HI 4). This is consistent with McGregor’s monthly reports and
ROI. Specifically, McGregor’s November 1, 1997 monthly report discusses

44




*** PAGE 45 ***


ET tablets and their dissolution but does not mention a delayed release
dimple, yet McGregor’s November 22, 1997 ROI describes using PEG and
NB-base in a solidified melt dimple.

Further evidence of collaboration between at least McGregor and
Speed on the claimed tablets is demonstrated by McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom’s regular communication with Claire Goodier, P&G’s
patent attorney, regarding the drafting of her patentability opinions, which
were based on McGregor’s ROI and which resulted in the ﬁling of the
application that issued as the ‘564 patent. (PX 1028, ‘H 11, PX 1035, ‘][‘j[ 6-7
and PX 1032, ‘H 5).

Based upon the evidence presented, we find that McGregor
collaborated with at least one inventor to solve the problem addressed,
which was the design and development of an automatic dishwashing tablet
with a delayed release non-compressed portion as compared to the

compressed portion.

d. McGregor’s Contribution to the Conception of the
Invention is Corroborated

We review the record as a whole to understand whether McGregor’s
contribution to conception is corroborated. Our review reveals a
straightforward and consistent story. Generally, the named inventors as well
as Alasdair McGregor and Sabine Metzger-Groom worked on the same
project team and were located at the same facility. McGregor was in regular
communication with the project members, and in particular, with Lynda
Speed with whom he generally communicated on a weekly basis. McGregor

conceived of a compressed detergent tablet (“ET tablet”) that had a

45




*** PAGE 46 ***


concavity on its surface to increase the dissolution of the compressed tablet.
Painter and Speed shared their expertise and perspective on using PEG and
NB-base in a detergent tablet. After conversations with Painter and Speed,
McGregor drafted an ROI that describes a dimpled tablet having a
compressed portion with hydrated phosphate that has a dimpled concavity
on its surface and a dimple portion having actives, such as NB-base, and a
controlled release PEG carrier. Further, McGregor, Speed and Metzger-
Groom worked with P&G’s attorney in the preparation of patentability
opinions based on “McGregor’ s” ROI and the subsequent application that
issued as the involved ‘564 patent.3
Further evidence of corroboration for McGregor’s development of the

ET tablets having a dimple mould and increased rate of dissolution may be
found in M.C. Addison and Metzger-Groom’s declarations and Metzger-
Groom’s January 1997 monthly report. Mr. Addison testiﬁes that he
supervised McGregor’s work, was well aware of his activities, and that he
contemporaneously signed the ROI and understood its signiﬁcance. (PX
1041). This is consistent with Metzger-Groom’s declaration and January
1997 monthly report which state that a procedure was developed with A. D.
McGregor to produce dimple tablets. (PX 1033, and PX 1034, ‘l[ 6).

e. Henkel’s Opposition to P&G’s Motion to Add
McGregor

Henkel presents numerous arguments in its opposition to adding
McGregor as an inventor. As explained below however, many of these

arguments are unrelated to the question of whether McGregor is a joint

3 Speciﬁc citations to the record for these findings may be found in the
preceding discussion regarding collaboration.

46




*** PAGE 47 ***


inventor.

i. Conception
Henkel Opposition 7 argues that:

McGregor’s alleged ROI neither demonstrates nor corroborates

that the alleged P&G inventors had conceived and reduced to

practice every limitation of any one of the three claims that in

the alternative deﬁne Count 2.

(Paper 100, p. 12). Henkel goes on to state that “[t]he alleged ROI does not
show that McGregor recognized every limitation of Count 2.”

Henkel’s arguments are not convincing. P&G’s motion requests that
McGregor be added as an inventor of the ‘564 patent. A person does not
need to reduce an invention to practice in order to be a joint inventor.
Further, joint inventorship requires a demonstration of a contribution to the
conception of the invention in a manner that was not insigniﬁcant in quality
as to a single claim and not a demonstration that the person to be added

conceived of every limitation of one of three claims of a Count, especially

where the Count includes claims from a third-party application.

ii. Authenticity & Corroboration

Henkel argues that the R01 is not properly authenticated. (Paper 100,
p. 14). Henkel argues that the signature of M. C. Addison on the ROI has
not been authenticated and there is “no indication that Addison witnessed the
document or understood its meaning and significance.” (Id.).

The Board’s rules provide that a party must file an objection within
ﬁve business days of service of the evidence. 37 C.F.R. § 41.155(b)(1). A

party who timely objected to the evidence must file a miscellaneous motion

47




*** PAGE 48 ***


to exclude to preserve its objection and the miscellaneous motion must
identify the objections in the record. 37 C.F.R. § 41.155 (c). Henkel did not
explain the timeliness of its objection nor ﬁle a miscellaneous motion to
exclude the disputed evidence. Accordingly, pursuant to the rules, we hold
that Henkel did not preserve its authenticity objection.

Additionally, P&G submitted a declaration from M. C. Addison that
authenticates the ROI. (PX 1041).4 Mr. Addison declares that he was
McGregor’s senior manager at the time and he “was well aware of the work
he [McGregor] was performing.” (Id. at ‘J[ 6). Mr. Addison declares that he
signed the ROI. (Id. at ‘][ 5). Mr. Addison further declares that “I did indeed
witness the ROI and understood its meaning and signiﬁcance.” (Id. at ‘][ 6).

Henkel argues that P&G has failed to offer proof to corroborate that
the work underlying the ROI was actually accomplished. (Paper 100, p. 14).
Joint inventorship focuses on a contribution to the conception of the
invention and does not require proof that experiments were conducted.

Here, Addison testifies that he witnessed the ROI and understood its
meaning and signiﬁcance. This testimony is consistent with the fact that
Addison was McGregor’s supervisor and that he was well aware of the work
McGregor was performing. Additional corroboration is provided by
Metzger-Groom’s January 1997 monthly report and her declaration, which
describe tablets made according to the method developed by McGregor. It is
also consistent with the February 14, 1997 patentability opinion prepared by

4 Henkel’s Request for Oral Argument (Paper 107) states that an issue
to be considered at the hearing was whether P&G exhibits 1040-1043 are
admissible noting that they were served with P&G Reply 5 rather than with
P&G’s case in chief. Henkel however, did not raise this issue at oral
argument. We do not exclude the exhibits as Henkel failed to fully develop
its objection to PX 1040-1043.

48




*** PAGE 49 ***


Claire Goodier, which was written to “M C Addison” and identiﬁes the ROI
(#2028) as McGregor’s. (PX 1030).

iii. Joint Inventorship

Henkel argues that McGregor, Speed and Painter are not joint
inventors of the ‘564 patent because P&G failed to demonstrate that Speed
and Painter contributed to the conception. (Paper 100, p. 15). For example,
Henkel states:

None of these vague references offer clear and convincing

proof of Speed’s signiﬁcant contribution to the alleged

conception of the invention.

(Id. at p. 16). Henkel also states ‘[t]he facts surrounding Painter’s
contribution to inventorship are even less credible.” (Id.). Henkel concludes
that there is no showing that McGregor, Speed and Painter collaborated on
the invention and if the ROI is relied upon for proof of conception then the
inventorship of the ‘564 patent is incorrect and invalid under 35 U.S.C.

§ 102(f). (Id. at 17-18).

P&G’s motion seeks to add McGregor as a joint inventor. Henkel
acknowledges that “[i]nventorship of an issued patent is presumed to be
correct.” (Id. at 15). Hence, there is a presumption that Speed and Painter
contributed to the conception of at least one claim of P&G’s ‘564 patent.
P&G was entitled to rely upon this presumption in support of its motion and
was not required to provide evidence to support the presumption. Further,
Henkel fails to identify sufﬁcient and credible evidence of record to rebut
the presumption that Speed and Painter provided a signiﬁcant contribution to
the conception of at least one claim of the patent.

Henkel alleges that P&G failed to demonstrate that McGregor

49




*** PAGE 50 ***


collaborated with the named inventors on the invention. We disagree. As
discussed in detail above, McGregor, Speed and Painter as well as Metzger-
Groom and Goodier were all on the same automatic dishwashing project
team at the Newcastle Technical Center. McGregor, Speed and Metzger-
Groom all testify that they met regularly as project team members and
discussed their data and results. Further, Speed and Painter both testify that
they were in communication with McGregor regarding the invention
described in the ROI prior to its drafting. Further evidence of collaboration
is provided by McGregor, Speed, and Metzger-Groom’s regular
communication with Goodier regarding the drafting of the patentability
opinions based on the ROI.
Henkel alleges that, if the ROI is relied upon for proof of conception

then McGregor, Speed and Painter cannot be joint inventors and the ‘564
patent is invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 102(f). We will note that “validity” is
not an issue in an interference. Rather, patentability is an issue. As stated
above, P&G was not required to provide evidence of Speed and Painter’s
contribution to conception of at least one claim. To the extent Henkel
wanted the Board to consider this issue, Henkel could have, but did not, ﬁle

a motion for unpatentability based upon § 102(f).

iv. Henkel Alleges McGregor’s ROI Fails to
Support a Reduction to Practice
Henkel Opposition 7 provides a long discussion of why McGregor’s
ROI did not establish an actual reduction to practice. For example, Henkel

states:

P&G has failed to prove that McGregor’s ROI establishes
reduction to practice of a P&G invention meeting all limitations

50




*** PAGE 51 ***


of Count 2 before P&G’s priority date of November 26, 1997,

which is the filing date of its U.S. Provisional patent

Application Serial No. 60/066,593 upon which the ‘564 patent

claims beneﬁt.

(Paper 100, p. 21).

P&G Motion 7 attempts to add McGregor as an inventor on the ‘564
patent. A person seeking to be named a joint inventor on a patent is not
required to demonstrate an actual reduction to practice, let alone an earlier
actual reduction to practice of a Count.

Inventorship is a question of law premised on underlying questions of
fact. Ethicon, 135 F.3d at 1460. We hold that P&G has provided clear and
sufficient evidence that McGregor collaborated with at least one named
inventor and contributed in a not insigniﬁcant manner to the conception of at
least one claim of the ‘564 patent. We further hold that his contribution is
corroborated by the evidence of record. We grant P&G Motion 7 to add

McGregor as an inventor of the ‘564 patent.

B. P&G Motion 5: Priority of Invention

P&G Motion 5 (Paper 93) moves for judgment on priority of
invention as against Henkel. Henkel opposes. (Paper 98).

A party may demonstrate that it was first to invent by establishing
either (1) an earlier date of reduction to practice, or (2) an earlier date of
conception, but a later date of reduction to practice, coupled with a
reasonable diligence to a reduction to practice from (a) a time prior to the
opponent’s conception until (b) the party’s reduction to practice is achieved.
Eaton v. Evans, 204 F.3d 1094, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Mahurkar v. C. R.
Bard, Inc., 79 F.3d 1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

51




*** PAGE 52 ***


Both parties have attempted to demonstrate that they were the first to
invent based upon an earlier date of actual reduction to practice and have not
relied upon diligence towards an actual reduction to practice.5 (Papers 92
and 93). Actual reduction to practice requires that an inventor demonstrate
that he contemporaneously appreciated an embodiment that met all the
limitations of the interference count. Cooper v. Goldfarb, 240 F.3d 1378,
1386 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit has held that Henkel proved a
corroborated appreciation by no than later May 1997. Henkel at 1376.
Accordingly, the critical date for P&G’s actual reduction to practice is no
later than May 1997.

1. Case Law on Actual Reduction to Practice
Whether an actual reduction to practice has been achieved is a

question of law which is resolved on the basis of underlying facts. Estee
Lauder, Inc. v. L'0real, S.A., 129 F.3d 588, 592 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
Speciﬁcally, in an interference proceeding, a party seeking to establish an
actual reduction to practice must satisfy a two-prong test: (1) the party
constructed an embodiment that met every limitation of the interference
count, and (2) the embodiment operated for its intended purpose. Eaton, 204
F.3d at 1097. As to the second prong, there must be some recognition of

5 Both Henkel’s and P&G’s Preliminary Statements allege diligence towards
a reduction to practice. (Henkel Papers 34 and 89, P&G, Paper 90).
Henkel’s Preliminary Statement alleges that an active diligence towards a
reduction to practice began March 6, 1997. (Paper 34, ‘][ 6). As neither
pa.rty’s motion for priority argued diligence, we find that the parties waived
this issue. (See, e.g., Henkel Motion 4, Paper 92, Conclusion, pages 23-24,
P&G Motion 4, Paper 93, Conclusion, p. 27). Furthermore, Henkel’s
alleged diligence is after P&G’s actual reduction to practice rendering the
issue moot.

52




*** PAGE 53 ***


successful testing prior to the critical date for an invention to be reduced to
practice. Thus, an actual reduction to practice “does not occur until an
inventor, or perhaps his agent, knows that the invention will work for its

intended purpose.” Estee Lauder, Inc., 129 F.3d at 593.

2. Count 2

Count 2 is the sole count in interference and includes three
alternatives, P&G ‘564 claim 1, Henkel ‘434 claim 41 and Henkel ‘578
claim 44. (Paper No. 87, ‘j[ 1).

Henkel ‘434 claim 41 requires a detergent tablet having a compressed
region and a solidified solution or melt region. The compressed region has a
recess and the dissolution rate of the compressed region is greater than the
dissolution rate of the solidiﬁed solution or melt region. The solution or
melt region is at least partially retained in the recess and is affixed to the
compressed region by hardening. The solution or melt region comprises no

more than 40% of the surface of the detergent tablet. (Decision - Rehearing,
Paper No. 86, ‘]I 8).

3. P&G Constructed Dimpled Tablets within the Scope of
Count 2
P&G contends that both McGregor and Metzger-Groom made tablets

falling within the scope of Count 2. Specifically, P&G alleges that
McGregor made the tablets described in his November 1997 ROI and that
Metzger-Groom made the tablets described in her January 1997 monthly
report. (Paper 93, p. 14). As to recognizing the utility of the invention,
P&G directs the Board’s attention to Metzger-Groom’s testing of the dimple

tablet described in her January 1997 monthly report. Hence, our focus for

53




*** PAGE 54 ***


actual reduction to practice is on Metzger-Groom’s making and testing of
the tablet and the inventor’s purported appreciation that the invention
worked for its intended purpose. Yet, to place Metzger-Groom’s monthly
report in context, we first look at the evidence that describes the work
leading up to her report.

Beginning in April 1996, McGregor’s monthly reports describe his
ideas on increasing the dissolution rate of phosphate tablets. (PX 1023).
The April report identiﬁes three potential ways of increasing the dissolution:
1) increase the hydration state of the phosphate; 2) incorporating a
disintegrant into the phosphate matrix; and 3) contouring the tablet surface.
(Id.). The report goes on to state that contouring the surface can be achieved
using dirnpled punch heads and that they are preparing a tablet punch head
for development work. (Id.).

McGregor’s May 1996 report states that the key lead for improving
the dissolution rate of the tablets was to increase the hydration state of the
phosphate. (PX 1024). The report provides a table describing what appears
to be several tests balancing the tabletting pressure and the hydration state of
the phosphate and measuring total dissolution rate. (Id.). The report also
states that process trials have been completed with acceptance testing of a
tablet press with the testing demonstrating that the press was well capable of
meeting the project success criteria for tablet weight and hardness. (Id.).

McGregor’s November 1996 report states that:

The European Tablet (ET) now dissolves at a sufﬁcient rate into
the wash so as to meet the project performance criteria.
Increased phosphate hexa-hydrate conversion and reduced
hardness have achieved this increase in dissolution rate.

(PX 1025).

54




*** PAGE 55 ***


McGregor, Speed and Painter were all working on the same automatic
dishwashing project team at the same facility. All three of them testify that,
prior to the date of McGregor’s ROI, Speed and Painter shared their
perspectives on the release of actives from a tablet. (PX 1028, ‘JI ll, PX
1035, ‘ll 5, PX 1036, ‘j[ 4). In particular, McGregor and Painter testify that
McGregor asked Painter about materials that would start to melt/dissolve at
various temperatures and that Painter shared his perspective on the use of
PEG and NB-base in the tablet. (PX 1028, 11 11, PX 1036, ‘II 4).

McGregor’s ROI has a typewritten date of November 22, 1996 and
has a received stamp of November 29, 1996 in the upper right hand corner.
(PX 1009, p. 1). The ROI provides a descriptive title that refers to djmpled
tablets for delivering raw materials via an inert carrier to maintain the raw
material activity. (Id.). The ROI states that highly active ingredients, e.g.,
NB-base, can retain their activity by using a dimple approach or spray-on
approach. (Id. at 2-3). The dimple approach is described as a tablet having
a concave face or multiple dimples. A reactive molten mix of reactive
material and inert carrier is dropped onto the concave surface of the tablet
and allowed to cool or a solid mix is pressed into the concave surface of the
tablet. (Id. at 2). The ROI states that the inert carrier is chosen carefully so
that it only starts to melt/dissolve at a particular temperature in the wash
cycle. (Id. at 3).

The ROI provides three specific examples of dirnpled tablets and their
method of manufacture. (Id. at 5-8). The three tablets comprise a
compressed region (tabletted granules) and a solidified melt region (PEG
heated until molten, mixed with an active, and dropped into the tablet

dimple). The major component of the compressed region in each tablet is
12% moisture phosphate (i.e., hydrated phosphate). (Id.). The ROI provides

55




*** PAGE 56 ***


a detailed schematic for the ET tabletting process. The “ET Dimpled
Tablet” formed by the process has a diameter of 32 mm and a height of 13.4
mm. (Id. at 8, upper right hand comer of schematic). The upper surface of
the compressed region contains a concavity, i.e., dimple. The concavity is
formed with an upper tablet punch that can be 10 mm or 20 mm in diameter.
(Id. at 5-7). The ROI states that, in November 1996, initial laboratory scale
work was carried out to identify a suitable carrier, i.e., PEG 10,000, and
performance benefits. (Id. at 9).

The tablets in McGregor’s ROI fall within the scope of Count 2. For
reasons of convenience, we compare the detergent tablets described in
McGregor’s ROI with the limitations presented in Henkel ‘434 claim 41,
which forms a part of Count 2.

McGregor’s ROI exempliﬁed detergent tablets have a “compressed
region.” Specifically, the compressed region comprises granules having
12% moisture phosphate that are “tabletted @ 7 tonf to a hardness of 21kg.”
(PX 1009, Examples 1-3, pages 5-7).

The ROI detergent tablets have a “solidified solution or melt region.”
Specifically, the ROI detergent tablets can be prepared using a “molten mix
of reactive raw material and inert carrier [that] is dropped onto the surface of
the tablet and allowed to cool.” (PX 1009, p. 2). R01 Examples 1-3 all
describe heating a PEG (polyethylene glycol) polymer until molten, mixing
it with a detergent active and then dropping the liquid mix into the tablet
dimple. (PX 1009, Examples 1-3, pages 5-7).

The compressed region of the exemplified ROI detergent tablets
contains “a recess.” The ROI states that the surface of the tablet, which is
the compressed region, can be tabletted with a concave face “dimple.” (Id.
at 2). R01 Examples 1-3 all describe the use of an upper punch to create a

56




*** PAGE 57 ***


hemispherical dimple. (Id. at pages 5-7). Fmther, the ROI schematic
diagram of the automatic dishwashing ET tabletting process depicts an ET
dimpled tablet having a recess on its upper surface. (Id. at p. 8).

The exempliﬁed ROI detergent tablets have a dissolution rate of the
compressed region that is greater than the dissolution rate of the melt region.
This property is demonstrated by Metzger-Groom’s testing of a tablet made
according to the ROI and confirmed by the testimony of David Smith, who
has a Bachelor’s degree with honors in Chemical Engineering. (PX 1029, ‘l[
4). Mr. Smith testiﬁes that he is a person of ordinary skill in the art and that
the tablets exempliﬁed in McGregor’s ROI provide “a physical embodiment
that meets all the claim limitations of the claims encompassing Count 2.”
(Id. at ‘J[‘][ 4 and 9). We credit Smith’s testimony, for as explained below, it is
consistent with the contents of the ROI.

Mr. Smith testifies that during the course of the interference he, with
his assistant, essentially reproduced a dimpled detergent tablet according to
Example 2 of the ROI. (PX 1029, ‘][ 9). Specifically, Mr. Smith’s dimpled
tablets are said to be identical to those of ROI Example 2 except for minor
substitutions in the compressed region components that do not materially
affect the dissolution rate of the dimpled tablet or the compressed region of
the tablet. (Id. at ‘][ 10). Mr. Smith testifies that the dimpled tablet exhibited
a dissolution rate of 0.28 g/min for the compressed region and 0.21 g/min for
the solidiﬁed solution or melt region. (Id. at ‘J[ 9). Based upon these results,
Mr. Smith concluded that the compressed region of the tablet dissolved at a
faster rate than the non-compressed portion. (Id.). We give Mr. Smith’s
testimony no weight as to the question of whether the inventors’ conceived
of this tablet property or contemporaneously appreciated this property.
Instead we rely upon Mr. Smith’s testing and testimony solely to

57




*** PAGE 58 ***


demonstrate that post-filing testing was not inconsistent with P&G’s
contemporaneous testing and appreciation, which is discussed later in this
opinion.

The exemplified ROI detergent tablets are made by delivering a melt
into the recess on the surface of the compressed region and are partially
retained in this recess. In particular, the exemplified tablets are made by
1) heating the PEG until molten, 2) mixing the molten PEG with an active
and, 3) dropping the liquid mix into the tablet dimple. (PX 1009, Examples
1-3, pages 5-7). Further, the schematic blockﬂow diagram of the ET
tabletting process depicts the solidiﬁed melt as retained in the dimple. (Id. at
p. 8).

The exempliﬁed ROI detergent tablets have a solidified solution or
melt region afﬁxed to the compressed region by hardening. The ROI’s
molten PEG mixture is dropped into the dimple on the surface of the
compressed region of the tablet. One of ordinary skill in the art would
understand that the PEG mixture, upon cooling, is affixed to the compressed
region by hardening. (PX 1029, ‘II 13, p. 11).

The exempliﬁed ROI detergent tablets have a solidiﬁed solution or
melt region that comprises no more than 40% of the surface of the detergent
tablet. The ROI identiﬁes the dimensions of the exemplified tablets,
specifically the diameter of the tablets, the diameter of the concavity and the
height of the tablets. (Id. at Examples 1-3 and Schematic, pages 5-8). Even
a cursory review of the depicted tablet below, which appears on page 8 of
the schematic, demonstrates that the solidiﬁed melt in the concavity of the

compressed region will be well below the 40% level required by the Count.

58

Further, Mr. Smith conﬁrms what is clear to the casual observer and
calculates the surface area of the solidiﬁed melt tablet depicted above as
only 8.7% of the surface area of the entire tablet. (PX 1029, ‘]I 13, p. 11).
Thus, McGregor’s dimple tablets were specifically designed with a melt
region having a surface area well below the 40% recited in the count.

Metzger-Groom testifies that the dimple tablets she made, and
described in her Januaiy 1997 report, were made according to the method
developed by McGregor as detailed in McGregor’s ROI. (PX 1034, ‘H 6).
Her testimony is consistent with the descriptions provided in her January
1997 report, which itself is consistent with the dimple tablets described in
McGregor’s ROI. We credit Metzger-Groom’s testimony and find that the
dimple tablets described in her monthly report were made according to the
procedure described in McGregor’s ROI.

Metzger-Groom’s dimple tablets, like the ROI tablets, fall within the
scope of Count 2. Specifically, Metzger-Groom’s dimple tablets were made
according to the procedure described in the ROI. For example, Metzger-
Groom’s dimple tablets use PEG 3000 and NB-base “to fill the dimple,”

which is consistent with the examples and schematic of the ROI where the

59




*** PAGE 60 ***


compressed regions concavity (“dimple”) is filled with a molten mixture of
PEG and an active ingredient. (Compare PX 1033, PX 1034, ‘][ 6 and PX
1009, Examples 1-3 and schematic). We find that Metzger-Groom’s dimple
tablets fall within the scope of Count 2, for the reasons explained above with
respect to the ROI dimple tablets and in View of Metzger-Groom’s testimony
and report identifying that the dimple tablets were made according to
McGregor’s ROI where PEG 3000 was melted together with NB-base
particles to fill the dimple.

We ﬁnd that P&G has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate by
at least a preponderance of the evidence that the dimpled tablets described in
Metzger-Groom’s January 1997 report constitute an embodiment within the

scope of Count 2.

3. P&G Tested the Dimpled Tablets and McGregor and/or
Speed Appreciated that the Invention Worked for its
Intended Purpose

Metzger-Groom’s January 1, 1997 report states that the dimple tablets
are storage stable. Additionally, the report states that the performance of the
dimple tablet is slightly worse than regular tablets, i.e., 61% carotenoid stain
removal for ET tablet with dimple versus 65-68% for regular ET tablets.
The report states that the reduced performance may stem from the “slower
release of NB-base from the dimple vs. regular tablets.” The report
identifies potential future designs of the tablet as including lower molecular
weight PEG to release the active in the melt region dimple faster than the
actives in the compressed region of the tablet.

Metzger-Groom testiﬁes that the dimple table in her report was made
according to the “method developed by Alasdair McGregor as detailed in the

60




*** PAGE 61 ***


ROI (Ex. 1009).” (PX 1034, ‘j[ 6). Metzger-Groom confirmed that the
dimple tablet of her report achieved success by demonstrating a 61%
carotenoid stain removal. (Id.).

Metzger-Groom testifies that, as required by management, it was her
standard practice to publish her monthly report within at least one week after
the end of the month. (Id. at ‘]I 5). She testifies that, based on her customary
practice, she likely published her report by January 7, 1997. (Id.). Further,
Metzger-Groom testifies that Speed was her manager at the time she
conducted the work and that she reported the data of the subject monthly
directly to Speed after generating the data. (Id.). Metzger-Groom also
testifies that she, Speed and McGregor were on the same project team and
“met often discussing our data and results on a regular basis, if not at least a
weekly basis.” (Id.).

McGregor testifies that, by at least early January 1997, he appreciated
that a detergent tablet made according to the procedure described in his ROI
worked for its intended purpose as evidenced by Metzger-Groom’s monthly
report. (PX 1028, ‘]I 14). McGregor testifies that he recalls reading the
report at least in early January 1997 based on his standard practice of
reading monthly reports of his project team members shortly after they are
published. (Id.). McGregor also testifies that by February 14, 1997 he fully
appreciated that the use of PEG 3,000 (which was used in Metzger-Groom’s
tablets) equates to a slower dissolution rate for the non-compressed region of
his tablets. (PX 1042, ‘J[ 8).

We credit McGregor’s testimony regarding appreciation as it is
sufficiently corroborated by, and consistent with, the evidence of record.
For example, Metzger-Groom’s monthly report identifies the tested tablets

as successfully removing carotenoid stains and as having a slower

61




*** PAGE 62 ***


dissolution rate for the non-compressed region (dimple) as opposed to the
compressed region. Metzger-Groom testiﬁes that, as project team members
working on the same project in the same facility, she met often with
McGregor to discuss data and results. Further corroboration is provided by
Claire Goodier who testiﬁes that she met with McGregor, Speed and
Metzger-Groom before issuing her February 14, 1997 patentability opinion
and that before this date it was well established that the dissolution rate of
the non-compressed region is decreased by the use of PEG. (PX 1032, ‘]I 6).

4. Henkel’s Opposition

Henkel opposes P&G motion for priority alleging that P&G has failed
to prove conception and reduction to practice earlier than P&G’ s
constructive reduction to practice date of November 26, 1997. (Henkel
Opposition 5, Paper 98, p. 14). Henke1’s opposition is limited to contesting
P&G’s conception and contemporaneous appreciation of the dissolution rate
limitation of Count 2. Indeed, Henkel Opposition 5 provides an Appendix A
listing the requirements of each alternative embodiment of the Count and
objects only to the dissolution rate limitation. (Id. at Appendix A). For
example, Henkel’s opposition with respect to ‘434 claim 41, which is an

embodiment of Count 2, is reproduced below:

(Id.). Henkel’s opposition arguments are considered below.

a. The ROI

Henkel argues that McGregor’s ROI fails to demonstrate that P&G’s
inventors had conceived and reduced to practice every limitation of any one
of the three claims that, in the alternative, define Count 2. (Id. at 15).
Henkel’s argument is moot as we don’t rely upon McGregor’s R01 to
demonstrate a complete conception of an embodiment within the scope of
the Count or to prove that McGregor made the tablets reported in the ROI.

Henkel argues that McGregor’s R01 is inadmissible for lack of
authenticity. (Id. at 16). As discussed above, Henkel did not preserve its
objection to the authenticity of the ROI. 37 C.F.R. § 41.155(c).
Additionally, the testimony of Addison authenticates the ROI. (PX 1041, ‘]I
‘j[ 5, 6).

Henkel argues that McGregor’s ROI lacks corroboration. (Paper 98,
p. 16). In particular, Henkel argues that P&G offers no proof to corroborate
that the work underlying the alleged ROI was actually accomplished and that
the statements in the R01 are suspect since McGregor’s notebooks are lost.

*** PAGE 64 ***


(Id. at 17). We have not relied upon the R01 to prove that the work recited
therein was actually conducted. Rather, we have relied upon the ROI as
describing dimple tablets and describing a method of manufacturing the
dimple tablets. However, to the extent corroboration of the work reported in
the R01 is necessary, we identify Mr. Addison as providing credible
testimony that, as McGregor’s supervisor, he was well aware of the work
that McGregor was performing and that he witnessed the ROI and
understood its meaning and signiﬁcance. (PX 1041, HI ‘J[ 5, 6).

Henkel argues that McGregor, Speed and Painter are not joint
inventors as Speed and Painter did not participate in the alleged conception.
(Paper 98, p. 17-20). In particular, Henkel takes the position that if the ROI
is relied upon for proof of conception then McGregor, Speed and Painter

carmot be joint inventors and the ‘564 patent is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.

§102(f). (Id. at 20). Henkel’s position does not add up to a convincing
argument. Joint inventorship can be established by a demonstration of a
contribution to the conception of the invention in a manner that was not
insigniﬁcant in quality as to a single claim of the patent. The issue raised by
P&G Motion 5 is priority of invention as to the Count. Additionally, as
noted earlier, Henkel could have, but did not, file a motion for
unpatentability based upon § 102(f) where it would have had the burden of
coming forward with evidence to rebut the presumption that Speed and
Painter contributed to the conception of at least one claim of the patent.
Henkel argues that the ROI does not support a reduction to practice of
the invention. (Id.). For example, Henkel argues that the ROI Example 2
offers no indication that the measurement of the dissolution rate was
attempted. (Id. at 21). The Count however, does not require a measurement

of speciﬁc dissolution rates. Henkel Corp. at 1374 (“The correct

64




*** PAGE 65 ***


requirement of the count calls for a showing of an appreciation by the
inventors simply that the dissolution rate of the compressed region is greater
than the dissolution rate of the other region.”). Further, as discussed above,
we have not relied upon the ROI as proof that the work recited therein was

actually conducted.

b. Metzger-Groom’s Report
Henkel argues that the Metzger-Groom January 1997 monthly report
(PX 1033) fails to establish a reduction to practice as “no alleged P&G
inventor recognized all limitations of Count 2.” (Id. at 22). Henkel goes on
to state:

At least as reported (P&G once again did not produce

contemporaneous documentation in the form of Metzger-

Groom’s laboratory notebooks), Metzger-Groom did not

determine the dissolution rates of the tablet by the so-called

SOTAX method or any equivalent. Moreover, Metzger-Groom

does not state that she appreciated the limitation in the

invention of differential dissolution rate (see Ex. 1034), so any

arguments P&G might make regarding inurement of the

invention to the beneﬁt of the alleged inventors would likewise

fail.

(Id.).

Contrary to Henkel’s arguments, the Count does not require a
determination of the speciﬁc dissolution rates of the tablet. Instead, the
Count merely requires a showing that an inventor appreciated that the
dissolution rate of the compressed region is greater than the other region.
Henkel is correct however, that Metzger-Groom does not explicitly aver that
she or the inventors appreciated the speciﬁc dissolution rate limitation at the

time of her experiment but such a formulaic afﬁrmation is unnecessary

65




*** PAGE 66 ***


under the facts of this case. This is not a case where there is a signiﬁcant
danger that the inventors accidentally created something new; rather, they
set out to design detergent tablets having a particular structure and
composition and did so. The only question is whether they appreciated the
discernible property that was observed and reported by their fellow project
team member in her monthly report. Speciﬁcally, the dissolution rate
limitation is a discernible property of the invention that was directly
observed and reported in Metzger-Groom’s January 1997 report. (PX 1033).
Metzger-Groom worked under the supervision of one of the inventors,
Speed, and testiﬁes that she was in regular communication regarding her
data and results with both Speed and McGregor. Further, McGregor testiﬁes
that, by at least February 14, 1997, he appreciated that use of PEG 3,000
(which was used in Metzger-Groom’s tablets) equates to a slower
dissolution rate for the non—compressed region of his tablets. McGregor’ s
testimony is consistent with Metzger-Groom’s testimony and monthly report
as well as the testimony of Claire Goodier who testiﬁes that she met with
McGregor, Speed and Metzger-Groom before issuing her February 14, 1997
patentability opinion and that before this date it was well established that the
dissolution rate of the non-compressed region is decreased by the use of
PEG. (PX 1032, ‘j[ 6). To require more speciﬁc declarations than P&G has
proffered would be in contravention of the Federal Circuit’s holding in
Mycogen that an inventor can appreciate an embodiment within the scope of
a count without enunciating the precise language of the count. Mycogen,
243 F.3d at 1336.
Henkel directs our attention to the stated purposes of Metzger-

Groom’s dimple tablet experiments, which were to improve the stability and

rate of delivery of Tergitol and to improve the stability of NB-base in

66




*** PAGE 67 ***


tablets. (Paper 98, pages 22-23). Henkel also directs our attention to the
statements in the report that the hypothesis that the early release of NB-base
is critical to performance is being investigated and that such early release
may be obtained by using lower molecular weight PEG. Henkel states that
these statements in the monthly report teach away “in the strongest possible
terms” from P&G’s inventors’ appreciation of the required dissolution rate.
(Id. at 23).

Henkel is correct that the stated purpose of the test was not to
determine the dissolution rates of the compressed and non-compressed
regions. Again, this is not a case where there is a significant danger that the
inventors accidentally created something new; rather, they set out to design
detergent tablets where the structure and composition of the tablet were
designed to control the dissolution of the inert carrier and actives in the non-
compressed region as compared to the compressed region. As such, the
reported “purpose” of the test does not detract from the ROI’s statements
that a PEG carrier is selected to control the dissolution of the dimple or the
observation in Metzger-Groom’s monthly report regarding a slower release
of NB-base in the dimple versus a regular tablet.

Henkel is incorrect in suggesting that the monthly report’s statement
of future efforts teaches away from the inventors’ appreciation of the
dissolution rate limitation. Instead, it teaches the opposite. Specifically, the
monthly report hypothesizes that stain removal could be improved by a
faster release, i.e., faster dissolution rate, for the non-compressed dimple
portion of the tablet. The monthly report states that a lower molecular
weight PEG could be used to ensure that the NB-base is quickly released and
identifies a system using low molecular weight PEG in combination with a

fizzy matrix to control the release of the NB-base prior to the release of

67




*** PAGE 68 ***


components from the compressed region. This is entirely consistent with the
reported observation that the NB-base in the noncompressed portion of the
tested tablet dissolved slower than the NB-base in the regular compressed
portion of the tablet. Further, the fact that a product can be improved upon
does not mean that the product is a failure. For instance, as both parties are
aware, P&G’s Tide® brand of detergent is useful in cleaning clothes but it
has consistently been updated and improved upon over the years.

Henkel contends that P&G seeks to establish a reduction to practice
nunc pro tunc. (Paper 98, p. 23). As discussed above, P&G’s testing and
appreciation of an embodiment within the scope of Count 2 was prior to
Henkel’s critical date and does not involve a nunc pro tunc reduction to
practice.

Additionally, Henkel states that it was unable to decipher Metzger-
Groom’s report stating, for example, “no description of an ‘ET’ tablet is
offered.” (Paper 98, p. 22). The report however, states that the dimple
tablets were made according to the procedure developed with McGregor.
Likewise, Metzger-Groom testified that the dimple tablets were made
according to the method described in McGregor’s ROI. (PX 1034, ‘]I 6).
McGregor’s ROI provides a detailed schematic for the “ADW (ET)
Tabletting Process” and McGregor’s November 1996 monthly report refers
to the “European Tablet (ET).” (PX 1009, p. 8 and PX 1025). Based upon
the evidence of record, we find that Henkel has failed to establish that one of
ordinary skill in the art would have been unable to decipher Metzger-
Groom’s monthly report.

We hold that P&G has demonstrated at least one of its inventors
appreciated that an embodiment of the count worked for its intended purpose

by no later than February 14, 1997. We grant P&G Motion 5 and hold that

68




*** PAGE 69 ***


P&G’s actual reduction to practice date is February 14, 1997, which is prior
to Henkel’s actual reduction to practice date of no later than May 1997.
Priority of invention is awarded against Henkel.

It is:

Ordered that P&G Miscellaneous Motion 7 (Paper 94) for correction
of inventorship is granted.

Further Ordered that P&G Substantive Motion 5 (Paper 93) for
judgment on priority of invention as to Count 2, the sole count in

interference, is granted.
