Appeal No. 95-4513
Application O8/261,667

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request that we reconsider our decision mailed

OI]

September 25, 1998 wherein we affirmed the rejection of claims
1-6 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over Koboshi.

Appellants argue (request, page 1) that they find in the
record no concession that “[t]here is no dispute as to whether
Koboshi discloses developing step (a) in appellants’ claim 1"
as stated on page 4 of our decision. Appellants did not argue
in their briefs that Koboshi does not disclose step (a) of
their claim 1 and do not make that argument in their request
for rehearing.

Appellants argue that Koboshi teaches that image
amplification should not be used with a bleaching step
(request, page 1). In support of this argument, appellants
rely upon the portion of Koboshi which states: “To wit, the
inventors have found that the bleaching of silver with
hydrogen peroxide can not take place within the region in

which the image is amplified, and that it can only take place

by using the above—mentioned bath which is so adjusted in a
region which is different than the above—mentioned region in
which the image is amplified" (col. 3, lines 62-68). The
compounds which Koboshi adds to the bath to carry out this
adjustment, appellants argue, would materially affect the

basic and novel characteristics of appellants’ method

and therefore are excluded by the term “consisting essentially
of" in step (b) of appellants’ claim 1 (request, pages l—2).
Appellants have not stated on the record what they
consider to be the basic and novel characteristics of their
method. Our decision (page 5) includes a finding as to what
the basic and novel characteristics of appellants’ claimed
method are, and in appellants’ request for rehearing, they do
not contest this finding. We remain of the view that for the
reasons given in our decision (pages 5-6), the compounds which
Koboshi adds to his bath would not materially affect the basic
and novel characteristics of appellants’ claimed method.
Appellants argue that their method has the advantage of
permitting the use of a common storage facility for hydrogen

peroxide used in the amplification solution and the bleaching

solution (request, page 2). As stated in our decision (page
5), the hydrogen peroxide used in Koboshi’s bleaching solution
could be stored in the same container as hydrogen peroxide
used in an amplification solution.

Appellants argue that in our decision, we focused only on
step (b) of their method (request, page 2). As discussed
above, appellants have not argued that Koboshi does not
disclose step (a) of their method.

We have considered appellants’ request for rehearing but,
for the reasons given above, decline to make any change to our
decision.
