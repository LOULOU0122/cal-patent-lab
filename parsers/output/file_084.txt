Appeal No. 2002-0013
Application No. 08/839,883

ORDER REMANDING TO EXAMINER

Appellants filed the following amendments to claim 1 on
appeal:

0 November 12, 1998 (Paper No. 5)

0 August 9, 1999 (Paper No. 10)

0 November 26, 1999 (Paper No. 12).

Subsequently, appellants filed an Appeal Brief on
December 28, 2000 (Paper No. 17). According to the Examiner's
Answer entered February 13, 2001 (Paper No. 18), the examiner
states on page 3, section (8) that "[t]he copy of the appealed

claims contained in the Appendix to the brief is correct."

Appeal No. 2002-0013
Application No. 08/839,883

However, a review of the Appendix to the Brief reveals that

claim 1 is not the correct copy according to the amendments filed
on August 8, 1999 (Paper No. 10) and November 26, 1999 (Paper

No. 12). Claim, lines 7 and 8, contains substantial errors as
follows:

Line 7: After data, enter "——which has already been
transmitted, after——."

Line 7: Delete "——when——."

Line 7: Delete "different" and replace with
"——requested——."

Line 7: After "information" add "——, which is different
from said advertising data——."

Lige_8: After "out" add "——during a time when the requested
information is being transmitted, this time being different from
said communication idle time and——."

Accordingly, it is

ORDERED that the application is remanded to the
examiner for notifying appellants to submit a corrected Appendix
to the Brief, or for the examiner to submit a correct copy of
claim 1 on appeal, and for such further action as may be
appropriate.

It is important that the Board of Patent Appeals and
Interferences be informed promptly of any action affecting the

status of the appeal (i.e., abandonment, issue, reopening

prosecution).
