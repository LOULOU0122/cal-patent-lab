REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Pursuant to the provisions of 37 CFR § l.197(b) (1997), appellants have

submitted a timely Request for Rehearing (hereafter "Request") of our Decision dated

October 31, 2002, aflirming the rejection of claims 1, 7, 9 through 1 l, 17 and 18

under the judicially created doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting as being
unpatentable over claim 1 of U. 5. Patent 5,487,845.

Appellants request rehearing as the Board has denied consideration of appellants’
declaration under 37 CFR § 1.132. in support of this conclusion, the Board stated that:

in a rejection on the grounds of obviousness-type double patenting an
afﬁdavit under 37 CFR § 1.132 is ineffective to overcome the rejection
except in the instance wherein, the prior art effect of the ﬁrst patent may be
avoided by a showing under 37 CFR § 1.132 that any unclaimed invention
disclosed in the ﬁrst patent was derived from the inventor of the application
before the examiner in which the 35 U.S.C. §§102(e)/ 1 03 (a) rejection
was made. in re Katz 687 F.2d 4-50, 215 USPQ 14- (CCPA 1982). Such

in not the case on the record before us. [Decision, pp. 6-7.]

 

Upon careful reconsideration, we ﬁnd that our reviewing court in at least one
instance has reviewed and considered a Declaration purporting to show unexpected results
to overcome a rejection on the grounds of obviousness-type double patenting. Our
reviewing court considered the Declaration and found that it failed to provide the
unexpected results necessary to rebut the mil @ case of obviousness. E Ii
Q,-gj, 759 F.2d 887, 896-97, 225 USPQ 645, 651-52 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
Accordingly, we hold that under appropriate circumstances a declaration under 37 CFR §
1.132 submitted as a rebuttal to a sustainable rejection on the grounds of obviousness-
type double patenting must be considered.

In rebuttal to our conclusion that the claimed subject matter was an obvious

variation of the invention deﬁned in the claims of the 5,487,845 patent and accordingly,

continued protection improperly beyond the date of expiration of the ﬁrst patent, the
appellants request consideration of the Declaration of Plach. it is the appellants’ position
that, ”the mixtures containing the compounds in accordance with the invention have
substantially improved threshold voltages, that is, lower in all cases than the prior art
Example 1.” See Request, p. 5.

Having reviewed the data present, we conclude that the appellants have not met
their burden of showing unexpected results. in re Klosak, 455 F.2d 1077, 1080, 173
USPQ 14, 16 (CCPA 1972). it is not sufﬁcient to assert that the results obtained are
unusual or unexpected. The burden of showing unexpected results rests on those who
assert them.

Upon consideration of the data before us, the Declaration is directed to four
examples containing liquid crystalline compositions, each composition containing a base
mixture of six compounds designated in the Plach Declaration on page 4. With respect to
each of the Examples l to IV, the declarant has measured the clearing points, An and the
threshold voltages V00, 0' 20, and V9010, 20,. it is the appellants’ position that the threshold
voltages of the invention are substantially improved over the prior art voltages. See
Examples ll, ill, and IV wherein the threshold voltages are lower in all cases than that of
prior art Example I. We ﬁnd that the threshold voltages, V00, 0' 20,, in Examples l to IV are
1.56, 1.47, 1.50 and 1.49 respectively. We ﬁnd that the threshold voltages are indeed

lower in Examples ll, ill and IV, the amount of lowering being between 0.06 and 0.09

Application No. 08/225,267

Volts for V0010, 20, and between 0.07 and 0.10 volts for V9010, 20,. There is, however, no
explanation by the declarant why a change lowering the threshold voltage of at most 0.10
volts is signiﬁcant, let alone establishes unusual or unexpected results.

Signiﬁcantly, the appellants, in describing their invention, disclose that, "[t]he
threshold voltages V0010, 20, achieved are generally s 1.8 volts, preferably 3 1.6 volts and
particularly preferably in the range from 1.4 to 1.6 volts, or lower.” See Speciﬁcation,

p. 10, lines 14-17. We, accordingly, conclude that the threshold voltage of Example 1,
representative of the prior art falls within the appellants’ most preferable threshold voltage
range. Furthermore, in the mixture examples present in the Speciﬁcation, only Example A
teaches threshold voltages. The threshold voltages recorded therein are Va‘, 0, 20, = 1.63
and V90, 0' 20, = 2.58. These numbers within the scope of the claimed subject matter far
exceed any of the threshold voltages measured in any of the examples in the Declaration of
Plach.

Based upon the above ﬁndings and analysis, we conclude that the appellants’
assertion that they have obtained substantially improved threshold voltages is unsupported
by the evidence of record and in conﬁict with the teachings found in the Speciﬁcation.

As to the Plach Declaration, we further conclude that the data present in the
Declaration are not commensurate in scope with the degree of protection sought by the
claimed subject matter. Si in re Grasselli, 713 F.2d 731, 743, 218 USPQ 769, 778-

79(Fed. Cir. 1983); ln re Tifﬁn, 448 F.2d 791, 792, 171 USPQ 294, 294 (CCPA

1971). it is well settled that "objective evidence of nonobviousness must be
commensurate in scope with the claims . . . ." (quoting in re Lindner, 457 F.2d 506,
508, 173 USPQ 356, 358 (CCPA 1972)). In re Dill, 604 F.2d 1356, 1361,
202 USPQ 805, 808 (CCPA 1979) ("The evidence presented to rebut a prima facie
case of obviousness must be commensurate in scope with the claims to which it pertains.")

The comparison present in the Declaration is directed to four examples containing
a mixture of 9 to 10 liquid crystal compounds. As the declarant has stated ,

some of the most important requirements to be met by
technically and commercially usable liquid crystalline
mixtures exhibiting a positive dielectric anisotropy for
active matrix liquid-crystal displays are the following:

(a) a broad temperature range of nematic liquid crystalline
mesophase,

(b) a low viscosity which is important for achieving a
short response time,

© a high dielectric anisotropy which is important in
achieving a low threshold voltage,

(d) high values of the voltage holding ratio (HR) even
after high temperature treatment;

THAT until now no single compound has been found
which fulﬁlls all of these requirements; thus , liquid
crystalline dielectrics for electrooptical displays usually

are mixtures of at least three liquid crystalline components,
while technically and commercially used high performance
liquid crystalline dielectrics contain ﬁve to more than ten
such compounds; [Plach Declaration, p. 2.]

Application No. 08/225,267

As each of the examples in the Declaration contain nine or ten components, and
being cognizant of the appellants statement that mixtures of at least three components are
needed to meet the requirements of the invention, we conclude that a showing of nine or
ten mixed components are not commensurate in scope with the claimed subject matter,
which requires no more than, "a mixture of polar compounds.” See claim 1.

Moreover, as declarant Plach has stated with respect to the above-described
properties that, "each compound exerts an inﬂuence on more than one of the above
mentioned properties; . . . ." and that no single compound fulﬁlls each of these
requirements, how can a single base mixture containing a mixture of 10 compounds be
representative of the prior art as a whole or commensurate in scope with a claim requiring
only two compounds, i.e. , " a mixture.” See the Plach Declaration, p. 2.

Finally, the appellants have argued that, "Example ii is directly comparative with
Example I, but the cyclohexylene compounds have been replaced by the same amount of
the two cyclohexenylene compounds in accordance with the invention.” See Brief, p. 10.
Although the appellants allege that Examples l and ii of the Plach Declaration are a side-by-
side comparison between the claimed invention and the closest prior art, we find that the
declarant has not shown that other than the unsaturation present in the ring, the
compounds are otherwise identical in all respects. Neither the appellants nor the declarant
have explained the acronyms presented with respect to each of the compounds listed as

numbers 1 through 8. See the Plach Declaration, pp. 3 and 4. What is the meaning of 3

F.F.F, 5F.F.F, 2-F, 3-F, 5-F and 3-OD? in their absence we cannot determine which
moieties are present on each of compounds 1 through 8. Accordingly, we conclude that
there is no appropriate side-by-side comparison between the claimed invention and the
closest prior art.

Based on our consideration of the totality of the record before us, and having
evaluated the i E case of obviousness in view of the appellants’ arguments and
evidence, we conclude that the preponderance of evidence weighs in favor of obviousness

of the claimed subject matter within the meaning of Section 103. Sie in re Oetlker 977

 

F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
in view of the foregoing, the appellants’ Request for Reconsideration has been
granted to the extent of considering the Declaration of Plach of record, but is denied with

respect to making any changes in our prior decision.
