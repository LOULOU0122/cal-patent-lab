VACATUR AND REMAND

WILLIAM F. SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

This appeal involves plant patent Application No. 09/939,491. The question
raised in this appeal involves whether evidence of toreign sales of the claimed
reproducible plant variety may enable an otherwise non-enabled printed publication
disclosing the plant, thereby creating a bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). The Court of
Appeals tor the Federal Circuit considered that issue in In re Eisner, 381 F.3d 1125,

72 USPQ2d 1038 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and held in the aftirmative. L; at 1128, 72 USPQ2d

at 1041. In so holding, the court stated that “[t]he foreign sale must not be an

obscure, solitary occurrence that would go unnoticed by those skilled in the art." |_d_. at
1131, 72 USPQ2d at 1043. The court also stated that the record did not establish that
“even if the interested public would readily know of the foreign sales, those sales
enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to reproduce the claimed plants without undue
experimentation.” Q Thus, the court vacated the Board’s decision and remanded the
case for “further factual findings relating to the accessibility of the foreign sales of the
claimed plants and the reproducibility of the claimed plants from the plants that were
sold.” kl_.

In this case, the examiner is relying upon app|icant’s admission that the claimed
plant “was sold in the United Kingdom in the fall ot 1998" as evidence that “European
Community Plant Breedefs Rights grant no. 4711" is enabled. Examiner's Answer,
page 2. However, there is no evidence whether the sales were of the type that would
be noticed by those of skill in the art. Nor has the other issue raised by the Federal
Circuit in m, whether the sales would enable one skilled in the art to reproduce the
claimed plant without undue experimentation, been addressed.

Accordingly, we vacate the examiner's rejection and remand the case to the

examiner to determine whether the sales of the claimed plant (1) were "an obscure,

enable one to reproduce the plant without undue experimentation.
