EX parte R. LEE ROBERTS,
MARK KEVIN ADDISON
and ANDREW SCOTT TAYLOR

Appeal No. 2002-1430
Application 09/935,365

ON BRIEF

Before COHEN, STAAB, and MCQUADE, Administrative Patent Judges.
MCQUADE, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQQEST FQR REHEARINQ

Pursuant to 37 CFR § l.197(b), R. Lee Roberts et al. request
rehearing of our decision on appeal rendered January 27, 2003
(Paper No. 27). The appellants have limited the request to that
part of the decision under the heading “IV. Additional matter for
consideration” wherein we stated:

[u]pon return of the application to the technology
center, the examiner should consider whether the

extruded multi-block sections or lengths disclosed by

Roberts and Berkebile, considered in conjunction with

the conventional 4 foot individual block length taught
by Brown ‘388 and admitted to be prior art [by]

the appellants (see pages 3 and 8 in the appellants’

specification) would have suggested a multi-block

section or length meeting the limitations in claims 6,

7 and 18, thereby warranting an appropriate § 103(a)

rejection of these claims [page 13].

On rehearing, the appellants raise two matters for
reconsideration. First, the appellants believe that the
reference to claim 18 instead of claim 28 was a typographical
error and seek correction thereof. Second, the appellants
“request that section IV of the Decision on Appeal be stricken in
its entirety” (request, page 3) as being unwarranted and
inconsistent with principles of res judicata because it instructs
the examiner to entertain “the precise issue considered by this
Board in section III of the Decision on Appeal” (request, page
2).

The appellants’ first point is well taken, but their second
is not.

Read in context, the reference in section IV of the decision
to claims 6, 7 and 18 clearly should have been to claims 6, 7 and
28. As surmised by the appellants, this mistake stemmed from a
typographical error.

As for its substantive content, section IV of the decision

merely proposed that the examiner consider whether the combined

teachings of Roberts, Berkebile and Brown ‘388 would have

suggested a multi—block section or length meeting the limitations
in claims 6, 7 and 18 [sic, 28], thereby leading to an
appropriate § 103(a) rejection of these claims. Although the
same references were employed by the examiner to reject claims 6,
7 and 28 under § 103(a), they were applied in a different manner
to conclude that it would have been obvious in view of Roberts or
Berkebile to modify the length of the underdrain block disclosed
by Brown ‘388 in order to form longer blocks necessary to support
longer filter media beds of liquid filtration systems. Finding
nothing in the disclosures by Roberts and Berkebile of extruded
multi—block sections or lengths intended to be cut into
individual blocks which would have suggested providing the
individual block disclosed by Brown ‘388 with a longitudinal
length any longer than its disclosed about 4 foot length, we
declined to sustain the rejection (see section III, pages 10 and
11 in the decision). In doing so, we found the Roberts,
Berkebile and Brown ‘388 references to be wanting only as to the
particular manner in which they were combined by the examiner to
support the rejection. Our suggestion that the examiner
reconsider the patentability of claims 6, 7 and 28 involves a
different application of these references, and consequently a

different issue. Accordingly, it does not run afoul of any

principles of res judicata, even if it is assumed that such
principles are relevant to these circumstances.

In light of the foregoing, section IV will not be stricken
from our decision, but it is modified to the extent that the
reference therein to “claims 6, 7 and 18” should be read as
——claims 6, 7 and 28——. Hence, the appellants’ request for

rehearing is granted—in—part.
