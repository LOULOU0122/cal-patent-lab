Appeal No. 2000-2202 Page 2
Application No. 08/810,049

OPINION
The Examiner relied on an Italian patent 590,156, identiﬁed as Avery Adhesive,
published on March 25, 1959 as evidence of obviousness. The Examiner states “Avery
Adhesive shows the construction of individual double sided adhesive tapes, 1 1, on a
continuous backing release layer, 20, with individual release sheets, 10, overlying the
individual tapes (See Figs. 1, 3).” (Answer, p. 4). The Examiner has not referred to the
text of the reference used to reach these determinations. It appears the Examiner has not
considered an English language translation of this document.’ A translation of this
document has now been obtained by the Board. The Examiner is required to consider the
translation of Italian patent 590,156 to determine if more or all of the limitations of the
claims on appeal are disclosed therein.
The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences is a board of review and not a

vehicle for initial examination. See 35 U.S.C. § 6(b)(2000). The burden is on the
Examiner to set forth a prima facie case of obviousness. See In re Alton, 76 F.3d 1168,

1175, 37 USPQ2d 1578, 1583 07 ed. Cir. 1996). Findings of fact and conclusions of law

2 We note that the Examiner should have obtained a complete translation of the reference during
prosecution, and not relied solely on the ﬁgures. It is now mandatory for such a translation to be
provided prior to forwarding the appeal to the Board. See, e.g. the April 29, 2002 memo from Deputy
Commissioner Kunin.

must be made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706 (A),
(E) (1994). See Zurko v. Dickinson, 527 U.S. 150, 158, 119 S.Ct. 1816, 1821, 50
USPQ2d 1930, 1934 (1999). Findings of fact relied upon in making the obviousness
rejection must be supported by substantial evidence within the record. See In re
Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1315, 53 USPQ2d 1769, 1775 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

In light of the above facts, we feel it is premature to decide this appeal. More fact
ﬁnding needs to be completed on the record by the Examiner in view of the full English
language translation. Particularly, the Examiner is required to point out on a limitation-
by-limitation basis which portions of the cited references correspond to the limitations
recited in the claims. It is important that ambiguous or obscure bases for decision do not
stand as barriers to a determination of patentability.

CONCLUSION
In summary, the instant application is remanded to the Examiner to consider the

aforementioned issues and to act accordingly.
