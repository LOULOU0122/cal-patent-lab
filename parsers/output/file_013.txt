Appeal No. 95-2687
Application No. 08/105,984

Specifically, appellant "believes that the Board's
decision leaves claims 9-12 of the application in a non-
rejected status.” Appellant requests confirmation of the

status of claims 9-12.

The decision on appeal mailed August 24, 1999, states

(Paper No. 13, page 9) :

The rejection of claims 1, 3-8 and 13-15 under
35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph, as lacking

descriptive support in the application, as
originally filed, is AFFIRMED. The rejection of
claims 1 and 3-15 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second
paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to
particularly point out and distinctly claim the
subject matter which applicants regard as the

invention is REVERSED.

Therefore, based on the record before us, claims 9-12 do
not currently stand rejected under any section of Title 35 of

the United States Code.

RANTED

WILLIAM F. SMITH
Administrative Patent Judge
