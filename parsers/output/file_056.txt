ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to appellant's request for rehearing

of our decision mailed March 29, 2001, wherein (among other

determinations) we affirmed the examiner's rejection of claims

1 Judge Cohen has been substituted on the merits panel of
the present application in place of Judge Lazarus, who has

retired. See, In zg Bgsg Corp., 772 F.2d 866, 869, 227 USPQ

l, 3 and 6 through 10 under 35 U.S.C. § lO2(b) as being

anticipated by Noiles (U.S. Patent No. 4,978,356).

We have carefully reviewed the points of argument raised
by appellant in the request, however, we note that instead of
directing the request for rehearing to points which were
misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the decision on
appeal as is mandated by 37 CFR § l.l97(b), appellant has
essentially made new grounds of argument (regarding dependent
claim 8) which were not previously presented in the brief on

appeal.

While appellant recognizes that no separate argument was
presented in the brief (Paper No. 11) or in the reply brief
(Paper No. 13) concerning the examiner's rejection of
dependent claim 8 under 35 U.S.C. § lO2(b) as being
anticipated by Noiles, appellant now urges that claim 8
deserves substantive consideration and characterizes this
Board's determination that dependent claims 7 and 8

(particularly claim 8) should fall with independent parent




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 2000-0451
Application No. 08/726,088

claim 6 as being "a specious basis for upholding an otherwise

defective rejection" (request, page 2).

37 CFR §§ l.l92(c)(7) and l.l92(c)(8)(iii) clearly place
the burden on appellant to state in the brief that the claims
of a given group subject to a particular ground of rejection
"do not stand or fall together" and also to present arguments
for the separate patentability of each of the claims to be
contested, and, with regard to a rejection based on 35 U.S.C.
§ l02, requires appellant to specify the error in the
rejection and to set forth why a particular claim or group of
claims is patentable, including any specific limitations in
the rejected claim or claims which are not present in the
prior art relied upon in the rejection. If, as in the present
case, appellant has not complied with the above dictates of 37
CFR § l.l92, then the regulation provides that the Board
"shall select a single claim from the group and shall decide
the appeal as to the ground of rejection on the basis of that
claim alone." As was made clear in the paragraph bridging
pages l2 and l3 of our decision mailed March 29, 2001, this is

essentially what transpired with regard to appellant's

Appeal No. 2000-0451
Application No. 08/726,088

Appellant's attempt to belatedly present new arguments
directed to the examiner's rejection of claim 8 under 35
U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Noiles is unavailing,
since a new argument advanced in a request for rehearing, but
not advanced in appellant's brief, is not properly before the
Board and will not be considered. See Ex_pa;;g_Hindg;§inn,

177 USPQ 78, 80 (Bd. App. 1971) and Ex_pa;;g_Ha;ygy, 163 USPQ

572, 573 (Bd. App. 1968) (Question not presented to Board in

appeal and not discussed by examiner is not appropriate for

decision by Board on petition for reconsideration). Note also

1986) and  ,

154 F.3d 1321, 1331, 47 USPQ2d 1896, 1904 (Fed. Cir. 1998)
wherein the Court noted that a party cannot wait until after
the Board has rendered an adverse decision and then present

new arguments in a request for reconsideration.

Regarding appellant's assertion (request, page 2) that
the limitation in claim 8 "is the same limitation on which the
Board patentably distinguished claim 4 from Moch," we suggest

that appellant might wish to read claims 4 and 8 again, since

Application No. 08/726,088

the limitations in these two claims are clearly not the same.
The limitations of claim 4 are much more precise as to the
curvature of the superior neck of the femoral stem and the

planes involved, than the broader recitation in claim 8.

In light of the foregoing, appellant's request is granted
to the extent of reconsidering our decision, but is denied

with respect to making any changes therein.
