BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

EX parte URBAN WIDLUND, GUNILLA HEDLUND,
and ROBERT KLING

Appeal No. 1998-2393
Application No. 08/295,874

REHEARING

Before COHEN, ABRAMS, and STAAB, Administrative Patent Judges.

COHEN, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON RE UEST FOR REHEARING

This is in response to appellants’ “REQUEST FOR REHEARING

UNDER 37 CFR § l.l97(b)" filed September 28, 2000 (hereafter

“request”) of our decision dated July 28, 2000 wherein we

made the following determinations:

Appeal No.

Application No.

1998-2393
O8/295,874

reversed the rejection of claims 14 through

41 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph,

as being indefinite;

reversed the rejection of claims 14 through

17, 20, 21, 23 through 31, 35, and 38

through 41 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as

being anticipated by Stevens;

affirmed the rejection of claims 14 through

18, 20, 21, and 26 under 35 U.S.C. § l02(a)

as being anticipated by Honshu Paper (the

Japanese reference);

affirmed the rejection of claims 23, 24, 28

through 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 41 under

35 U.S.C. § 102(a) as anticipated by or, in the

alternative, under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as obvious over

and

Honshu Paper (the Japanese reference);




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. l998—2393
Application No. 08/295,874

affirmed the rejection of claims 19, 22,
34, and 37 under 35 U.S.C. § lO3 as being
unpatentable over Honshu Paper (the

Japanese reference) in view of Villez.

In the request (page l), appellants assert that this
panel of the Board relied upon an inaccurate English
translation1 of the primary reference to Honshu paper in
affirming the rejections noted above. More particularly, it
is the view of appellants that the office translation prepared
by FLS, Inc. contains several significant errors. As
perceived by appellants, the reference in the office
translation to another separate “elastic” sheet is incorrect.
To support this conclusion appellants rely upon a duplicate
copy of a previously filed (February 28, l997) “Adati Patent
Office” (Adati) translation, now accompanied by a translator’s

certificate certifying as to its accuracy, which is indicated

1 As pointed out in footnote number 2 of our earlier
decision the translation referred to by appellants was

prepared in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

to make no mention of “elastic” in connection with the
separate sheet of different material. To confirm the Adati
translation, appellants also provide an additional partial
English translation referred to as Asamura Patent Office
(Asamura), which Asamura translation is indicated to show that

“elastic” in connection with

there is no mention of the word
the separate sheet. Based upon the inaccurate translation
relied upon by the Board, appellants conclude (request, page
7) that the earlier decision should be modified to reverse the
respective

final rejections of claims l4 through 24, 26, 28 through 38,

40, and 41.

Having fully considered the office translation of the
Japanese reference that we relied upon in sustaining the
examiner's rejections based thereon, the argument advanced in
the request, and the respective Adati and Asamura
translations, we find ourselves in accord with the appellants’
point of view that the office translation erred in referencing

the another separate sheet as being elastic.




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2393
Application No. 08/295,874

Without the separate sheet being elastic in the Japanese
reference, appellants argue (request, page 6) that the Board's
conclusion at the end of page 13 of the decision is no longer
fairly based since the stretchable elastic material 5 and
stretchable elastic material 13 together cannot be fairly said
to define an elastically stretchable region that covers
essentially the whole of at least one of the front and back
parts of the diaper as set forth independent claim 14. As
percieved by appellants, the Japanese reference shows only two
narrow strips of elastic 5,5, and 13 whereas with the present

invention a continuous region incorporates numerous elastic

elements 26.

In light of appellants’ commentary and our present
understanding of the Japanese reference, we share the View
that the applied Japanese document does not address at least
one elastically stretchable region covering essentially the
whole of at least one of the front and back parts of the
pants—type diaper of claim 14. Necessarily, it follows that
we also alter our earlier stated view (decision, page 13,

lines 1 through 7) by now indicating that the claimed “whole”

5




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. l998—2393
Application No. 08/295,874

of at least one front part and back part refers to the area of

the front or back part.

Since the evidence of obviousness would not have been
suggestive of at least one elastically stretchable region
covering essentially the whole of at least one of the front
and back parts of a pants—type diaper (claim l4), we modify
our earlier decision by not sustaining each of the examiner's
rejections under 35 U.S.C. § lO2(a) and 35 U.S.C. § lO3 which

we had earlier affirmed.

REMAND TO THE EXAMINER

We remand this application to the examiner to assess the
overall teaching of the Japanese reference with other known
prior art to ascertain whether it would have been obvious to
provide the waist band W and adjacent portions of surface

sheet l having stretchable elastic material 5, 13, in the

6




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 1998-2393
Application No. 08/295,874

panty style disposable diaper of the Japanese reference (Figs.
12 and 13), with additional stretchable elastic material to
effect at least one

elastically stretchable region covering essentially the whole
of at least one of respective front and back parts, as now

claimed.

In summary, appellants’ request for rehearing has been
granted and our earlier decision modified such that we do not
sustain each of the examiner's rejections under 35 U.S.C.
§ lO2(a) and 35 U.S.C. § 103 based upon the Japanese
reference. Accordingly, the decision of the examiner is
ggyngsﬁn (not AFFIRMED—IN—PART as originally set forth), since
each of the rejections on appeal has not been sustained.
Additionally, we have remanded the application to the examiner

to consider the matter discussed above.
