Paper No. 19

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte ANDREA MICHALIK

Appeal No. 2004-0386
Application No. 09/733,016

VACATUR AND REMAND

Before WILLIAM F. SMITH, ADAMS, and GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judges.

WILLIAM F. SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.

This appeal involves plant patent Application No. 09/733,016. The question
raised in this appeal involves whether evidence of foreign sales of the claimed
reproducible plant variety may enable an otherwise non-enabled printed publication
disclosing the plant, thereby creating a bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). The Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered that issue in In re Elsner, 381 F.3d 1125,

72 USPQ2d 1038 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and held in the affirmative. L; at 1128, 72 USPQ2d

at 1041. In so holding, the court stated that “[t]he foreign sale must not be an

obscure, solitary occurrence that would go unnoticed by those skilled in the art." Id_. at
1131, 72 USPQ2d at 1043. The court also stated that the record did not establish that
“even if the interested public would readily know of the foreign sales, those sales
enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to reproduce the claimed plants without undue
experimentation." Q Thus, the court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the
case for “further factual findings relating to the accessibility of the foreign sales of the
claimed plants and the reproducibility of the claimed plants from the plants that were
sold." Id_.

In this case, the examiner is relying upon applicant's admission that the claimed
plant “was sold outside the United States on or about July 1, 1998" as evidence that QZ
PBR 980521, PL PBR PBO 0050, C2 PBR OPPH 06594, and ZA PBR 02603 are
enabled. Examiner's Answer, pages 4-7. However, there is no evidence whether the
sales were of the type that would be noticed by those of skill in the art. Nor has the
other issue raised by the Federal Circuit in %, whether the sales would enable one
skilled in the art to reproduce the claimed plant without undue experimentation, been
addressed.

Accordingly, we vacate the examiner's rejection and remand the case to the

examiner to determine whether the sales of the claimed plant (1) were “an obscure,

solitary occurrence that would go unnoticed by those skilled in the art" and (2) would
enable one to reproduce the plant without undue experimentation.
