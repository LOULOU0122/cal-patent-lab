Application No. 08/616,549

If reconsideration by the examiner does not promptly result in the withdrawal of
all pending rejections, the examiner must return this application to the jurisdiction of
the board so that the appeal may be restored to its existing place in the order in which
appeals are decided. A new appeal number will not be assigned nor will a new appeal
fee be required in the event that the examiner returns this application to the jurisdiction
of the board following reconsideration.

This application, by virtue of its ‘‘special'' status, requires immediate action by
the examiner. See MPEP § 708.01 (d). The Board of Patent Appeals and lnterferences
must be informed promptly of any action affecting the appeal in this case, including

reopening of prosecution, allowance and/or abandonment of the application.
