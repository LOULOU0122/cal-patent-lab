ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Before STONER, Chief Administrative Patent Judge; HARKCOM, Vice Chief
Administrative Patent Judge; and WILLIAM F. SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.‘

WILLIAM F. SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge.
ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

In the original decision and supporting opinion entered on January 30, 2002, we
reversed two rejections and vacated a third. It is the latter action which appellants

request rehearing. Specifically, appellants ask:

1 Senior Administrative Patent Judge (SAPJ) McKe|vey served on the merits
panel which rendered the original decision in this appeal. Subsequent thereto, SAPJ
McKe|vey retired from the USPTO. Accordingly, Vice Chief Administrative Patent
Judge Harkcom has been designated as a member of the merits panel to decide this
request. Compare In re Bose Corg., 772 F.2d 866, 227 USPQ 1 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

Application No. 08/552,206

A. If the PTO insists on this law-based approach to solve its Markush
claim problem, it is requested that the Board withdraw its remand,
reinstate the examiner's Markush rejection after considering the
additional facts outlined below and permit applicants to appeal to
the Federal Circuit so that the patent community can get that
court's first take on this issue.

B. Alternatively, if the Board prefers, it is respectfully submitted, to
respect clear precedent, then, it is requested that it withdraw its
remand, confirm the propriety of appellant's [sic] Markush group,
and leave it to the director to establish a fair procedure to limit
unreasonable searching burdens caused by Markush claims.

We decline to take either action.

As explained at page 12 of our original opinion, "[r]ather than reverse the
rejection, we believe it more appropriate to vacate the rejection and remand the
application to the examiner for fact-finding in the ﬁrst instance with respect to the
Markush issue." We then set forth certain factors which we believe relevant in
detennining whether a Markush group is proper. As made clear at page 20 of our
opinion "nothing in this opinion should be construed as precluding a further rejection of
the claims based on (1) an improper Markush or other group or (2) prior art uncovered
as a result of an examination on the merits of the R‘ embodiments of claim 1 which are
not phenyl embodiments, matters on which we express no opinion on the merits"
(emphasis added).

The substance of appellants’ request takes issue with our observations
concerning factors which may be relevant in determining whether a Markush group is
proper. We decline to reinstate the examiner’s rejection as requested because, as set

forth in detail in our original opinion, the examiner failed to make appropriate ﬁndings of

fact to support such a rejection. In making our observations in regard to improper

Markush groups, we made clear that we were not making such findings but, rather,
delineating factors which may prove helpful in resolving the issue. What is needed is a
reasoned exchange of views by the examiner and applicants in the context of an e_x
ite examination/prosecution, not in the context of a request for rehearing in an appeal
proceeding before this board.

Nor do we find appellants’ proposed alternative relief that we "conﬁrm the
propriety of appellants‘ Markush group" appropriate. Again, as explained in our original
opinion, we believe there is a substantive issue in this application concerning whether
the Markush group set forth in the claims on appeal is proper. By vacating the
examiner's rejection and remanding the application to the examiner to further consider
the issue, appellants will have their "day in court" in front of the examiner in the context
of an agar‘; examination where this issue can be fully explored. Any further action in
this application by the examiner will undoubtedly take into account the views expressed
by appellants in their request for rehearing before this board. It may be that the
examiner will detennine that the claims do not contain an improper Markush group
which would end the matter. On the other hand, if the examiner does determine that
the claims contain an improper Markush group, he will undoubtedly reopen prosecution
and institute such a rejection in a manner which provides appellants a full and fair
opportunity to respond. It is only after such a reasoned exchange of views that this
board will be in a position to ﬁnally determine the matter.

We have carefully reviewed appellants‘ request for rehearing but decline to
change our decision in any manner.

REHEARING DENIED
