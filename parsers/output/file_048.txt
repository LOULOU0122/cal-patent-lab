and YAUH-CHING LIU

Appeal No. 1999-1548
Application No. 08/859,629

ON BRIEF

Before KRASS, DIXON and BARRY, Administrative Patent Judges.

KRASS, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants ﬁled a “Request for consideration“ on January 10, 2002, wherein
appellants requested that we consider that part of our decision of September 27, 2001
in which we remanded the case back to the examiner and to appellants for more

information regarding the rejection of claims 53-98 over 35 U.S.C. § 103. In particular,

‘More properly termed a “Request for Rehearing.”

we asked the parties to deﬁne and identify what a “planarization” layer is meant to cover

and why the applied references were deemed to suggest or not suggest such a

“planarization” layer.

Based on remarks received from appellants (Paper No. 44) and the examiner
(Paper No. 45), we issued a supplemental decision on July 29, 2002 (Paper No. 46),

wherein we sustained the rejection of claims 53-59, 62-64, 86-92 and 94-98 under 35
U.S.C. § 103, but we did not sustain the rejection of claims 60, 61, 65-85 and 93 under

35 U.S.C. § 103. Our reasons are adequately set forth in Paper No. 46, and we need

not repeat them here.

While appellants’ request for reconsideration of January 10, 2002 (Paper No. 47)
was ﬁled prior to our supplemental decision, it was entered into the file subsequent to

our supplemental decision, and we did not have the beneﬁt of it when reaching our

decision of July 29, 2002.

However, we have now reviewed that request for reconsideration and ﬁnd that it
does not differ from the request for reconsideration made in Paper No. 44. Since we
have already treated any such arguments and/or comments by appellants in our

supplemental decision, and appellants have not convinced us of any error in our

supplemental decision of July 29, 2002, we deny appellants’ request for

reconsideration.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal

may be extended under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).

DENIED
