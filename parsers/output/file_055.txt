ON REHEARING

 

Before THOMAS, and TORCZON, ' ' t t" e a n

Judges.

JERRY SMITH,

TORCZON, Administrative Patent Judge.
DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
Appellant's request on rehearing for withdrawal (Paper

No. 19 at 2) of our prior decision on appeal (Paper No. 18) is
denied.
BACKGROUND
Appellant discloses a semiconductor device using fuses or
diodes to protect the remaining circuitry from electrostatic

damage. (Paper No. 1 at 2-3 and 5-6.) In the decision under

rehearing, we reversed two rejections based on our finding

that a resistor would not meet the claim requirement for an

"opening structure". We affirmed, however, the rejection of

_TA

all claims under 35 U.S.C. § 103 in view of Appellant's
admitted prior art (Figures 5 and 6) and:

Ukai et al. (Ukai) 5,068,748 26 Nov. 1991
Our conclusion of obviousness was based in part on our finding
that a diode, such as those taught in Ukai, would meet the
claim requirement for an opening structure. According to
Appellant,

The Board then asserted that it would have been

obvious to combine the diodes of Ukai with the

structure of the admitted prior art in order to

result in the claimed invention. The fundamental

error in this analysis is that Ukai does not teach

or suggest the use of an “opening structure" as

claimed because diodes, which are structures that

prevent the transmission of electrical current in a
single direction, are not suggestive of opening

structures that prevent the transmission of

electrical current in either direction.
(Paper No. 19 at 1.) Note that Appellant is not contesting
the combination but rather the finding that diodes are opening
structures and the claim construction that permits that
finding.

DISCUSSION

As we noted in our decision (Paper No. 18 at 2), during
prosecution a claim must be construed as broadly as is
reasonably possible in light of the disclosure and the related

prior art. E.g., In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d

1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989). This practice reflects the broad




*** PAGE 3 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603 Page 3

Application No. 08/243,839

latitude applicants have during prosecution to amend their
claims to clarify their intent and to avoid prior art. Id;;
In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1056, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1029 (Fed.
Cir. 1997).

The starting point for claim construction is always the
language of the claim itself. Comark Comm. Inc. v. Harris
Q9;p;, 156 F.3d 1182, 1186, 48 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir.
1998); Desper Prods. Inc. v. Qsound Labs. Inc., 157 F.3d 1325,
1332, 48 USPQ2d 1088, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Appellant stated

that all of the appealed claims stood or fell together.

(Paper No. 11 at 3.) Pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7), we
selected claim 4 as representative of the group. (Paper No.
18 at 1-2.) Claim 4 requires "an opening structure in said

connection pattern." The claim itself does not define
"opening structure" beyond the functional limitation that it
open something at sometime and the structural limitation that
it be in the connection pattern. Nothing in the language of
claim 4 excludes a diode as an opening structure or requires
the use of a fuse pattern. Both the specification and the
related art support our construction that an opening structure
may be a diode.

In the specification, Appellant explains the opening

structure as follows:




*** PAGE 4 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603 Page
Application No. 08/243,839

The present invention is characterized in that the

connection pattern has opening structures for

dealing with an external overcurrent provided on

both sides of the division lines. Specifically[,]

the opening structures are constituted by fuse

patterns. Alternatively, the opening structure may

be constituted by diodes having a reduced gate

width.
(Paper No. l at 6, emphasis added; see also Paper No. l at ll
(explaining how the diodes open in response to an overcurrent
before the transistors of the internal circuit are damaged).)
The genus of opening structures is bounded by the fact that

each "must have a property such that predetermined

conductivity is maintained unless an overcurrent is applied

and it opens when such an overcurrent is applied." (Paper No.
l at l2.) As indicated, however, a diode meets these
requirements. The specification expressly contradicts

Appellant's argument on rehearing that the opening structure
cannot be a diode.

Ukai also supports our construction of opening
structures. Appellant has not contested our finding (Paper
No. l8 at 4) that Ukai is directed to the same problem (see
Ukai at 2:20-3:36), i.e., protecting display circuits from
electrostatic discharge. Ukai uses coupling elements 42 in

connection patterns between two guard rings 31, 32 to protect

display circuits from static electricity. (4:49—60.) The




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603 Page 5
Application No. 08/243,839

coupling elements may be non—linear elements, e.g., diodes.
(4:37—44.) As we noted in our decision (Paper No. 18 at 4),
Appellant's brief on appeal did not address these non—linear
elements. Ukai's diodes shunt static discharge from
terminals 20 to the internal short circuiting bus 32. As
Appellant notes (Paper No. 19 at 1), however, the orientation
of the diode determines whether the diode appears to be an
open circuit or a short circuit in the presence of a high
voltage. Claim 4 does not specify a direction in which the
opening structure must be open, nor does it exclude an
internal short—circuiting bus to which static discharge may be
shunted as in Ukai.

Appellant belatedly refers to claim l3 on rehearing
(Paper No. l9 at 2). Claim l3 was not separately argued in
the original appeal nor is its use now consistent with
Appellant's election to have the claims stand or fall
together. The limitations of claim 13 cannot be read into the
other claims. In any case, Appellant does not explain how the
limitations of claim 13 are inconsistent with our construction
of claim 4. Nothing in claim 13 excludes diodes, requires a

fuse, or specifies any direction of conductance.




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 96-3603
Application No. 08/243,839

Fundamentally, we disagree with Appellant's construction
of his claim. Appellant urges that

the use of a diode that conducts in a given

direction neither teaches nor suggests the use of a

fuse that will conduct in neither direction upon the

occurrence of an overcurrent condition but that will

conduct in either direction prior to such an event.
(Paper No. l9 at 2.) Assuming, arguendo, the truth of that

statement, it does not represent the entire scope of the

subject matter that Appellant has claimed.
