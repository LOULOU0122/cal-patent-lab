Appeal No. 1997-3137
Application No. 07/978,670

Before WINTERS, WILLIAM F. SMITH, and GRIMES 
WILLIAM F. SMITH.

Appellant requests rehearing of this appeal in light of our decision entered January

examiner, in which event the application will be remanded to the examiner. Second,

Douglas Burkett.” Manifestly, the request is improper. In essence, appellant is requesting

submissions and take whatever action is deemed appropriate.

Appellant’s request for rehearing is denied to the extent it asks the merits panel to

review the new ground of rejection in light of the new record. Upon return of the

deemed appropriate.
