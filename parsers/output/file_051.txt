REHEARING

Before ABRAMS, FRANKFORT2 and GONZALES, Administrative Patent
Judges.

ABRAMS, A 'n' r "v a nt u

ON REQUEST FOR REHARING
This case comes before us again on request by the

appellant for rehearing of our decision of August 31, 1999,

 

1 Application for patent filed May 24, 1995.

2Judge Frankfort was designated to this panel for the
rehearing in place of Judge Meister, who has retired.

wherein we sustained the rejection of claims 1-7, 10-12 and
14-22 under

35 U.S.C. § 103.3 It is the appellant's position that the
panel erred in agreeing with the examiner that it would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the
Turner system by replacing the shelves upon which the
substrates are supported during heating with the open trays of
Yamabe. Upon reconsideration of this decision in the light of
the presentation made by the appellant in the Request for
Rehearing, we have come to the conclusion that our original
decision on this matter should be modified in conformance with
the following comments.

Independent claim 1 is exemplary of the appellant's
invention, in that it requires that there be a substrate
holding stack adapted to hold the substrates in a spaced
generally “open stacked configuration" such that the sides of
the substrates directly opposite one another are able to

directly transfer heat between adjacent substrates. All of

3Not sustained were rejections of claims 1-7 and 9-22
under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first and second paragraphs, and a
rejection of claims 9 and 13 under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

the other independent claims also contain a limitation which
focuses on adjacent substrates being so positioned and
oriented as to allow heat to be radiated between their facing
surfaces. The claims stand rejected by the examiner as being
unpatentable over Turner in View of Yamabe.

Turner discloses a substrate processing system that
includes a plurality of heating chambers which are maintained
at a desired temperature by heaters located in the chamber
walls. Within each chamber are a plurality of vertically
spaced substrate support shelves, each having a pair of
dielectric mounts upon which the substrates to be treated are
placed in spaced relationship from the shelves. In a
continuous process, a loading system successively places
unheated individual substrates onto the shelves and then
removes them when they have been heated to the desired
temperature. The shelves are made of heat conductive material
and are of solid construction, therefore blocking direct
radiation of heat between the faces of adjacent substrates.
Once heated to operating temperature by the heaters in the
walls of the chamber, the shelves continuously radiate heat to

the faces of adjacent substrates so that the substrates are

Application No. 08/449,809

“radiantly heated . . . uniformly from both sides, which
provides for rapid and uniform heating” (column 5, lines 49-
51).

Yamabe discloses a system in which a plurality of
substrates are positioned on support shelves and then are
loaded into a heating chamber in a batch, at which point the
chamber is heated until the substrates reach the proper
processing temperature. The Yamabe shelves have open centers
and support the substrates only at their outer peripheries,
which allows the faces of the substrates directly opposite one
another to be in open relationship. A relatively large heat-
absorbing mass is configured into the peripheral portion of
each shelf. In operation, as the chamber is brought up to the
desired temperature by the heaters in the chamber walls, heat
is radiated inwardly toward the surfaces of the substrates.

If left unchecked, the tendency would be for the peripheral
portion of each substrate to absorb more heat than the central
portion, as is illustrated in Figure 5, resulting in uneven
heating of the substrate. The mass of material on the
peripheries of the shelves counteracts this tendency by

absorbing some of that heat. See column 3, line 67 et seq.;

column 5, lines 1-9; column 6, lines 44-46; column 7, line 29
et seq.

The dispositive issue in this case is whether it would
have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to
modify the Turner system by replacing the solid shelves with
the open shelves disclosed in the Yamabe system. We now are
persuaded to answer this in the negative, on the basis of the
following reasoning. Both systems utilize heaters located
outwardly of the peripheries of the substrates and seek to
provide even heat distribution across the exposed faces of the
substrates, but they accomplish this in different ways because
of the difference between continuous and batch processing. It
is axiomatic that the mere fact that the prior art structure
gguld be modified does not make such a modification obvious
unless the prior art suggests the desirability of doing so.
See, for example,

In re Gordon, 733 F.2d 900, 902, 221 USPQ 1125, 1127 (Fed.
Cir. 1984). In the present case, we fail to perceive any
teaching, suggestion or incentive in either reference which

would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the




*** PAGE 6 ***

Application No. 08/449,809

Turner system by replacing the solid heat radiating shelves
with the open heat absorbing shelves of Yamabe. First, there
is no explicit teaching or indication that it would be
advantageous to utilize open shelves in the Turner system.
Second, replacing Turner's solid heat—radiating shelves with
Yamabe’s open shelves would result in uneven heating of the
substrates in the Turner continuous process system because the
masses on peripheries of the open shelves would unnecessarily
absorb heat. Thus, the even heating provided by the solid
shelves in the Turner system would be compromised, which would
have been a disincentive to one of ordinary skill in the art
to make the proposed substitution.

We therefore conclude that the combined teachings of
Turner and Yamabe fail to establish a prima facie of
obviousness with regard to the subject matter of independent
claims l, l0, l4, l8 and l9, and we will not sustain the
rejection of these claims under 35 U.S.C. § lO3 or, it
follows, the claims dependent thereon.

Upon rehearing, our prior decision is modified as
follows:

The examiner's rejection of claims l—7 and 9-22 under 35
