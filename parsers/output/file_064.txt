Appeal No. 1996-3533
Application 08/203,624

HEARD: February 9, 2000

Before PAK, WARREN and WALTZ, Administrative Patent Judges.

WARREN, Administrative Patent Judge.
On Request F or Rehearing

Appellants request rehearing under 37 CFR § 1.197(b) (1997) of our decision dated February
29, 2000 (Paper No. 27) aﬂirrning the examiner’s rejection of appealed claims 1 through 20 under 35
U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over Gamble in view of Morgan. Appellants contend (1) that our
opinion includes new grounds of rejection of (a) claims 5 and 6, because the examiner “did not rely on
‘admitted prior art’ to rejec ” these claims, and (b) of claim 18, because the examiner “did not rely on
‘overlapping subject matter’ to reject” this claim, that were not designated as such under 37 CFR §
1.196(b) (1997); and (2) that we must reverse the gound of rejection of record because we gave “the
claimed phrase ‘in a resin’ . . . an unreasonable interpretation” in our opinion (request, page 1).

Appeal No. 96—3533
Application 08/203,624

Appellants submit, with respect to their ﬁrst contention, that the “Courts have recognized
Appellants’ right to respond to new grounds of rejection advanced for the ﬁrst time in a decision on
appeal” (id., page 2). We agree with appellants that this is the case if a new grormd of rejection was in
fact made in a decision on appeal. Indeed, the issue presented here is whether our opinion in support of
our affrrrrrance of claims 5 and 6 and of claim 18 included a new ground of rejection of these two
groups of claims. With respect to whether a new ground of rejection was in fact made in a decision on
appeal, the predecessor court to our reviewing court set forth the general proposition that “the ultimate
criterion of whether a rejection is considered ‘new’ in a decision by the board is whether appellants
have had fair opportunity to react to the thrust of the rejection.” In re Kronig, 539 F.2d 13(1), 1302-
03, 190 USPQ 425, 426-427 (CCPA 1976) (“In affirming, the board used the same basis, but without
disagreeing with the examiner’ s approach, limited its discussion to the evidence contained” in three of
the four cited references, relying thereon for the same evidence used by the examiner, such that
“[h]aving compared the rationale of the rejection advanced by the examiner and the board on this
record, we are convinced that the basic thrust of the rejection at the examiner and the board level was
the same.”); see also In re Boon, 439 F.2d 724, 727-28, 169 USPQ 231, 234 (CCPA 1971) (Even
though the board’s opinion included “ampliﬁed reasons” in support of the aflirrnance of the exarr1iner’s
rejection that were based on “additional facts, not previously in the record, of which the board took
notice[,] . . . we are satisﬁed from our review of the record that, even when such facts are included, the
‘evidentiary scheme’ supporting the board’s position on this rejection does not differ in substance from
that of the examiner,” as “the fact so noticed plays a minor role, serving only ‘to ﬁll in the gaps’ which
might exist in the evidentiary showing made by the examiner . . . . [In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 165
USPQ 418 ([CCPA] 1970)]. Under such circumstances, as we held in Ahlert, an applicant must be
given the opportunity to challenge either the correctness of the fact asserted or the notoriety or repute of
the reference cited in support of the assertion,” which challenge must “contain adequate information or
argument so that on its face it creates a reasonable doubt regarding the circumstances justifying the
judicial notice.”).

With respect to claims 5 and 6, appellants submit that our reliance on admitted prior art set forth
in appellants’ speciﬁcation in affirming the examiner’s ground of rejection constituted “a different

-2-

Application O8/203,624

rationale and different evidence” than advanced by the examiner in tl1e answer because the examiner
relied “only on Gamble combined with Morgan throughout the prosecution “without any menti of any
alleged prior an admissions” (request, pages 3-5). While we agree that the examiner did not rely on
admitted prior art in the ground of rejection, we cannot agree that appellants’ analysis adequately
reﬂects the record.

Appealed claim 5 modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1, wherein the applying step comprises
spraying the coating material on the substrate” while claim 6 modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1, wherein
the applying step is carried out with an air nozzle spray gun.” In explaining the ground of rejection in the
answer (pages 4-5), the examiner stated that “Morgan teaches that resinlﬁber mixtures used as EMI
shields can be applied by spraying” in taking the position that one of ordinary skill in this art would have
reasonably expected “that the resin(ﬁber mixture of Gamble could be successfully applied by
spraying based on the combined teachings of Gamble and Morgan” (emphasis supplied). In
response to appellants’ arguments in their principal brief speciﬁcally directed to claims 5 and 6, i.e.,
‘Morgan fails to provide the necessary incentive or motivation to modify Gamble in a manner which
would result in a coating applied to a substrate nmch less applying the coating by spraying,” (page 14),
the examiner stated (answer, page 9; emphasis supplied):

Claim 5 recites spraying. Morgan clearly teaches spraying.

Claimérecitesthatthe applying stepiscauiedoutusinganairnozzle spray gun. Morganis
silent regarding the type of spray gun to be used. Since Morgan is silent with respect to the
typeofsprayguntobeused,theslcilledartisanwouldhavetotumtothepriorarttoﬁnda
suitable spray gun to use. Air nozzle spray guns are conventional and commonplace in the
coating art and the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation that an air
nozzle spray gun would successfully function as the generic spray gun of Morgan.

In theirreply brief (page 9), appellants point out in argument with respect to claims 3 and 4 that
“the fact that Morgan fails to disclose how the spraying is performed cannot possibly be a disclosure of
pressurizing a container,” and state that “[t]he same reasoning applies to Claim 6 which recites that the
applying step is carried out with an air nozzle spray gun, a feature not taught or suggested by Morgan.”
The examiner stated in the supplemental answer (page 3), that the limitations of claim 6 “were

Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

thoroughly addressed” in the section of the answer we set forth above. Appellants did not respond
ﬁrrther with respect to this matter in their supplemental reply brief
In considering claims 5 and 6, we stated in our original opinion (pages 10- 11):

With respect to claims 5 and 6, we ﬁnd that appellants admit that coating material
compositions comprising at least ﬁbers contained in a resin matrix were known in the art to
be applied to a substrate by “spraying” with an “air nozzle spray gun” in disclosing that

standard top—feed pressure—pot spray systems with either extemal— or intemal—mix
needle valve spray guns have been found to promote ﬁber clumping and breakage
since they do not provide a smooth, Imrestricted passage for the ﬁber containing
matrix. [Page 4, lines 7- 10; emphasis supplied.]

We point out with respect to this disclosure that there is no limitation in the appealed claims
which speciﬁes the condition of the ﬁbers in the spray_nozzle during the spraying action (see
supra pp. 5- 6). Even if the claims contained such a limitation, the selection of solvents which
facilitate spraying of an El\/II coating composition that can contain conductive ﬁbers was
within the ordinary skill in the art as seen from the teachings of Morgan (e.g., col. 4, line 45,
col. 5, lines 26-42, col. 6, lines 7- 15 and 30-44).

Furthermore, in addition to appellants’ admission, we ﬁnd that Morgan would have
reasonably suggested to one of ordinary skill in this art that coating material compositions,
such as those taught in Gamble, can be applied to a substrate by spraying because Morgan
teaches that this method is one of a number of conventional coating techniques which can be
used with coating compositions containing ﬁbers and resin (e.g., col. 4, line 45, and col. 6,
lines 7- 11) and, as we found above, discloses that the solvent used in the compositions
should be selected accordingly. Indeed, Gamble does not limit the manner in which the
compositions disclosed therein can be applied to a substrate and further discloses that
“[v]arious chemical additives” can be added to these compositions “for their art-recognized
purposes” (col. 6, lines 35-40). Thus, the compositions of Gamble can contain the same
solvents as contained by the compositions of Morgan, which compositions would fall within
those used in the claimed methods of the appealed claims. Accordingly, one of ordinary skill
in this art following the combined teachings of Gamble and Morgan in light of the knowledge
in the art as admitted by appellants, prima facie, would have applied the compositions of
Gamble to a substrate using conventional spraying methods with the reasonable expectation
of forming a coating on the substrate. [Citations ornitted.]

In considering appellant’s arguments, we referred to the limitation “to a speciﬁc type of spray gun (claim
6, dependent on claim 1) (see reply brief, page 9)” (opinion, page 12).

On this record, it is apparent that the issue of whether the “applying step is canied out with an
air nozzle gun” is lirrrited to claim 6 as this limitation does not appear in claim 5. It is further apparent




*** PAGE 5 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

from the record that issues raised by the examiner of whether “[a]ir nozzle spray guns are conventional
and commonplace in the coating art” and whether “the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable
expectation that an air noule spray gun would successfully ﬁmction as the generic spray gun of Morgan”
also were made with respect to claim 6 and were at least noticed by appellants in their reply brief with
respect to claim 6. Thus, these issues were placed squarely before appellants in the answer and in the
supplemental answer, providing appellants with the opportunity to respond to the examiner’s ﬁndings in
the answer in their reply brief and in their supplemental brief. Appellants did not challenge the
examiner’s ﬁndings in either of these briefs, not1'r1g only in the former that the lirrritation of claim 6 is “a
feature not taught or suggested by Morgan.” Because appellants did not take either opportunity to
challenge the exarr1iner’s notice that “[a]ir nozzle spray guns are conventional and commonplace in the
coating art,” we considered the examiner’s ﬁndings to be conclusive, although we did not expressly so
state in our opinion. See generally, In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 1091-92, 165 USPQ 418, 420-21
(CCPA 1970).

Following the lead of the examiner that “[a]ir nozzle spray guns are conventional and
commonplace in the coating art,” we pointed out in the section of our original opinion set forth above, to
the admission in appellants’ speciﬁcation that “coating material compositions comprising at least ﬁbers
contained in a resin matrix were known in the art to be applied to a substrate by ‘spraying’ with an ‘air

7”

nozzle spray gun. We then separately discussed the issue of whether ‘Morgan wo11ld have reasonably
suggested to one of ordinary skill in this art that coating material compositions, such as those taught in
Gamble, can be applied to a substrate by spraying,” and concluded on the combined teachings of
Gamble and Morgan, along with the admission as to claim 6, that ‘prima facie, would have applied the
compositions of Gamble to a substrate using conventional spraying methods with the reasonable
expectation of forming a coating on the substrate,” which did not emphasize the issue of the
conventionality 0 “air nozzle spray glms.”

Thus, while we recognized that appellants’ disclosure contained an aclmowledgermnt that “air
nozzle spray guns” were known in the art, as noticed by the examiner, it is apparent that the position
advanced by the examiner was indeed the basis for the ground of rejection on appeal with respect to
claims 5 and 6 and our afﬁrmance thereof with respect to these claims. Therefore, we did no more in

-5-




*** PAGE 6 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

our opinion than further note the conventionality of “air nozzle spray guns” with the additional
particularity of pointing to the admission in appellants’ speciﬁcation.

Thus, upon reconsideration of our decision to affirm the examiner’s ground of rejection with
respect to claims 5 and 6 hr light of appellants’ arguments and authority advanced in their request, on
this record, we cannot discern that we have changed the thrust of the examiner’s ground of rejection, or,
ir1 other words, the evidentiary scheme that we have described in our opinion with the ampliﬁed
reasoning set forth therein based on facts of record does not differ ir1 substance from that set forth by
the examiner ir1 his answer. Indeed, it is apparent that appellants had ample “fair opportunity” to react
to the thrust or evidentiary scheme of the rejection with respect to claim 6 based on the examiner’s
notice of the conventionality of “air nozzle spray guns” even in View of our opinion. Kronig, supra; cf.
Boon, supra; In re Waymouth, 486 F.2d 1058, 1060-61,179 USPQ 627, 629 (CCPA 1973).

Accordingly, we decline to designate our afﬁrmance of the examiner’s rejection of claims 5 and
6 as a new ground of rejection under 37 CFR § 1.196(b) (1997).

With respect to claim 18, appellants submit that “it is clear [from the answer] that the Examiner
did not reject claim 18 on the basis of ‘overlapping subject matter’ between the claimed range and the
range disclosed in Gamble” and “it is clear [from the answer and supplemental answer] that the
Examiner considered the range set forth ir1 claim 18 to be different from, not overlapping, the range ir1
Gamble” while we stated ir1 our opinion that the teachings of Gamble “overlaps” the range speciﬁed in
this claim. Thus, appellants argue that ‘The Board adopted a different line of reasoning than the
Examiner in afﬁrming the rejection of claim 18 (request, pages 5-7). We cannot subscribe to
appellants’ position.

Claim 18 modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1, wherein the ﬁbers comprise less than 0.2% by
weight of the coating.” In the answer, the examiner, in considering claim 7, stated that “Gamble teaches
that the ﬁbers make up 1 to 45% of the coating” (page 9) and, found with respect to claim 18 that “[i]t
would have been obvious to the skilled artisan, in the absence of a showing of criticality, to have
determined the optimum amount of ﬁbers to be added to the resin through routine experimentation”
(pages 10-11). After urging the separate patentability of claim 18 solely on the basis that “the ﬁbers
comprise less than 0.2% by weight of the coating” hr the principal brief (pages 14- 15), appellants argue

-5-




*** PAGE 7 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

in their reply brief that “Gamble prefers 2 to 20%” and thus “teaches away from the claimed invention
since the unpreferred 1% lower limit of Gamble’s ﬁbers is still 500% greater than the upper limit recited
in claim 18” (page 10). The examiner points out in the supplemental answer that ‘The actual difference
between the two values is 0.8 wt % and this small difference is considered to be an obvious
modiﬁcation of [Gamble] in the absence of a showing of criticalityf’ (page 4). In their supplemental reply
brief, under the heading “Absence of overlapping subject matter negates Examiner’s requirement for
‘showing of criticality”’ (page 1), appellants argue that “[t]he Examiner has provided absolutely no
reasoning to support the assertion that it would have been obvious to lower the lower limit of the ﬁber
content in the composite of Gamble to within the range set forth in Claim 18” and thus “has failed to
establish a prima facie case of obviousness with respect to” this claim (page 5).
hr considering claim 18, we stated in our original opinion (pages 14- 15; italic emphasis in

original; underline emphasis supplied):

As we set forth above (see supra p. 11), Gamble would have taught one of ordinary skill in
this art that the selection of these materials is based on the desired EMI characteristics of the
shield to be prepared. We are not persuaded otherwise by the limitations with respect to the
amount of ﬁber which is speciﬁed in unrelated dependent claims 7[1] and 18. In this respect,
we fail to ﬁnd any teaching in Gamble which would place a lower limit on the amount of
ﬁbers, conductive (claims 7 and 18) and non—conductive (claim 18), that can be dispersed in
the resin matrix. Indeed, Gamble discloses that the conductive ﬁber, such as those speciﬁed
ir1 claim 7 (col. 4, line 30, and col. 4, line 30, to col. 5, line 5), “advantageously comprises . .
. about 1 . . . percent by weight of the ElVlI shield” (col. 5, lines 9-11; emphasis supplied),
which disclosure in view of the term “abou ” would have been considered one of by ordinary
skill in this art to reasonably encompass ﬁber “in an amount less than 1 wt % of the coating”
as speciﬁed ir1 claim 7. We are ﬁnther of the opinion that this disclosure of Gamble along
with the ﬁrrther teaching that any amount of non—conductive ﬁber could be used (col. 6, lines
46-54), would also have suggested to one of ordinary skill in this art that an even smaller
amount of ﬁbers may be present, including a content of “less than 0.2% by weight of the
coating” as speciﬁed ir1 claim 18. Thus, we agree with the examiner that the range of the
percent by weight of ﬁber, conductive and non— conductive, which can be contained in the
compositions of the claims, overlaps with the range of such ﬁbers in Gamble. Indeed, in

1 We observe that claim 7, which was not include hr the request, modiﬁes “[t]he method of claim 1,
wherein . . . the ﬁbers comprising n1etal- coated dielectric or semiconductive ﬁbers ir1 an amount of less
than 1 wt % of the coating” and thus would encompass methods that utilize at least part of the types of
ﬁbers and the amount thereof as speciﬁed for methods encompassed by claim 18.

-7-




*** PAGE 8 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

View of the teaching in the reference that the amount of ﬁber employed depends on the
desired properties, the absence of a lower limit for the ﬁber in Gamble would have
reasonably suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art that the ﬁbers can be used in an
amount which encompasses the claimed ranges. Under these circumstances, the burden is
on appellants to demonstrate the criticality of the claimed ranges. In re Geixler, 116 F.3d
1465, 1470, 43 USPQ2d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1997); In re Waodruﬂ, 919 F.2d 1575,
1577-78, 16 USPQ2d 1934, 1936-37 (Fed. Cir. 1990); In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456,
105 USPQ 233, 235 (CCPA 1955).

We must agree with appellants that we incorrectly attributed to the examiner our ﬁnding that the
teachings of Gamble “overlaps” with the methods of claim 18. In addition to this characterization of the
teachings of Gamble vis-a-Vis the methods of clainr 18, we also expressed the opinion that “in view of
the teaching in the reference that the amount of ﬁber employed depends on the desired properties, the
absence of a lower limit for the ﬁber in Gamble wo11ld have reasonably suggested to one of ordinary
skill in the art that the ﬁbers can be used in an amount which encompasses the claimed ranges.” While
our ﬁndings present a more comprehensive review of the teachings of Gamble vis-a-vis the methods of
claim 18 than that presented by the examiner in stating that Gamble teaches that the ﬁbers can be
present in an amount of 1 wt %, we consider our ﬁnding that the teachings of “Gamble wo11ld have
reasonably suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art that the ﬁbers can be used in an amount which
encompasses the claimed ranges” to be essentially the same as the examiner’s ﬁndings that one of
ordinary skill in the art would “have determined the optimum amount of ﬁbers to be added to the resin
through routine experimentation” and that “the actual difference between [1 wt % and less than 0.2 wt
%] is 0.8 wt % and this small difference is considered to be an obvious modiﬁcation of [Gamble].” We
agreed with the examiner that the ﬁnding of primafacie obviousness of the amount of “ﬁbers
comprising less than 0.2% by weight of the coating” in claim 18 over the teachings of Gamble, which
does not disclose that amount per se, was such as to shift the burden to appellants to demonstrate the
criticality of the amount of ﬁbers speciﬁed in that claim.

On this record, it is apparent that our afﬁrrnance of the examiner’s ground of rejection with
respect to claim 18 was not based solely on the ﬁnding of an “overlap” between the amount of ﬁbers
according to the teachings of Gamble and the amount speciﬁed in claim 18. Indeed, we lmow of no

authority which holds that a primafacie case of obviousness is established only when there is an




*** PAGE 9 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application O8/203,624

“overlap” in the claimed and prior art ranges of a particular process parameter or ingredient. Rather, a
primafacie case of obviousness is dependent on whether one of ordinary skill in the art would have
reasonably expected that the proportion or range of the claimed invention encompassed by the
appealed claims would result in the same properties or achieve the same results as the proportion or
range of the applied prior art. See generally, Haynes Int'l, Inc. v. Jessop Steel Co., 8 F.3d 1573,
1577 n.3, 28 USPQ2d 1652, 1655 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (‘The Board’s position was consonant with
this court’s precedent holding that when the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is
the range or value of a particular variable, then a primafacie rejection is properly established when the
differencein range orvalueis minor. In re Woodruﬂ, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578, 16 USPQ2d 1934, 1936
(Fed. Cir. 1990); Titanium Metals Corp. of America v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775,783, 227 USPQ
773, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1985).”).

Thus, upon reconsideration of our decision to aﬂirm the exarniner’s ground of rejection with
respect to claim 18 in light of appellants’ argurmnts advanced in their requmt, on this record, we ﬁnd
that we cannot discern that we have changed the thrust of the exa.rniner’s grounds of rejection, or, in
other words, the evidentiary scherm that we have described in our opinion with the arrrpliﬁed reasoning
set forth therein based onfacts of record does not differ in substance from that set forth by the examiner
in the answer. Indeed, it is apparent that appellants had ample “fair opportunity” to react to the thrust or
evidentiary scheme of the rejection with respect to claim 18 based on the examiner’s ﬁnding that the
differences between the teachings of Gamble and the limitation of claim 18 was such as to require
appellants to establish the criticality of the claimed amount of ﬁbers even in view of our opinion.

Kronig, supra; cf. Boon, supra; In re Waymouth, supra.

Accordingly, rm: decline to designate our afﬁrrnance of the examirrer’s rejection of claim 18 as a
new ground of rejection under 37 CFR § l.l96(b) (1997).

Appellants’ second contention is that we must reverse the yound of rejection of record because
we gave “the claimed phrase ‘in a [sic, the] resin’ . . . an unreasonable intmpretation by reading the
claimed phrase on an aqueous suspension of ﬁbers and powder resin” in our opinion (request, pages 1
and 7- 10). The subject phrase appears in the ﬁrst and second speciﬁed steps of the claimed method
encompassed by claim 1 (emphasis supplied):




*** PAGE 10 ***


Appeal No. 96-3533
Application 08/203,624

1. A method of dispersing ﬁbers in an electromagnetic-attenuating coating and applying the
coating to a substrate, comprising steps of:

mixingacoatingmaterialctmrprisingﬁbers andresininacontainerby shakingthecontainer
such that the ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in the resin without breaking tl1e ﬁbers;

feeding the coating rmterial from the container while maintaining the ﬁbers uniformly
dispersed in the resin and withtmt breaking the ﬁbers; and

applying the coating material to the substrate.

According to appellants, we improperly read “the claimed phrase on an aqueous suspension of
ﬁbers and powder resins” and thus “on Garr1ble’s ‘papermaking’ process” shown in Gamble Example 1”
that involves “stirring a slurry of . . . aluminum coated glass ﬁbers and . . . high density polyethyle
powders in . . . water,” which “mixes ﬁbers in water, not in a resin, as claim ” (request, page 7).
Appellants contrast this result with the “method wherein the ﬁbers are mixed in a molten resin,” citing
Gamble, col. 7, lines 14-25, which process they also describe as “dispersing ﬁbers in a resin matrix,”
citing Gamble, col. 5, lines 6-15 (id., page 8). In other words, appellants allege that ‘the Board
conﬁlses ‘mixing ﬁbers in an aqueous sltmy’ With ‘mixing ﬁbers in a resin’" (id., n.4; see also page 9).
Thus, the issue of claim interpretation involves essentially the ﬁrst stated step of the claimed method
encompassed by claim 1.

The difﬁculty that we have with appellants’ position is that (1) they have not stated why our
interpretation of the terms of claim 1 which lead us to apply the teachings of Gamble thereto as set forth
in our original opinion is unreasonable in light of the speciﬁcation as it would be interpreted by one of
ordinary skill in this art; (2) they have not expressly stated their interpretation of the cited claimed phrase

whatever enlightenment by way of deﬁnitions or otherwise that may be afforded by the written
description contained in the applicant’s speciﬁcation.” , without reading into these claims any limitation
or particular embodiment which is disclosed in the speciﬁcation. See In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321-
22, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989), citing In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162

citing Prater, 415 F.2d at 1405, 162 USPQ at 551. Thus, the terms in the appealed claims must be
given their ordinary meaning unless another meaning is intended by appellants as established in their

a complete exploration of the applicant’s invention and its relation to the prior art. [Citations omitted.]”).
When the speciﬁcation does not contain an express deﬁnition, we can an'iVe at a reasonable, supported
interpretation of the appealed claims that differs from that urged by applicants and determine the
patentability of the claims on that basis. Morris, 127 F.3d at 1055-56, 44 USPQ2d at 1028-30
(“Absent an express deﬁnition in their speciﬁcation, the fact that appellants can point to deﬁnitions or
usages that conform to their interpretation does not make the PTO’s deﬁnition unreasonable when the
PTO can point to other sources that support its interpretation”). Therefore, “[i]t is the applicants’
burden to precisely deﬁne the invention, not the PTO’s. See 35 U.S.C. § 112 ‘j[ 2 [statute omitted].”
Morris, supra.

We did not speciﬁcally interpret all or any part of the phrase “ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in
the resin” (emphasis supplied) appearing in the ﬁrst speciﬁed step of claim 1 in our original opinion.
We did interpret the transitional term “comprising” in the preamble to “open the claimed method to
include other steps,” on the authority of In re Baxter, 656 F.2d 679, 686-87, 210 USPQ 795, 802-03

further include any manner of ingredients, s11ch as viscosity modiﬁers, solvents or ﬂocculating
agents, which would facilitate or otherwise aﬂect the uniform distribution of any ﬁber
in the resin and/or the application of the mixed coating material composition on a substrate
(speciﬁcation, e.g., page 4, lines 16- 19, and page 6, lines 17-24). Baxter, supra. [Id.;
emphasis supplied.]

Thus, we found that mixing ﬁbers with resin in water in Gamble Example I resulted in a uniform
distribution of ﬁbers in the resin (id., pages 6-9).

We have not found a deﬁnition for the claim phrase “ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in the resin”
per se in our review of appellants’ speciﬁcation Nor have we found any disclosure which would
provide a deﬁnition for any part thereof, including “in the resin” and “resin.” The disclosure which
appears to pertain to the ﬁrst step of the claimed method encompassed by claim 1 is that “[t]he
S11CCBSSflll utilization of artiﬁcial dielectric coatings requires a uniform dispersion of ﬁbers in a resin matrix
and then applying the ﬁber-containing resin matrix onto a substrate in such manner as to provide random
ﬁber placement and uniform thiclmess control’ (page 3). It wo11ld thus appear that the art recognized
requirement is “a uniform dispersion of ﬁbers in a resin matrix” which can be applied to a substrate in a
“manner as to provide random ﬁber placement and uniform thiclmess control.” Indeed, the speciﬁcation
(e.g., pages 4-6) provides no further processing information other than the nature of the ﬁbers, the
physical manipulation by which the ﬁbers and resin are mixed and, with respect to the “resin,” that

[t]he ﬁbers are uniformly dispersed in a lightly loaded dielectric matrix material. The matrix
material comprises a resin material which preferably is a non— thermoplastic material. For

instance, the resin can comprise a thermosetting polymer material such as silicone. [Id., page
6.]

There is no deﬁnition of “matrix” in the speciﬁcation. The speciﬁcation concludes with a statement that
the disclosure is non—lirr1itir1g (id.).

On this record, we interpret the bare term “resin” in appealed claim 1 to have the customary,
ordinary meaning of a polyuneric resinous material recognized in the art of electromagnetic-attenuating
coatings. We ﬁrrther ﬁnd that the polymeric resinous material must be capable of forming a “matrix,” as
this term is ordinarily deﬁned, within which ﬁbers can be contained in a coating material such that the
coating material will form a coating containing the ﬁbers when applied to a substrate. There is no
limitation in claim 1 which would limit the “resin” other than its capability to form the stated coating.

Thus, we arrive at the point where our interpretation of claim 1 differs from that apparently
urged by appellants. The ordinary meaning of “matrix” is “A . . . surrounding substance within which
something originates, develops or is contained.” See, e. g., The American Heritage Dictionary
Second College Addition 772-73 (Boston, Houghton Miﬂlin Company, 1982). We have found no
ordinary deﬁnition of the term “matrix” which requires that the “surrounding substance” must necessarily
be a solid. The interpretation apparently urged by appellants is that the resin would form a solid
“matrix,” but they have not pointed to the basis in the speciﬁcation as it would be interpreted by one of
ordinary skill in the art or elsewhere for their interpretation.

Therefore, on this record, we ﬁnd it reasonable to interpret the claim phrase “ﬁbers are
uniformly dispersed hr the resin” to encompass ﬁbers uniformly dispersed in a resin matrix wherein the
resin surrounding the ﬁbers is in particulate form. Indeed, such amixtnre ofﬁbers unifrnnlydispersedin
a matrix of particulate resin would form a coating or sheet in which the ﬁbers would be randomly
oriented in the manner required for “successﬁtl utilimtion of artiﬁcial dielectric coatings” as stated in
appellants’ speciﬁcation (page 3), and, in our view, as shown by Gamble (e.g., col. 2, line 64, to col. 3,
line 7, col. 6, line 60, to col. 7, line 5, and Example 1). We are not persuaded otherwise by the use of
water by Gamble to disperse the ﬁbers in a resin matrix. Indeed, as we noted above, we interpreted the
claimed phrase “coating nmterial comprising ﬁbers and resin” in our original opinion to further comprise
any material “which would facilitate or otherwise affect the uniform distribution of any ﬁber in the resin.”
This would include water.

Accordingly, because appellants have not established that, on this record, our interpretation of
the claim terms of claim 1 is unreasonable, Morris, supra, we decline to reverse our afﬁrmance of the
examiner’s ground of rejection.

We have granted appellant's request to the extent that we have reconsidered our decision of
February 29, 2000, but we deny the request with respect to making any changes therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended
under 37 CFR § 1.136(a).
