Paper No. 24

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte JOHN H. DWIGGINS
and
DINESH M. BHAT

Appeal No. l997—0855
Application No. 08/248,543

HEARD: April l9, 2000

Before KIMLIN, WALTZ and KRATZ, Administrative Patent Judges.

KIMLIN, Administrative Patent Judge.

REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Appellants request reconsideration (rehearing) of our
decision of May l8, 2000, wherein we affirmed the examiner's
rejection of the appealed claims under 35 U.S.C. §§ l02 and

l03.

Appeal No. l997—O855
Application No. 08/248,543

Appellants submit at page 2 of the Request that we
inexplicably adopted the examiner's reasoning that element (d)
of claim 22 is "met by water supplied by conduit 45 to adjust
the consistency in mix tank 32" (page 4 of Answer).
Appellants maintain that "the means of element (d) must supply
'a slurry of fiber in liquid water,'" whereas "[p]ure water
supplied through conduit 45 of Cheshire 'l56 cannot satisfy
element (d)." Appellants contend that "mix tank 32, conduit
35 and pump 34 are not capable of supplying a slurry of fiber
in ‘liquid water‘ as mix tank 32 contains a 'foam—fiber'
mixture — not a 'slurry of fiber in liquid water'" (page 2 of
Request).

We are not persuaded by this argument because Cheshire
'956 expressly discloses that pump 34 is activated to supply
foamable liquid from silo 26 and mix tank 32 to the headbox.
Hence, the material delivered to the headbox through line 35
is a liquid that is capable of generating a foam.

Appellants also contend at page 2 of the Request that
"Cheshire fails to disclose a ‘means for combining said water
slurry of fibers with said foamed liquid‘ as required by

element (e)." In our view, it is clear from reading the

entirety of the Cheshire patents, e.g., '956 at column 5,
lines 11 g;_§gg‘, that lines 35 and 24 carry both liquid and
foam and are combined at the T in a mixture of foamed liquid
and a water slurry of fibers.

Appellants also submit at page 3 of the Request that we
erroneously concluded that claims 23-25 fall together with
claim 22. Appellants point out that the Brief states at page
9 that "[c]laims 23, 24 and 25 contain additional features
which make each of them separately patentable." However, such
a conclusory statement falls far short of the requisite
presentation of substantive arguments which explain why each
of claims 23, 24 and 25 would have been nonobvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art. See 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7) and
(c)(8) (1995). In the opening sentence of the paragraph at
page 9 of the Brief, referred to by appellants, appellants
treat all the appealed claims as a group. In particular,
appellants state that "[e]ach appealed claim in this
application (22-25) contains a limitation requiring: means
for mixing an aqueous slurry of fibers with foam to form a
foamed fiber furnish." Although appellants maintain at page 3

of the Request that "much of Applicants [sic, Applicants']

oral argument focused on the patentability of claim 24 as a

result of the novel incorporation of a positive displacement
pump" (emphasis added), it is well settled that arguments not
contained in the Brief are considered abandoned, and that such

abandonment cannot be resurrected at oral hearing.

O8/248,543

Appeal No.
Application No.

We note that appellants point to no argument in the Brief that

is specific to claim 24. Accordingly,

we find no error in our

holding that claims 23-25 stand or fall together.

In conclusion, based on the foregoing, appellants‘

request is granted to the extent we have reconsidered our

decision, but we decline to make any change therein.

No time period for taking any subsequent action in

connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR

§ l.l36(a).
