ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING

Pursuant to the provisions of 37 CFR § l.l97(b) (1997), the
appellants have submitted a request for rehearing of our decision
entered February 20, 2001, in which we affirmed the examiner's
rejection of appealed claims 9 and 10 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 but
reversed the rejection of appealed claims 2 through 8, 23 through 28,

and 30 through 44 under the same ground.

Appeal No. 1998-1663
Application No. 08/508,408

The appellants argue as follows:

The above step [i.e., the sputtering step of appealed
claim 9] clearly recites that the titanium film is sputter
deposited and that the sputter deposited film is a metal
film. After the titanium film is deposited, the oxidizing
step is pracziced. Clearly claim 9 recites that the step
of sputtering and the step of oxidizing are separate
steps. In i:s broadest reading the “sputtering and
oxidizing steps" of claim 9 are not conducted in one step.
[Request for rehearing, p. 2.]

The appellanzs then submit as follows:

Finley as read by the Board teaches sputtering to
deposit a tizanium oxide film. Applicants’ claim 9 as
discussed above covers sputtering to deposit a titanium
film and thereafter, oxidizing the deposited film.

Based on the above, applicants respectfully submit
that Finley zeaches depositing a metal oxide film; Khanna
also teaches depositing a metal oxide film. An artisan
combining Khanna and Finley would deposit a metal oxide
film. Applicants’ claims 9 and 10 on the other hand
recite that an amorphous titanium film, more particularly
a metal amorphous titanium film, is deposited, and
thereafter the film is oxidized. [Id. at pp.2—3.]

We cannot agree. As we stated in our original decision (page

6), appealed claim 9, unlike claim 31, does not recite that the
deposition of the film is operated below the “switch point.” Nor is
there any recitation in claim 9 that the deposition is conducted in
the “metallic mode” as described in the present specification.
Although the appellants urge that the recited oxidizing step is

practiced after the titanium film is deposited, appealed claim 9 does

not preclude the sputtering of a titanium film and the oxidation of
the film in one step. This is exactly what occurs in Finley or

Khanna.

In addition, appealed claim 9 does not recite the term “after”
or “thereafter” as the appellants seem to think. In re Morris, 127
F.3d 1048, 1056, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“It is the
applicants’ burden to precisely define the invention, not the
PTO’s.").

According to the appellants’ specification, “[t]he amount of
reactive gas is kept sufficiently low so that the sputtering mode is
essentially metallic, and the film deposited is essentially
metallic." (Underscoring added; page 14.) The term “essentially”
would indicate to one skilled in the relevant art that in the
broadest reasonable interpretation of appealed claim 9, the film
deposited by sputtering includes not only purely metallic but also
metal oxide films. Where the film deposited by sputtering is a metal
oxide, the oxidizing step would have occurred during the sputtering
step as in Finley or Khanna. In our view, the use of the term
“titanium film” as it appears in appealed claim 9 is purely a matter

of semantics, as one skilled in the relevant art would understand

this term in its broadest context to actually include titanium oxide
layers deposited in a “slightly oxidizing atmosphere" as described

in Finley or about 28% reactive gas as described in Khanna.

The appellants have proposed amending appealed claim 9 to

positively recite that the deposited film is a “titanium metal

film" and that the sputtering and oxidizing steps are separately
conducted, in the event that we agree appealed claim 9 “inherently
recites” these limitations. (Request, page 3.) However, 37 CFR §
l.l97(b) does not provide for such a proposal to amend appealed claim
9 at this stage. Therefore, it is not appropriate. Further, we do
not agree with the appellants that the limitations are “inherently”
recited in appealed claim 9. Quite oppositely, we find that the
appellants’ conditional proposal to amend further supports our
determination that appealed claim 9 is significantly broader in scope
than that argued by the appellants.

In summary, we have reconsidered our decision in light of all

of the arguments made in the appellants’ request. However, we see no
compelling reason justifying a different result. Accordingly, we

decline to modify our original decision.
