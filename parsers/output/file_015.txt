Paper No. 27

UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

BEFORE THE BOARD OF PATENT APPEALS
AND INTERFERENCES

Ex parte RICHARD W. HARRISON
and JOHN F. SCARZELLO

Appeal No. 95-4662
Application 08/048,101‘

ON BRIEF

Before THOMAS, FLEMING and CARMICHAEL, Administrative Patent Judges.

CARMICHAEL, Administrative Patent Judge.

ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING
This is a decision on a request for rehearing filed July 23, 1998 (Paper No. 26),
of our Decision dated July 14, 1998 (Paper No. 25). Appellants argue that: (1) our
decision is confusingly characterized as an amplification of the examiner's reasons

whereas in fact the opinion is inconsistent with the examiner's reasoning and presents

a new ground of rejection; and (2) claim 10 requires that transmitted signals be limited
to radiation emitted within and propagated through the water.
( 1) Consistency with the examiner's reasoning

Our decision began by saying “[w]e affirm for the reasons given by the examiner,
amplified as follows." Decision at 2. By the phrase “[w]e affirm for the reasons given

by the examiner" we meant that we agree with the examiner's rationale as stated in

the examiner's Answer. We adhere to that view. That is, we still agree that the
combination of teachings from multiple references as explained by the examiner would
have rendered the claimed subject matter obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.

By the phrase “amplified as follows" we meant that affirmance of the examiner's
rejection was further supported as set forth in the Decision. In particular, we found that
“the subject matter of claim 10 would have been obvious from Kirkland, with or without
the additional references cited." Decision at 4. This is consistent with the examinefs
rationale which states:

Appellants argue that the prior art differs from the present invention in that the

prior art transmits electromagnetic energy through air as well as through a body of

electrically conductive liquid, e. g. sea water. Namely it is argued that the primary

references to Kirkland (‘822) and to Shostak (‘520) show transmission of
electromayietic energy through air and sea water. Examiner is in agreement with

this point but fails to see how the present claim language precludes the prior art

rendering it obvious. The references do show transmission of electromagnetic

energy into sea water for the purpose of detecting a submerged object. This is the
teaching relied upon.

Exarniner’s Answer at 4, lines 2-12. We are in harmony with the exarniner’s position that
although Kirkland shows some transmission through air and some through water, the present
claim language does not preclude obviousness since Kirkland shows transmission via sea water as
claimed.

Relying on Kirkland alone does not constitute a new ground of rejection. In afﬁrming a
multiple reference rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103, the Board may rely on one of the one
references alone in an obviousness rationale without designating it as a new ground of rejection.
In re Bush, 296 F.2d 491, 496, 131 USPQ 263, 266-67 (CCPA 1961); In re Boyer, 363 F.2d
455, 458 n.2, 150 USPQ 441, 444 n.2 (CCPA 1966). Thus, our decision did not include a new
ground of rejection.

(2) Scope of Claim 10

Appellants argue in their Request that claim 10 requires that transmitted signals be limited
to radiation emitted within and propagated through the water. We disagree.

Claims undergoing examination are given their broadest reasonable interpretation
consistent with the speciﬁcation. In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1194, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1850

(Fed. Cir. 1994) (in banc).

Appeal No. 95-4662
Application 08/048,101

In the present case, Claim 10 recites processing means “for comparing differences in
analyses of the transmitted signals.” Appellant’s argument proceeds as if the recited ﬁmction
were comparing differences in only the water—transn1itted signals. Request at 2. However, Claim
10 is not limited to using only the water—transn1itted signals. Claim 10 broadly refers to
differences in “analyses” of the water—transmitted signals. The “analyses” are not necessarily
informed only by the water—transmitted signals.

Kirkland discloses the same means as Appellants for performing the recited function of
“comparing differences in analyses of the transmitted signals.” Kirkland’s processing means
compares differences in analyses of signals transmitted from transmitter T through water W to
receiver R at different times. Column 4, lines 29-40. Kirkland’s analyses of the water—transn1itted
signals involve the phase relationship between the water—transn1itted signals and the air-
transmitted signals, but such analysis is not precluded by the claims on appeal.

CONCLUSION
We have thoroughly reconsidered the appeal in light of the entire record including the

present Request. The modiﬁcation sought by Appellants is denied.
